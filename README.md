CSE204 project 2023 
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning software which when given the lyrics to a song tries to predict the artist. There are plenty of reasons to do this but perhaps the most important one is to detect ghostwriters writing lyrics for multiple artists. This is why we cannot expect very high accuracies and machine learning is appropriate.
Our system has been fed the lyrics from about 100 songs each of about 150 famous artists from about 10 genres and with a pool of 20 artists' works with over 60% accuracy. This was achieved after making 3 different models each of which improved on some shortcomings of the previous one: a kNN, a CNN, and a logistic regression.
