// Sovay //

I was getting ready to be a threat
I was getting set for my
accidental suicide
the kind where no one dies
no one looks too surprised
then you realize
that you're riding on a para-success
of a heavy-handed metaphor
and a feeling like you've been here before
because you've been here before
and you've been here before
then a word washed ashore
a word washed ashore
then a word washed ashore

sovay, sovay, sovay
all along the day

I was getting ready to consider my next plan of attack
I think I'm gonna sack
the whole board of trustees
all those Don Quixotes un their B-17s
and I swear this time
yeah this time
they'll blow us back to the 70's
and this time
they're playin Ride of the Valkyries
with no semblance of grace or ease
and they're acting on vagaries
with their violent proclivities
and they're playing ride
Ride of the Valkyries
sovay, sovay, sovay
all along the day

// Fake Palindromes //

My dewy-eyed Disney bride, what has tried
Swapping your blood with formaldehyde? 
Monsters?
Whiskey-plied voices cried fratricide!
Jesus don't you know that you could've died
(you should've died)
With the monsters that talk, monsters that walk the earth

And she's got red lipstick and a bright pair of shoes
And she's got knee high socks, what to cover a bruise
She's got an old death kit she's been meaning to use
She's got blood in her eyes, in her eyes for you
She's got blood in her eyes for you

Certain fads, stripes and plaids, singles ads
They run you hot and cold like a rheostat, I mean a thermostat
So you bite on a towel
Hope it won't hurt too bad

My dewy-eyed Disney bride, what has tried
Swapping your blood with formaldehyde?
What monsters that talk, monsters that walk the earth

And she says, "I like long walks and sci-fi movies
If you're six foot tall and east coast bred
Some lonely night we can get together
And I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather
And drill a tiny hole into your head"

// Banking On A Myth //

There's one guy I'd like to thank
He signs the checks and leaves them blank
He's the one
He says you don't have to walk a plank
The game is rigged, go fig your
Slide show tanked
And your flagship sank
So we're taking all our myths to the bank
So just don't forget who to thank
We're taking our myths to the
Drinking a fifth to the
We're taking all our myths to the bank
If you could just do him this favor
Although it might involve child labor
Join his entourage
Give him a foot massage
From Star Search to the Philharmonic
He'll get you there with Hooked on Phonics
He's the one to know
Doesn't matter if you blow â€“ no no
In fact it's just the thing
He thinks we're needing
It's a lukewarm liquid diet
They're force feeding
When the words we use have lost their bite
Now they hit you like an imaginary pillow fight
But it's all right
Cause you're inside
And you're in tight
Deals in commodities of the abstract sort
Buys them in bulk but sells them short
Talent, genius, love even signs of affection
He floods the market there's no price protection
And when his master plan is unfurled
There stands a handsome bid on the weather systems of the world

// Masterfade //

Well you sure didn't look like you were having any fun
with that heavy-metal gaze they'll have to measure in tons
and when you look up at the sky
all you see are zeros
all you see are zeros and ones
you took my hand and led me down to watch the kewpie doll parade
we let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
it's not that I just didn't care I must admit I was afraid
and I'm awfully glad my finger's resting gently on the masterfade
the masterfade
I coulda played along
the masterfade
I coulda played Mah Jongg
but it just takes too long
and I just can't remember
which way the east wind blows does it matter?
if we're all matter
what's it matter does it matter
if we're all matter when we're done?
when the sky is full of zeros and ones
I saw you standing all alone in the electrostatic rain
I thought at last I'd found a situation you can't explain
with GPS you know it's all just a matter of degrees
your happiness won't find you underneath that canopy of trees
if the green grass is 6 the soybeans are 7
the junebugs are 8 the weeds and thistles are 11
and if the 1s just hold their place the 0s make a smiley face
when they come floating down from the heavens
you took my hand and led me down to watch a papillon parade
we let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
you squeezed my hand and told me softly that I shouldn't be afraid
'cause all the while your finger's resting gently on the masterfade
the masterfade
I coulda played along
the masterfade
I coulda played Mah Jongg
but it just takes too long
and who the hell can remember
which way the east wind blows
when you're lying on the ground
staring up at an inverted compass
I mean Christ who knows?

// Opposite Day //

I got home this morning with the sun right in my eyes
And there was no warning as it took me by surprise as it
Hit me like an Act of God, causing my alarm
That I had not become a cephalopod
I still had legs and arms
Yes I still had legs and arms

Today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
Youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns, yeah yeah
And today was supposed to be

Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Was supposed to be, today was supposed to be
Opposite day

Those that can't quite function in society at large
They're going to wake up on this morning and find that they're in charge
But those the world's set up for, who are really doing quite well
They're going to wake up in institutions
In prison or in hell
Prison or in hell

Today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
Youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns, yeah yeah
And today was supposed to be

Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
It was supposed to be, today was supposed to be
Opposite day

But if you think there's something else
Well you're right, there is
There's something else
But if you think I'm gonna tell you, think again
Why should I even think of telling you what there is
Yeah, 'cause silence is knowledge
And knowledge is power
I'm under explicit orders to dare not speak its name
Listen up, I just work here
Oh I dare not speak its name
I can't keep talking about it
Oh, I dare not speak its name

// Skin Is, My //

My skin is
white as parchment
drier than a downtown office building
where the air is tight
there's time spent
resting on her bones
waiting for the telephone to ring
ba-ring ba-ring ba-ring ...
bo-ring bo-ring bo-ring ...

my skin is
cold as her toes on the bathroom floor
run back to bed and slam the door
oh what a lovely sound
oh how it shakes the ground
oh what a lovely sound
oh what a lovely sound
oh what a lovely...

skin is my
it's the only thing
that doesn't really fly in my land
and love, oh love
is my love is
it's the only thing that
butterfly in Thailand

let it be printed on every t-shirt in this land
on the finest of cottons and the hippest of brands
in bolder letters than the capital I
it's the only thing, it's the only thing
it's the only lonely, whoa

my skin is
white as parchment
drier than a downtown office building
where the air is tight
there's time spent
waiting for that
macrame bird of prey
to come down and sing
la-ling la-ling la-ling...
oh what a lovely sound
oh how it shakes the ground
oh what a lovely sound
oh how it shakes the ground
oh what a lovely sound

oh what a lovely sound
oh how it shakes the ground
oh what a lovely sound
oh how it shakes the ground
oh what a lovely sound
oh, oh what a lovely sound

// The Naming Of Things //

You remind me of you
The way you shot right through and how

You broke my window glass,
Fast, it happened so fast
I have to confess that I
That I was impressed that I
That I was impressed that I

Despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed

Here's where I disappeared
Where I fell off the pier
And to be rescued I did wait
I watched waterbugs skate
As they draw figure eights as they draw
From the bottom of the lake as they draw
I watched waterbugs skate as they draw
From the bottom of the lake I watched waterbugs skate

Memories, like mohair sweaters,
Stretched and pilled faux distressed letters
Moose's horns and figure eights
White plastic bags in search of mates
What suffocates the land
In the memory of a garbage can
Memory of a garbage can

But you, you can't be found when the bell rings
You weren't there that day for the naming of things

The naming of things
The naming of things

Where the homeroom bell rings
The homeroom bell

Hey, just look at the mess you made today
Didn't really think it would get this bad
Hey, feel like you're living in a Russian play
Where it seems like you made everybody mad

You remind me of you
When you shot through
And broke my window glass
It happened so fast
I have to confess
I was impressed, I was impressed
despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed

// MX Missiles //

Those that will judge
will say you're aloof
but you know the truth is a seed
you know what you need
is a conflagration
cause when I see your blood
and the bits of your broken tooth
it gives me the proof that I need
it's the proof that you bleed
and it's a revelation
it's a revelation
I thought you were a life-sized paper doll
propped up in the hardware store
propped up on the front lawn watching the parade
of the legionnaires with 2/4s
marching off to wars
I didn't know what you were made of
color of your blood what you're afraid of
are you made of calcium or are you carbon based
cause if you're made of calcium I'll have to take a taste
calcium is deadly, but tender to the tooth
but it's one sure-fire way to know if you're mx-missile proof
or if you're just aloof
and you were in the ground in late November
though the leaves and earth were damp
did you think they would remember
how you almost made state champ
and when you're running for the game against Alfonsus
and you fell up on the ground and chipped your tooth
that might really have surprised us
to learn that maybe you weren't really mx-missiles proof

// Tables And Chairs //

If we can call them friends we can call them on red telephones
and they won't pretend that they're too busy or they're not alone
if we can call them friends we can call
holler at 'em down these hallowed halls
just don't let the human factor fail to be a factor at all

don't
don't you worry
about the atmosphere
or any sudden pressure change

'cause I know
that it's starting
to get warm in here
and things are
starting to get strange

and did you
did you see how
all our friends were there
drinkin' roses from the can

how
how I wish I
I had talked to them
and wished they
fit into my plan

and we were tired of being mild
oh so tired of being mild
we were so tired

I know we're gonna meet someday in the crumbled financial institutions of this land
there will be tables and chairs
pony rides and dancing bears
there'll even be a band
'cause listen after the fall there'll be no more countries
no currencies at all
we're gonna live on our wits
throw away survival kits
trade butterfly knives for adderal
and that's not all
woah!
there will be snacks, there will
there will be snacks!
