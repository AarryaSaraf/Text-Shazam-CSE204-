Album: Thrills

// Minor Stab //

Somepeople was an angry thin-skinned man
Couldn't get along with his one man band
Quarter stick rocket and nails in his pocket
And a crying shame Somepeople is his name
Poor Old Pierrot Somepeople
What an unfortunate name
Some people have the low down notion that he is the one to blame
He used to take the train from old Montparnasse to Madrid
Hustles up a little under fifty quid
Underneath the shell is an angry fire
But who's the first to jump on the pyre
Poor Old Pierrot Somepeople
What an unfortunate name
Some people have the low down notion he is the one to blame.
Some people like to bake a honey coiled ham
Some people like to roast a leg of lamb
Some people have a complicated coat to mend
We'll all be milking goats in the end

// Ides Of Swing //

Some say April is the cruelist
And though I can be quite morose
The stiff who penned it on a fool's list of those who are chronically verbose
When your head starts craning back
And your breath comes short and fast
The music of the spheres start to bounce and sing
That's when you know you're swinging
When your eyes roll back into your head
And the sap of the trees on your fingers have bled
Swooning to the charms of Mephisto's waltz
That's when you know you've got some schmaltz
When you've got the evil eye and unconsciously growl
Your hands start shaking and you crouch and prowl
These terryifing symptoms are a sure-fire sign
That you're pimpin baby and your feeling fine
When you make love to whomever you please
And a bullet to the head feels like a soft warm breeze
Red suit green suit they're all there scheming
That's when you know you're dreaming
Yes you're dreaming , you are dreaming
I hope you are dreaming

// Glass Figurine //

You've got me sitting on your mantle like a little glass figurine
Why must you be so mean?
Don't you know I've got better things to do
I'm like a mail order product from a housekeeping magazine.
How utterly embarrassing,
well lady I'm not going to dance that dance.
Let the giraffes do it, let the sad clown cry.
Your porcelain kisses are not going to turn me shy.

No, I'm not your little boy,
your rosy-cheeked joy,
though the thought of you makes me sanguine
I'll do anything you want
but I won't be your glass figurine

Let the giraffes do it, let the sad clown cry.
Your porcelain kisses are not going to turn me shy.
No, I'm not your little boy,
your rosy-cheeked joy,
though the thought of you makes me sanguine
I'll do anything you want
but I won't be your glass figurine
I'm like a mail-order product from a housekeeping magazine
I'll do anything you want
but I won't be your glass figurine

// Pathetique //

I bear no grudge, even though my heart may break
Eternally lost love! I bear no grudge
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long time, I bear no grudge

Ich grolle nicht, und wenn das Herz auch bricht
Ewig verlornes Lieb! Ich grolle nicht
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long time, I bear no grudge

I saw you in a dream
I saw the darkness in your heart
I saw the snake that feeds upon your heart
I saw, my love, how utterly wretched you are
I bear no grudge, I bear no grudge
I'm over you, so come on come on ... come on back to me, okay?
Alright

// 50 Pieces //

You've been away for such a long, long time
Gone from the brickyard, gone from the mine
All these unfamiliar places used to find your measured paces
Now it's all arriving, now it's all just fine
I thought perhaps we could sit down for tea
Nein, was the cold reply of Frau ecstasy
Sitting on a mossy stump, among all the bottles drunk, breathe cold against the air
Oh I smell your ragweed hair, smoked to the bone, soaked to the bone I'm all alone, poor me
I thought perhaps we could sit down for tea
Nein, was the cold reply of Frau ecstasy
Hey, who's that old man in the overalls,
His cows lick the ice from off the stable walls
Hey, who's that old man in the overalls,
His cows licked the ice from off the stable walls

// A Woman's Life And Love //

Since I first saw him, I think myself blind.
I look around me, and it's only him I see.
His image floats before me,
So gentle and so kind, he has got a clear mind and firm courage
Oh, ring upon my finger, little golden ring
Devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart
Sisters come adorn me, banish foolish fear
Twine upon my furrowed brow the blossoming myrtle
I serve him and live for him
Belong wholly to him
Give myself and find myself transfigured by his brightness
Ring upon my finger, little golden ring
Devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart
The blissful dream of childhood has ended
Now I drink delicious death with you my love
Now you have me caused me my first pain- 
That really hurt.
You sleep, you hard cruel man, the sleep of death
The veil falls, the bell tolls, the black shawls, the carriage rolls
You, my whole world.

// Eugene //

Studies have shown that we, like sheep, are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the anaesthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on the young we will dine

Burn her pale blue shroud, and tread on her bones
The din of the boys club crowd, reveals we've always been clones
Oh this being true you know there's more than just two
In the cards are four aces so turn and shoot at twelve paces

Studies have shown that we like sheep are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the antisthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on the young we will dine

Burn her pale blue shroud, and tread on her bones
The din of the boys club crowd, reveals we've always been clones
Oh this being true you know there's more than just two
So tie up your laces for the gene pool race of races

// Gris-Gris //

Though I've never been to Venezuela, 
But everything's fine south of the Rust Belt line
I think I like it, yes those southern cats are really unique,
Tell me why does the grass always seem greener
I'm going to take a trip to New Orleans
Where nobody cares how you shop your wares, long as it sounds good
Yes, it's all about that spicy cuisine
Tell me, why does the grass always seem greener
Gonna skip this town and head on down to Louisiana
I'm gonna skip this town and head on down, take my advice
Folks up there will start a fight with a cold chunk of ice
Let's drink some mash and talk some trash till morning
Let's drink some mash and talk some trash till morning
This song's like a lost ship at sea that's the same as wandering

// Cock O' The Walk //

C'mon baby move over, I'm sittin' here tonight
C'mon baby move over, do the thing that's right
I can puff up my feathers, look real mean, be the old man that this here's scene.
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight,
Hold on there partner, my hat just ain't on right
Just a minute there govn'r while I set it right
It's a half turn left a half turn right, this old thing used to be bright white
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight.
I went on down to sports bar town to put mother hen in a fright
Took the 450 Addison to see pulaski at night
it's one for the money, two for the jack, three for the joe you've got to pay back
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight.
I think that might makes right.

// Nuthinduan Waltz //

I'm just an old yout, with a cane made of root
And a dog with a nasal disease
I sit when it's breezing, my dog's always sneezing
I swear it's the voice of Louise
Why do you do when you don't have a clue
And the only thing doing is nothing at all
'Cept wait for night fall when the will of the wind has its way in the grass on a summer's day
And the rope ends that hung above layers of dung had little on all sides but air
In the buzzing dry wheat that wisps my bare feet, I step on my doggie's despair
Why do you do when you don't have a clue
And the only thing doing is nothing at all
'Cept wait for night fall when the will of the wind has its way in the grass on a summer's day
I'm just an old yout, with a cane made of root
And a dog with a nasal disease

// Some Of These Days //

Some of these days you'll miss your honey
Some of these days I'll be going away
Some of these days you'll miss your honey
You know you're going to miss me sweet darling I'm going away
Some of these days you'll be sorry
Some of these days I'll be going away
Some of these days you'll miss your honey
You know your going to miss me sweet darling I'm going away
You will never know what your friend will do if they're going away
She will miss him oh little honey
She will miss him for I'm going away
Some of these days, oh little honey you know you're going to miss me sweet darling
I'm going away

You will never know what your friend will do if they're going away
She will miss him oh little honey
She will miss him for I'm going away
Some of these days oh little honey you know you're going to miss me sweet darling
I'm going away
