Album: Freedumb

// Freedumb //

[Muir, Paul, Pleasants, Clark]

Peace through politics - is a fallacy that does not exist
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Where's your freedom? We got your freedumb
Get your freedom, I got your freedom
Truth is hard sell but I know what goes over well
Lies and cheap and free so the profit margin works
exceptionally

Where's your freedumb I got your freedom
Get your freedumb we got your freedom

// Ain't Gonna Take It //

[Muir, Paul, Pleasants]

Ain't gonna take it - Amymore [3x's]

Don't mess with my head - don't mess with my head
Don't mess with my head - don't mess with my mind
Now you messed with me the very last time
Well I'm mad as hell - hell that's the truth
For someone like you I got no use

[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it - Anymore [3X's]

It's a quarter to pain - half past hate
I got to get moving cause I'm running late
It was all thought out, but now I'm breaking the pain
In a moment we'll find out who's the man
Well you should have stopped and seen that I'm not the one
Now there's no stopping what's got to get done
You shouldn't have messed with my head
You shouldn't have messed with my mind
And now you'll find out about cyco time

[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it - Anymore

You picked at my soul - you picked at my brain
You pushed my button like I'm a video game
You picked at my head you picked at my mind
But now you've picked on me the very last time
Cause I'm heavy on my mind and I'm light on my feet
That's just the sad facts thats not conceit
You picked at my head you picked at my mind
But now you've picked on me the very last time
Ain't gonna take it Ain't gonna take it Ain't gonna take it

[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it - Anymore [3X's]

// Scream Out //

[Muir]

Pressures charging try to stall - Pound my head against the wall
I've been feelings this for way to long
I've been fighting this for way too long
Something's bout to happen - get out of my way
Something's better happen - get out of my way

[Chorus:]
Scream and shout - let it out
Rip it out - Scream and shout
Scream and shout - let it out
Break it out - Scream and out
Scream out [5X's]

Hypnotized, Analyzed - A sorry attempt to sanitize
When I've been feelings this for way too long
When I've been fighting this for way too long
I guess I'll do it my way - your's don't work
I'm left to do it my way - your's don't work

[Chorus]

// Half Way Up My Head //

[Muir, Pleasants]

I don't know what it is
But I'm acting like I know
I don't like what I see
But I never let it show
You can not understand
What you were not meant to find
So I lock it in a vault
Halfway up my mind
Halfway up my head

Halfway up head
Halfway up my head - that's where it got stuck
If you're trying to change me - well you're just out of luck
I know what I am and how I must be
Halfway up my head

[Chorus:]
Halfway up my head
It got stuck
Halfway up my head

Halfway up my head in a back of a file
I put up a front with a wink and a smile
All of the things that you've done and you've said
Halfway up my head Halfway up my head

[Chorus]

When I don't know what to think
Then I don't know what to say
When I don't know what to do
I still do it anyway

So if I sound confused
You're listening all wrong
I take it piece by piece
And I cut what gets to long
Halfway up my head

Halfway up my head
That's where it got lost
Don't like what you said so the message got tossed
You can not lock up what was meant to run free
The spirit in me, the spirit in me
I don't ask for no help and I won't

// Cyco Vision //

[Muir, Clark]

You tell me what I wanna hear
I hear it all with my ears
But that won't do me any use
So I use my eyes to see the truth

I've got CYCO VISION
I use CYCO VISION
I said CYCO VISION
I see with CYCO VISION

It doesn't matter what you say ... bullshit
It only matters what you do ... no shit
You cannot take the easy way out with me
'cause I got cyco vision

You put a smile on your face
To try and hide behind your lies
But it just magnifies the pain in your soul that I see with my CYCO VISION

When you think with all your might
You change right to wrong and wrong to right
But it stays the same to me
'cause I got cyco vision

// I Ain't Like You //

[Muir]

Too much time on my hands
Too much salt in my wounds
Too much pain in my heart
Too many things to regret
I've been thinking
The cause of my confession
I've been thinking
The cause of my oppression
I've been thinking
What's causing my depression
I've been thinking
Because of my depression
Won't do that change again
Continuous lies never end

I'd hate myself if I thought like you
I'd have to hate myself to do the things you do
Cause I ain't like you
I ain't like you

Too much getting no where
Too much waiting to see
Too many lies have been told
Too many things thought in my head
I've been thinking
The cause of my confession
I've been thinking
The cause of my oppression
I've been thinking
What's causing my depression
I've been thinking
Because of my depression
Stand up small hypocrite
Your full of lies your full of shit

I hate myself sometimes that's true
But I can't hate myself enough to be like you

I ain't like you
I ain't like you
I ain't like you
I ain't like you

Dirty job rearrange
Smoke it up just taken change
I can not hate myself
I can not hate myself enough to be like you

// Naked //

[Muir]

I'm harmless won't you help me
I'm sickness only you can heal me
I promise that I always be there
I'm naked under my clothes

I'm feeling naked
I feel naked

My heart's bleeding why don't you help me
I'm screaming but still nobody hears

Helpless and naked
Helpless and naked
Helpless and naked
Naked, naked, naked, I'm naked

I'm harmless till I hate you
I'm tasteless that's why I'm with you
I'm sensless even on payday
I'm naked under my clothes

You saw me naked, you saw me naked

I'm saddned by all my failures
It's a good thing
I real good things I don't try

I miss you whenever I'm with you
Cause I thought that,
I thought that you were someone else

I saw you naked,
I saw you naked,
I saw you naked,
Naked under our clothes
We're all naked under our clothes

// Hippie Killers //

[Muir]

You're not educated you're just regulated
You're not educated you're just regulated
So if you're tired of getting pissed on
Until you get yourself our system
We don't need your help no way we're OK

Anarchy for me, fascism for you

Wedon't need no rule no way, we're OK

Try to contain us, we're gonna riot
The original hippie killers

You're not regulated
You're just not educated
You're not regulated
You're just not educated
So if you're tired of getting pissed on
You better get yourself our system

We're the original hippie killers
We're hippie killers

We're hippie killers, anarchy for me
We're hippie killers, fascism for you
We're hippie killers, anarchy for me
We're hippie killers, fascism for you
We don't need no rules no way !
Anarchy suicidal style

// Built To Survive //

[Muir]

You've heard about the war in my head
And I've been known to wake the dead
I'm not evil just possessed to skate
And feeling like shit, just don't feel great

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

So much time spent alone
And I'm still searching for my home

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

Had my scrapes with the law
Is that your mommy that I saw ?
They tried to ban us from L.A.
But every dog has his day

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive
And we're built to survive

It's 1999 and going cyco's all that's on my mind

Controlled by hatred lost again

What I don't need is a friend
I want more you fascist pig
We are family, we live to live

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

// I Wanna Get Sick //

[Muit, Pleasants, Clark]

I hurt myself so I can heal myself
I wanna get sick
I hate myself so I can love myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna release, I wanna get ill,
I wanna get sick
I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick

I feel my best when I am at worst
I wanna get sick
I fight myself to make peace with myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick
Sick sick sick bbb get sick, ya get sick

I confuse myself to understand myself
I wanna get sick
I punish myself to replenish myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna release, I wanna get ill,
I wanna get sick
I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick
Get sick get sick get sick

// I'll Buy Myself //

[Muir, Clark]

Quack quack wop woop

I'm about to get my thrill
And I don't it from no funny ass pill
I'm about to straight break loose
I could fight it but it ain't no use
I'm about it this far away
From going off and making someone pay
I'm about to buy myself

Quack quack wop woop

I'm about to toss and turn
No sleep tonight I got a lesson to learn
I'm about to throw a fit
I can't seem to find the time to quit
I'm about ready to roll
Light on my feet with my gutted soul
I'm about to get my thrill
Anyway I will

I'll buy, I'll buy myself
I ain't got, I got noone else
I'll buy, I'll buy myself
When i go on sale

I'm about 105
Died years ago, but I'm still alive
I'm about 17
It's time to reinvent the punk rock scene
I'm about one inch small
When it seems that's noone cares at all
I'm about to buy myself

Quack quack wop woop

// Gaigan Go Home //

[Muir, Wackerman]

Teach me and I'll teach you
If you need a hand I'll give you two
Respect me and I'll respect you
Disrespect me and I will destroy you

Gaigan kaera
Gaigan go home

Don't come back
Don't come back

Hope for the best expect the worst
This life it ain't no curse
Respect me and I'll respect you
Challenge me and I will destroy you

Gaigan go home
Don't come back
Don't come back if you ain't suicidal
Gaigan go home

watch what you say watch what you do
Cause I can give it back times ten to you
You challenge me so I will destroy you

Gaigan kaere
Gaigan go home

Gaigan kaera

// Heaven //

[Muir, Clark]

I'm so excited today I'm gonna die
But I'm going to heaven so there's no reason to cry
God says he loves me and I love him too
Yes I have struggled, but but now suffering's through

I don't want you to cry
I just wanna say
I'm so excited today I'm gonna die
But I'll live forever so it's not really goodbye
God has a plan for me and a plan for you

So there's no reason to cry
There's no reason to cry
Cause I'm going to heaven
I'm going to heaven
Yes I'm going to heaven
I'm going to heaven

Over head such a shinning light
As playful angels hover in flight
In the blindingly brilliant pure white
A sensation so peacefully
My soul rises separates from my body
The pearly gates I can now clearly see
I've gone to heaven
Hallelujah
I'm so excited again I'll never die
I'm up heaven so there's no reason to cry
