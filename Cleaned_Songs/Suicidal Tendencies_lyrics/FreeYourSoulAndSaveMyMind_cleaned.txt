// Self Destruct //

[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

Sometimes I wish my head would just explode!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I need the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop the urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I fight the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Where is the sunshine of my mind?
There is no sunshine in my mind!
How can I be everything to everyone?
Where is the sunshine of my mind?
When I don't want to be anything to anyone!
There is no sunshine in my mind!

I just wanna make the pounding in my head freakin' stop!

Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, I wanna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't fight this urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self de-struct!
Self destruct!

No...

// Su Casa Es Mi Casa //

The ticking you hear is your life passing you by...

Do you feel you're not taken serious?
That your input is brushed aside?
That you can get no respect
That people may even be laughing behind your back
Does this make you question your self-worth?
Well it should... because you're worthless!
Now take the case of the new-age cyco
Confident, commanding respect
Taking whatever he wants, from wherever it is

I've been thinking, so to speak
Knees are shaking, tired and weak
I've been wondering, who I am
I've been wondering where I am

Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco

If you have one, I'll have one too
Not another, the one I took from you!
Add my numbers, add it up
I guess I got it... give it up!

Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco

Now you've had some time to think
Why don't you look in the mirror, tell me what you see
Nah not on the outside, look inside, deep inside
The true ugliness
Not the self-created coloured hair, piercings hanging out everywhere
The stuff you try to cover up and deny
So there's a reason for everything
Now you let the reason out
Rising up, I feel it coming, let 'em know it's time!

I'm still wondering, why I am
Coughing up blood, spitting up phlegm
So much anger, hostility
Biting and kicking, inside of me
I'm fully cyco, partly hexed
Makes me wonder, who is next
You need not worry, about what I am
But you better worry, about where I am!

Su casa es mi casa
No quieres chingar conmigo

The ticking you hear is your life passing you by...

// No More No Less //

No More No Less
It takes more than A just making a fist,
It takes more than just getting pist
You gotta make your stand and resist
You Gotta Resist or You'll cease to exist
No More, No Less

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best

How can you see what I see
when everybody's coming down on me
How can you twist the list
and expect me not resist Ha ha ha
How can you explain all the pain
that goes terrorizing my brain?
Now you'll face a man that understands
that violence is the best plan its cyco time again!

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best
No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
No more No Less!

How can you call it cheating
if we're too smart to get caught
Come on everybody
let's show them what the fuck we got
Its time to get cyco
let's tear this mutha out
Anytime, anywhere, without a doubt, we're gonna take you out!

December 27th, 4:30 in the fucking morning. Sleep? Ain't no fucking sleep here, not with all these fucked up thoughts bouncing around in my fucking head, destroying every fucking thing it touches. Yea, this shit's been going on too long, but it's all coming to a fucking end, right now!

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that lives in you
Is breeding inside me too!

Free your soul and save my mind
I'm begging you to be so kind
There's so much power in your frown
Your sadness just brings me down!

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When I ain't got your back!

Free your soul and save my mind
You wish you were dead, I feel like I'm dying
If this is the price you pay for love
I feel sorry for God up above!

Free your soul and save my mind
Everything I can think of I'm trying
What does it take to make you listen?
Can't you see your soul is missing?

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When there's no turning back
What you gonna do?
If you can't get it back
What you gonna do?

So what you gonna do?
So what the fuck you gonna do?

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that breeds in you
Is fucking killing me too!

Hide behind your emptiness
Your soul is buried in an abyss
To make room for all the lies you believe
Your goodness is forced to leave

Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...

Free your soul and save my mind!

[guitar solo]

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!
