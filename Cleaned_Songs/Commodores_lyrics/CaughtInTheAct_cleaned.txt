// Slippery When Wet //

Listen to me brothers
Listen well
Brothers we got something to tell
You can't run around
Bein' a married man
And takin' care of business very well
You've got to keep yourself together
If you dig on what you got
Cuz what you got can sho' nuff mean a lot

If you ain't takin' care of business
This you must expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

You know hangin' loose can be outta sight
But hangin' loose
No it just ain't right
You see slippin' a tippin'
Havin' fun ain't no good
Leavin' homework undone
You've got keep your thing together
If you dig on what you've got
Cuz what you've got can sho nuff mean a lot

If you ain't takin' care of business
This you can expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

If you ain't takin' care of business
This you can expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

Uh huh slippery, slippery
Love gets slippery when it's wet oh
It'll slip away yeah
Love gets slippery when it's wet ooooooh
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Slippery, slippery
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Don't let your love slip away
Love gets slippery when it's wet ow
Takin' care of business
Love gets slippery when it's wetâ€¦

// This Is Your Life //

Do what you wanna do
So much in life to see you through
Be what you wanna be
Be strong and tell the world you're free

I see the children of the world
Searching to find themselves and who they are
So many roads for them to choose, yeah
So many ways for them to win or lose

Oh, this is your life
Oh...oh...yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah
This is your life
Yeah, yeah

I'll see you there
Dyin' in your wisdom
Where do you go, tell me
Where do you go

Just see the light
Shine through your window
Why can't you see, tell me now
Why can't you see

I'm longin' to see
If your search will find
Ah, peace of mind
Well...peace of mind

If this is your life (Yeah, yeah)
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah
This is your life, yeah, yeah

// Let's Do It Right //

Walking along
Trying to live our lives
Confused as we are
All trying to find our guiding star (Yeah)
Life's but a dream
For the time we spend here, that's what it seems
But you got to be strong
You got to know what's right and what's wrong
Oh, it's plain to see
We're not all the things we'd like to be
And if we had to live our lives all over

Let's do it right, now baby
We'll try the same things that we did before
But let's do it right this time baby
We'll do the same things that we did before (All right)

Love can be fun
Only if you got the right someone
How you can know, if she'll stay or if she'll go (Yeah)
[?]
Keep your head to the sky
We'll make a way for you by and by
Oh, it seems to me
Big strong men we all try to be (Yeah)
And if we had to live our lives all over

Let's do it right, now baby
We'll try the same things
Let's do it right, now baby
We'll do the same things

Let's do it right baby...

// You Don't Know That I Know //

You and another just passed me by
And I sat there smiling, smiling, just to hide my pride
Oh, you could have seen me, he was all that caught your eye
And oh, baby, baby, right there I realised... woah
You don't know that I know, girl

Oh, it's how you treat me child
You're gonna mess around and drive me wild
Why you wanna do me wrong, baby?
When you know I can't leave you alone... aah
Why you wanna do what you do to me, baby?
Woman... why?

I'll always love you, come rain or come shine... oh baby
Although you're running around, baby
I can't get you out of mind
Oh, you've got me wrapped up in your love, baby
Tell me what can I do?
I've been trying to give you up for a long time, baby
I'm still in love with you... woah
You don't know that I know, baby

I tried to give you loving, yes I did
Ha ha, my lovin'
Oh, woman, woman
Well, I could tell you 'bout yourself, baby
Things you think I don't know
I ain't crazy
I'm just in love with you, baby
Woo ooh... baby

You see girl, I'm not crazy
(Oh, I just wanna day, I just love you)
I just... I just love you (I care...I care) (ooh yeah)
You've been on my mind for a long long time (I tried to let you go but...)
I stayed home... sitting, watching, waiting...wondering...mm
(I'm watchin', girl)
I could find you, if I wanted to
(I...I...I just gotta...) (baby)
I guess, you'll be home one day
(Baby)
I'm gonna come home and I'm gonna be there so that I can hold you and squeeze you, (baby) and feel you
You're so clean, you're so...oh (baby)
You smell so sweet (baby)
(Baby)
You come here baby
(Baby)

(You don't know)
You don't know that I know, baby
(That I know)
Ooh baby
(You don't know)
Well, well, you don't know, girl
(That I know)
No no no baby
(You don't know)
Ow, you don't know that I know, girl
(That I know)
Well...
