// Peace //

How is there going to be peace?
When there is no justice, oh no, oh
Someone is taking more than their share
Of the bounties of this land and that's not fair

So little people got more than they need
While there's so many hungry mouths in the world to feed
And I am would give my heart so true
And I will give my love for you, tell me

How is there going to be peace?
When there is no justice, oh no, oh
Someone is taking my share
And they just don't give a damn, no they don't care

So, you just might as well face it
'Cause there ain't no other way to erase it
And I will give my heart so true
And I will give my love for you, tell me

// Haunted //

Haunted by your love
Wanted for your love

Wanted by the love of you and me
Haunted, memories won't let me be
So I keep rolling on till another battle is won
No one ever let go, I see reality show
And I'm haunted, wanted by your love

Haunted by the dreams of yesterday
Haunted, as I linger on today but I won't run away
Tomorrow is another day, no one ever give in
'Cause I know from my faith I will win
And I'm haunted by your love day by day

Only every time you're awake
I know how much I miss you, love you too
Oh girl, you're the most, from pillar to post
With my feet on the ground and my head in the sky
I'm on solid ground and I know we'll be riding high
And I'm haunted by your love day by day

Haunted by the visions that I see
Haunted, of the the mission to be free
With my feet on the ground and my head in the sky
I'm on solid ground and I know we'll be riding high
And I'm haunted, wanted for your love
Haunted by your love, haunted, wanted by your love

Oh honey, our love is fascinating
Ooh child, it's so amazing, yeah, in my dreams
Oh, your lies won't let me sleep
Haunted by your love

Haunted by your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love
Haunted by your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love

Wanted for your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love

// True Story //

We gave you history,
But what about the true story
Hidiing your heritage
to keep you into bondage
they stole your culutre
to say you got no future
destroyed your tradition
to keep you into subjection
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
they took the natural living
and gave you articificail living
they took the solcial living
and turned it into socilisim
they took the communl living 
and turned in into communisum
they took the capital living
and turned it into capitialism
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
my ancestors were kings of old
half the stories have not been told
they were mighty men and women
my children will be  like them
we are the seed of abraham
descneded from adam
we are the true born israleites
the true born ishmaelites
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
DON'T YOU LIE
Don't want your hizzim shcism
your just for the system
don't want your fo Lucifer
you call it your philosiphy
don't want your lies buried
you call it your library
We want the true story
