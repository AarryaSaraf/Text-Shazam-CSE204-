// I Want I Do I Get //

Say, say, say
Do, do, do
Say, say, say
Do, do, do

Wanting, needing
Saying, praying
Dreaming, hoping
Waiting, playing

Won't get you what you want
If you keep saying you can't
Won't get you what you need
Really in words and deeds

You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done

Thinking, planning
Wishing, longing
Crying, lying
Hesitating, procrastinating

Won't bring you sweet success
Won't bring you happiness
Won't bring you sweet caress
Won't bring you reprogress

You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done

Not enough to say, say, say
You got to do, do, do
It's not enough to say, say, say
Here's what you do, do, do

Not enough to say, say, say
It's all you do, do, do
Not enough to say, say, say
You've got to do, do, do

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get

// People //

There comes a time when we must fight again
For what we know to be the truth
here comes the day when we must rise again
To save ourselves reclaim our youth

So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world

There comes a time to gather round again
To sit and learn each others ways
As of today lets start to laugh again
And hope and Joy is here to stay

And people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
People lets get together and show our power
All over the world

Love sees the way to make the best of things
We know the truth lies in the simple things
The simple thing lest we forget

So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
People lets get together and show our power
All over the world

// Love Comes //

Love comes like a miracle...

Love comes to the rescue - whenever you need it
Love comes like a miracle so you better believe
It's true (it's true) - when I look deep inside of you
Just when I think I cannot find
Some peace of mind...

Love comes to the rescue - whenever you need it
Love comes like a miracle so you better believe
It's true (true) - when I'm lost for words to explain
And my heart is filled with the kind of pain
I just don't need
Oh...

Love comes to the rescue (to the rescue) - whenever you need it
Love (don't you know, don't you know that) comes like a miracle (like a miracle)...

Just when I think I can't find some peace of mind...
Love - love comes...
Love comes...
Let it in...

// Terror //

September 11th
Well it was Hell in Heaven

A Hell of a day
In the US of A

Terror hit the World Trade Center
In New York City
And the Pentagon
In the city of Washington

I saw it on T.V.
I thought that I was watching a movie
Like it was World War III
In the land of the brave and the home of the free

Where was 007
September 11th
And Superman
When they called 911

Now there's a war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror

Now there's a war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror

Terror, terror, terror
We must have a better tomorrow
We must have a better tomorrow now

September 11th
Another war in Heaven
All who were there
Said it was a living nightmare

But for every action
There has to be a reaction
This is the law of nature
Now we're living in the future

So when you're digging a ditch
I think you better dig two
One for the other man
And one for you

And when you're pointing a finger
When three points back at you
Be sure your hands are clean
I think you know what I mean

'Cause when you war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror

Terror, terror
Biological
Terror, terror
Environmental

Terror, terror, terror
We must have a better tomorrow
We must have a better tomorrow now

11th of September
The world will always
The year 2001
A new era begun

This was a wake-up call
To nations great and small

Terror been with you all the time
But you never paid it no mind

Oh, it's the Armageddon
A clash of civilization

With terror fighting terror
Tell me who can be the hero

I read it in Revelation
That there would be lamentation

A tale of God and the Devil
But good must overcome evil

// Take Your Time //

She says she loves me more than I do
And she says she's sorry
She promised me everything too
She tells me not to worry

But listen baby, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose
Listen baby, we got to find out
Which one of us you will choose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

She says she loves the way I smile
With lovely accent when I talk
She says she loves the reggae nights
The way I dance when I walk

But listen babe, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose
Listen babe, we got to find out
Which one of us you will choose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

Yan or Jimmy, Yan or Jimmy
I don't who to choose
Yan or Jimmy, Yan or Jimmy
Which one I'm gonna lose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life
