// Angel Eyes //

Try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mispent
Mispent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laughs' on me

Pardon me, but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes?

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes

// You And The Night And The Music //

You and the night and the music
Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?

Until the pale light of dawning and daylight
Our hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning may come without warning
And take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you

Until the pale light of dawning and daylight
Our hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning may come without warning
And take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you

You and the night and the music
You and the night
You...

// As Time Goes By //

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

// I Am A Fool To Want You //

I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the devil has known

Time and time again, I said I'd leave you
Time and time again, I went away
Then there'd come the time when I would need you
And once again, these words I'd have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong
It must be wrong
But right or wrong
I can't get along without you

Time and time again, I said I'd leave you
Time and time again, I went away
Then there'd come the time when I would need you
And once again, these words I'd have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong
It must be wrong
But right or wrong
I can't get along without you

// You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To //

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

// 'Round Midnight //

It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart
To stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin', I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart

And I'm out of my mind
Let our hearts take wings
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound

And I'm out of my mind
Let our hearts take wings
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
