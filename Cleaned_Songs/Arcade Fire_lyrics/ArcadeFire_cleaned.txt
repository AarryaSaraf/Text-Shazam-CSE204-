// Old Flame //

You knew in five minutes, 

But I knew in a sentence 

You knew in five minutes, 

But I knew in a sentence 


So why do we go through all of this again? 

Your eyes are flutterin' 

Such pretty wings. 

A moth, flyin' into the 

Same old flame again 

It never ends 


It's not like I dropped the bomb, 

on my conscience mom 

It takes fightin' day and night 

to make such a good thing die 


Out, everyone out 

I give too much shit at home 

In my heart and mind 

It gets me every time 


So why do we go 

Through all this shit again 

Your eyes are Flutterin' 

Such pretty wings. 

A moth flyin' into me 

The same old flame again 

It never ends

// I'm Sleeping In A Submarine //

She's gone to sea 

She's fightin' for me 

What bravery! 


I'm sleeping in a battle ship 

I'm sleeping in a submarine 

I'm sleeping in a fighter plane 

I'm sleeping going down the drain 


All hands on deck! 


The radio adresss 

What a mess! 


A cage is a cage 

Is a cage, is a cage!

// The Woodlands National Anthem //

I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us

Let's join the little babe's
Throwin' rocks in front of us

Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road before our parents send for us

Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float?
What I said was not a joke,
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope

Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!

Don't you dare blame my parents
I'm the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your parents
You're the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Mom's the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Dad's the only failed experiment
Don't blame God
Just blame God
Don't blame God

// My Heart Is An Apple //

I'll admit I'm full of shit

That's how I know I love you

That's how I know I trust you,

You're not sure if there's a right or wrong

But it feels like there is when I treat you like this

I go outside


Texas, I won't come home

Not even if you call

I can't hear you at all

I can't explain why it's a sin the state I'm living in

I just feel so tired

I go outside


My mouth is full, your heart is an apple

My mouth is full, your heart is an apple

Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme


Please don't even call

I can't hear you at all

// Headlights Look Like Diamonds //

The red lights mean you're leaving

The white one's mean returning

Tell me how this story ends

And I'll keep them fires burning


The headlights look like diamonds

The taillights burn like coals

Tell me how this story ends

Before the fires go cold


The countryside's deserted

There's no one on the farms

The suburbs all are sleeping

The earthquakes set off car alarms


All after all now we aware

All after all the time we share

There's so much fears of world,

Hopes of world, Tears of world

// Vampire / Forest Fire //

You wanna be set apart?

Burn all of your art repair the wasteful part

I'm a vampire in a forest fire

Hey! we all gotta keep warm

driving towards the storm


Your father was a pervert

Face down in the dirt

He taught you how to hurt

My father was a miner who lived in the suburbs

Let's live in the suburbs

If I let where I'm from burn I can never return!


My brother reads you and me his new poetry

How embarassing

Your sister pours the gasoline

I'll fix your meals

while your burns heal!


Find a house you don't have to rebuild

Stone by stone, brick by brick, nail by nail my father never meant to leave me this

Let this love last

I drive too fast

Said I'd return if I'd ever cared

But there's no interstate I find to take me there
