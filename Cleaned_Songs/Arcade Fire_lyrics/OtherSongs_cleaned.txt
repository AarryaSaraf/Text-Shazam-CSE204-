// Abraham's Daughter //

Abraham took Isaac's hand and led him to the lonesome hill.
While his daughter hid and watched,
She dare not breathe, she was so still.
Just as an angel cried for the slaughter,
Abraham's daughter raised her voice.

Then the angel asked her what her name was,
She said, "I have none."
Then he asked, "How can this be?"
"My father never gave me one."

And with his sword up, raised for the slaughter,
Abraham's daughter raised her bow.
"How darest you, child, defy your father?"
"You better let young Isaac go."

// Alligator Mine //

Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again before you

Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You run away again my
I wont stay alligator mine

// Baby Mine //

[RÃ©gine Chassagne:]
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

[Win Butler:]
Little one when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your head to your toes
You're not much, heaven knows
But you are so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

Oh, baby of mine
Oh, baby of mine
Oh, baby of mine

// Burning Bridges, Breaking Hearts //

Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
No home to come home to
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
I won't look you in the eye
And burning bridges, breaking hearts
Caught you in a friendship lie

Took a visit, to your old house
The windows were all boarded up
Try to hold these, memories
The ocean in a paper cup
There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
To the lion, you've been cast
Only bones are gonna last

There's a city, underground
There's a city made of glass
There's a city, underground
Hurry cause it's breaking fast

There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
Burning bridges, breaking hearts
(breaking hearts)

Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

// Can't Let Go Of You //

Where we gonna go 
I'm gassed up, I'm ready to go
Grab your jacket, Let's hit the road
We can't wait any longer, Let's go

She's looking out the window
And her baby starting to show 
From five months ago 
So keep driving, keep driving through the snow

I passed by my folks on side of the road, but I'm through it everyone
We can't let go, You can't let go of the wheel
And I pass by my friends on either end, But I'm through it all of them
I can't let go, We can't let go of the wheel

Hoping land for miles is Nebraska in my eye
And we still crystallize
Any longer any longer 

Trees and power lines are all dressed in the ice
And we still crystallize 
Keep moving keep moving through the eye

See the road swallow us whole, and we're still alive...
But I cant let go, I cant let go of the wheel
And water break on a burning wick and douse the flame kill her quiver 
We cant let go, We cant let go of eachother
Shes crying saying it's nobody's fault, shes already a pillar of salt
We're too dissolved, we're too dissolved into the road

// Cars And Telephones //

I read the pages about me
In her autobiography
They were brief and to the point

Our flesh, while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait until it's over

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

I walked to get the mail today
I guess your letter never came
I'll just check again tomorrow

A flash while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait without saying a word

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

But fuck it, I love you even if, I'm gonna feel like shit
By the time I get to you, now the sky is turning blue

The stars they disappear one by one as the daylight nears
And yes you're in my head, but that doesn't make you here

And I've lost all my friends, but you're the one I miss the most
And now I'm almost there, yeah, I'm almost to the coast

And if I had any notion of how I'm gonna drive my car across
The Atlantic Ocean I'd be fucking set

// Cold Wind //

In the middle of the summer
I'm not sleeping cold wind blowing
In the middle of the night
They try to find me but I'm still driving

If you're going to San Francisco
Lay some flowers on the grave stone
There's music on the station
And I'm just listening to cold wind whistling
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers cold wind, cold wind
Cold, cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing

Hey hey hey

Something ain't right
Something ain't right
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers cold wind, cold wind
Cold, cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing

// Generation A //

This is Generation A and we're not gonna wait!

They say wait a little longer
And the times are gonna change
They say wait until tomorrow
Yesterday is always strange
They say wait until you're older
And you will understand
They say the generation's coming
But I don't think they understand
That I am not a patient man

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
Too little, too late

(Wait)
They say wait until you're ready (Wait)
Wait until your number's called (Wait)
They say "Wait, all we need is love"
But darling, California's burning
New Orleans is waiting for the flood

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
(They think they can take us)
Too little, too late
I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
It's too little, too late

This ain't the summer of love
This is the summer of rock
Racist running, cities burning
Children show you what they're learning
Whole world finally fade away
Walk like generation A

I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
Too little, too late
They think they can take us
I can't wait
I can't wait
Too little, too late
It's too little, too late

// Lenin //

When Lenin was little
All the birds in the boat were singing, "Man this is it"
Now that he's older
All the sailors in heaven are singing up and shit

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say in my head

When Lenin was little
He stung like a vampire on all hollows eve
All the saints of heaven
Looking down at the leaves falling off the tree

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy, daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment

Daddy, daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy, daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment

Daddy, daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent

// Milk And Honey //

Sunlight loves me, feeds me milk and honey
Daytime misses me, feeds me milk and honey
Can't stop thinkin, bout my own breathin
Everytime I wake up I feel

Home sick, sea sick, love sick, car sick
Come home, come home quick
Jack jump over the candle stick

Sunlight loves me, feeds me milk and honey
Daytime misses me, feeds me milk and honey
Can't stop thinkin, bout my own breathin
Everytime I wake up I feel

// Surf City Eastern Bloc //

It's a shame about the roadblock
We're afraid that we'll get caught or stopped
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk, my surfboard on top

The eighties ain't been kind to anyone
I just want to find myself some sun
It's 1984, I'm on the run
Goodbye Berlin, hello Autobahn

It's a shame about the roadblock
If they catch us we won't ever talk
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk when the inspector knocks

// The Year Is //

I see the lightning almost every day
I've stopped pretending its a bird of prey

My little brother's got a strange disease
he gives a name to everything he sees

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

We heard the thunder on your daddy's farm
your momma said it was a fire alarm
the neighbors heard it and they started to run
we were deciding what to name our son

Let's call that son of a bitch

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

The years is...
(shout out any year that comes into your head, its all the dark)

// Virgin Mary Highway //

I lay on my back in the lake at night in the summer time trying to remember
Every last second, every last breath that I spent with you
The yellow dotted line, reflected in your eyes
You scream as the crickets fly in the open window
Please don't cry love

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her
Let's ask her blessings today

We've both felt love before even if we deny it
That familiar feeling of believing that we'll die without it
But we never do, well not completely

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her lets ask her blessings today

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah
