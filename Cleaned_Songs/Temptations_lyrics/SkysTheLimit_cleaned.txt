// Gonna Keep On Tryin' Till I Win Your Love //

Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I laid eyes on you
I know your love, your love belongs to someone else
But girl, I got to have you for myself (For myself)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love
Girl, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love

A fallen star (A fallen star) that's what you are, from the heavens above
Girl, no treasure on earth can match your worth
You're a picture of love
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy
But you're wrong
I love ya and I need you, by my side (By my side)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love
Girl, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love

I can't help but envy the guy that's got you by his side
Lord, he's got everything
There's is no end to his happiness
Girl, to be in his place, I'd gladly give you anything, oh yes I would
I know your love belongs, belongs to him
But I could never be satisfied just being a friend (Being a friend)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
