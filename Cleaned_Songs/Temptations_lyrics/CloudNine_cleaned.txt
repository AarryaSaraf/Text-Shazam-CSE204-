// Cloud Nine //

A-who, who, awho, who...

[Dennis:]
The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city.
It was a one room shack we slept in, other children beside me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was a hard times, needed something to ease my troubled mind.

[Paul:]
Ooo, listen.
My father didn't know the meaning of work.
He disrespected Mama and treated us like dirt.
I left home seekin' a job that I never did find.
Depressed and down-hearted, I took to Cloud 9.
I'm doing...(fine)
Up here. (On cloud nine)
Listen one more time.
I'm doing...(fine)
Up here. (On cloud nine)

[Dennis:]
Folks now they tell me.
They say, give yourself a chance and don't let life pass you by.
But the world around you is a rat race.
Where only the strong survive.
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie. (Ain't no lie)
Listen, it ain't even safe no more, to walk the streets at night.

[Eddie:] I'm doing fine on Cloud 9.
[Dennis:] Let me tell you about Cloud 9.

(Cloud 9) [Paul:] You can be what you wanna be.
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You ain't got no responsibility.
(Cloud 9) [Eddie:] Every man, every man is free.
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You're a million miles from reality.

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9.

[Eddie:]
I wanna say I love the life I live.
And I'm gonna live the life I love.
Up here on Cloud 9.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm riding high on Cloud 9.

[Dennis:] You're as free as a bird in flight.
(Cloud 9) [Melvin:] There's no diff'rence between day and night.
(Cloud 9) [Eddie:] It's a world of love and harmony.
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You're a million miles from reality.

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9.

[Paul:] You can be what you wanna be.
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You ain't got no responsibility.
(Cloud 9) [Eddie:] Every man in his mind is free.
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You're a million miles from reality.
(Cloud 9) [Paul:] You can be what you wanna be.

Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom...
[Eddie:] I'm feeling fine on Cloud 9.

// I Heard It Through The Grapevine //

I bet you're wondering how I knew.
Ah, what you're plans to make me blue.
With some other guy you knew before.
Between the two of us, you know I love you more.

[Dennis:]
It took me by surprise I must say, when I found out yesterday.
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

I know a man ain't supposed to cry.
But these tears I can't hold inside.
Losin' you would end my life you see.
'Cause you mean that much to me.

[Eddie:]
You could have told me yourself,
Oh, that you love someone else.
Instead I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, and I am, and I am just about lose my mind.

Ah, boom, boom, boom,...[etc.]

[Dennis:]
People say believe half of what you see.
Oh, and none of what you hear.
Whoa, I jus' can't help being confused.
If it's true please tell me dear.

[Eddie:]
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you left me for
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
Oh, heard it through the grapevine.(Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
Woo, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)
Oh, heard it throught the grapevine.(Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)

// Runaway Child, Running Wild //

You played hooky from school
And you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay, yeah
Now you feel like
The whole world's pickin on you
But deep down inside you know it ain't true
You've been punished cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care
Cause you already made up your mind

You wanna run away, yeah
You're on your way
Run away child, running wild
Run away child, running wild
Better come back home
Better come back home
Where you belong
Where you belone

Roaming through the city
Going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey it's getting late, where will you sleep
Gettin kind-a hungry
You forgot to bring something to eat
Oh lost with no money, you start to cry
But remember you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin eyes
Siren screamin down, neon light is flickin
You want your mama
Ah there's nothing for you
You're frightened and confused I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
You wanna hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go
Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice
Cause you're lost and alone
But remember you make the choice

Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong
Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong

You're lost in this great big city
(Go back home where you belong)
Not one familiar face
Ain't it a pity
(Go back home where you belong)
Oh run away child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong
Mama, mama please come and see about me
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say I want my mama
You're frightened and confused
Which way will you choose

// Love Is A Hurtin' Thing //

For every little kiss there's a little teardrop.
For every single thrill there's another heartache.
The road is rough.
The going gets tough.

Yes love is a hurtin' thing.
And oh love is a hurtin' thing.

When you're in my arms I'm king on a throne.
But when we're apart I walk the streets all alone.
One day happiness,
The next day loneliness.

Yes love is a hurtin' thing.
And oh love is a hurtin' thing.

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring so much pain?
Yes it's a mystery that nobody can explain.

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you.
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two.
But I want you so,
and I want you to know that

Love is a hurtin' thing.
Oh sweet love.
Oh sweet love.

// Why Did She Have To Leave Me (Why Did She Have To Go) //

There were times I knew
But I found it hard to say
You were special in my life
Never thought you'd go away

I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

If I ever made you cry
Any reason I can't find
It was lonely by your side
Like a fool, I stood by you
I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

Is there something I could do
Is there something I should say
Is there someone else to keep you from
And now (Woah, woah, yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah)

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind

You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Why should I
Even try

// I Need Your Lovin' //

Da-da-da-daa-da-da-hoo
Da-da-da-daa-da-da-da-hoo-hoo

You say you gonna leave me, for the arms of another.
You say my love for you is no good and we can't go any further.
But have pity on me.
I was blind but know I see.
Stay with me and never walk out of my life.

Because...
Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Inspite of all the wrong I've done, I'll make it up to ya.
Even if it takes all my life, I'll prove my love to ya.
So please don't go away.
With me always stay, 'cause I love you.
And I couldn't stand it being away, girl.

Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Girl, restore the faith you had in me.
I'm beggin' you down on my knees.
Please don't take your love from me.
Don't leave me, don't leave.

Forgive this fool, for causing your heart to suffer.
Remember two wrongs don't make a right, it'll only make things tougher.
So have little sympathy, on a poor fool like me.
And stay with me, please don't walk out of my life.

Because...
Ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
Oh, ooo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)

Oh baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin')
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh-oh-oh (I need your lovin')
I need your lovin' baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')
I need it, I need it.

// Don't Let Him Take Your Love From Me //

Hmm, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new.
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm-a kissing you.
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place.
Go on, just see if you can.

I'm-a begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Baby, please. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I'm begging you, baby. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)

So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear.
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear, huh.
My love are like mountains.
That's how strong it is for you.
If you ever walk away in to his arms
Which will surely break my heart in two.

I'm begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, I'm begging. (Don't, don't you let him)
No, no, no, no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby.

[Instrumental]

If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair.
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me.

Baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
Baby, baby, please. (Don't, don't you let him)
I couldn't stand it. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I ain't too proud to beg. (Don't, don't you let him)

// I Gotta Find A Way (To Get You Back) //

Woo
Since you've been gone, girl.
Said that, I've been so all alone, girl.
You've got me afraid, afraid to close my eyes.
Each time I do it's you I visualize.

Baby, baby, I can see you walking away. (Walking away, girl)
Just like you did that day, girl. (Did that day, girl)
The same hurt that I felt when we parted.
Baby, baby, once again I started.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo, I gotta find a way. (...to get you back, girl)
Ooo (I'm so lonely)

Nights I can't sleep, girl.
I tell you without ya, I'm weak girl.
Listen, not one single day, day goes by.
Can I wake up without tear-filled eyes.

Listen, I'm very seldom leave my lonely room. (Leave my lonely room, girl) (?)
'Cause without ya my life is filled with gloom. (Filled with gloom, girl)
There is no inch of the tears that I shed.
Girl, I'm slowly going out of my head.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo, gotta get you back. (...to get you back, girl)
Oh yeah. (I'm so lonely)
I gotta get ya back, girl.

(Gotta find a way to get you back, oh baby.)
(Gotta find a way to get you back, oh baby.)

Ooo, girl, I, girl, girl, ooo
Now when I'm out walking.
Huh girl, I always wind up on your street.
Look it here, I'm just a broken hearted guy.
In a dark and lonely world.
In need of a love you took from me.

Baby, baby all I do is think about you, baby. (Thinking about you)
It's a cold, lonely world without you. (Cold world without you)
Girl, my heart ain't getting no stronger.
I just can't carry on very much longer.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo (...to get you back, girl)
Got to get you back.
I, I, I, I (I'm so lonely)

I gotta get you back. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Oh baby, baby (Oh, baby)
I gotta get you back. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Woo, look it here. (Oh, baby)

I got to find a way to get you back... (girl)
Woo (I'm so lonely)
I gotta find a way. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Oh baby, baby, baby (Oh, baby)

I gotta find a way. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, baby)
I got to find a way to get you back... (girl)
Oh, ooo (I'm so lonely)
