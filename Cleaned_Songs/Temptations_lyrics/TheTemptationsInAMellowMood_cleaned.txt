// Hello Young Lovers //

Hello, young lovers whoever you are.
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight.
I've been in love like you.

Be brave. (Be brave)
Young lovers, why don't you come home,
Follow your sorrow. (Oh, yeah)

Be brave and faithful and true. (Be brave and faithful and true)
Be very close to each other tonight. (Whoa, yeah)
I've been in love like you.

[Instrumental]

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels.
And to fly, and to fly, and to fly down the street in a trance.
[David:] In a trance, in a trance, in a trance.
Fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet.
And you'll meet, not ready by chance. (?)

Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do.
Don't cry because I'm alone.
[David:] Don't cry because I'm all alone, now.
All of my memories are happy tonight.
I had a love of my own.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own.

Hello, young lovers, whatever you do.
Don't cry because I'm alone.
[David:] Don't cry because I'm all alone, now.
All of my memories are happy tonight.
I had a love of my own.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own, like yours.
I had a love of my own.

[Eddie:] Hello young lovers whoever you are.
[Paul:] Hello young lovers whoever you are.
[Otis:] Hello young lovers whoever you are.
[David:] Hello young lovers whoever you are.

Hello.
Hello.
Hello.

// A Taste Of Honey //

Winds may blow over the icy sea
I'll take with me the warmth of thee
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine
I will return
I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

I'll leave behind my heart to wear
And may it ever remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine
I will return
I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

He never came back to his love so fair
And so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss of honey
A taste more bitter than wine
I will return
I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
I'll come back for the honey and you!

// For Once In My Life //

For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.
Someone I needed so long.

For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me.
Some how I know I'll be strong.

For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of.
Long before I knew.
Aww, someone like you
Would make my dream come true.

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me.
Not like it's hurt me before.

For once I have something
I know won't desert me.
I'm not alone anymore.

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it.
As long as I know
I have love I can make it.

For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it.
Long as I know
I have love I can make it.

For once I can feel
That somebody heard my plea.
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me.

(For once in my life)
(In my life)

// Somewhere //

Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
Somewhere...

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere

There's a time for us
Someday there'll time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
Someday, somewhere

We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere...

There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow...
Someday, somewhere...

// Ol' Man River //

Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day
Don't look up and don't look down
Ya don't dast make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somepin', but he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands in ja-ail
I gets weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin'
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along

// I'm Ready For Love //

As I stand alone on this moonful night.
For the first time I feel alone in life.
As I watched the moon kissed the star-lit skies.
I feel the need for your lips to press close to mine.

For so long, I've been afraid to love.
But right now I feel a need for love.
And you have the love, love I need. (Right now)
Aw, to comfort me.

Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Ooo, and I'm ready for love.

I tried to shield my heart from love tender touch.
'Cause to lose a love, aw, would hurt so much.
But as I softly walked in my solitude.
I search my heart and I found there's a need for you.

And for the first time I feel alone.
'Cause I need a love, aw, to call my own.
And only you, have the love, the love I need.
Aw, to comfort me.

Ooo, and I'm ready for love. (Ready for love)
I'm truly ready for love. (Ready for love)
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love. (Sweet, sweet love)
Aw, and I'm ready for love.

I ready (right now.)

And for the first time I feel alive.
Have the tender love, deep down inside.
And just as soon as I see a smiling face,
I rush into your warm embrace.

Right now, I'm ready for love.
I'm truly ready for love.
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love.
Right now, I'm ready for love.
Comfort me, baby. (?)
Aw, I'm ready for love.
Wonderful sweet, sweet love.
Aw, I'm ready for love.

// Try To Remember //

Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain so yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a young and a callow fellow

Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow-follow, oh-oh

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was an ember about to billow

Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow-follow, oh-oh

[brief instrumental interlude]

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
Without a hurt, the heart is hollow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made you mellow

Deep in December our hearts should remember
Then follow-follow, oh-oh Follow, oh-oh

// Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me) //

Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
So I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me

I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me
But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
'Cause with you I could learn to
With you on a new day

But who can I turn to
If you turn away
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

// What Now My Love //

What now my love, now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, so numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal
Stripped off my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars, baby, tumbling around me
There's the sky, where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool, I'd be a fool to go on and on and on and on
I know that no one would care, baby, no one would cry
If I should live or die, no one would care, if I should live or die, oh, oh

What now my love, now that there is nothing
Only my last, my last goodbye
What now my love, what now my love
What now my love

// That's Life //

That's life, that's what people say.
You're riding' high in April,
Shot down in May.
But I know I'm gonna change that tune,
When I'm back on top in June.

That's life, funny as it seems.
Some people get their kicks,
Steppin' on dreams;
But I don't let it get me down,
'Cause this ol' word keeps getting around.

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,
A poet, a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face,
I pick myself up and get back in the race.
That's life, I can't deny it,
I thought of quitting,
But my heart just won't buy it.

If I didn't think it was worth a try,
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die.

// With These Hands //

With these hands, I will cling to you
I'm yours forever and a day.
With these hands, I will bring to you
A tender love as warm as May.

With this heart I will sing to you
Long after stars have lost their glow
And with these hands, I'll provide for you
Should there be a stormy sea

I'll turn the tide for you
And I'll never
No, I'll never let you go

// The Impossible Dream //

To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afat
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
The fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
To fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream
