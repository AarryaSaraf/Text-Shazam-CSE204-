// You Make Me Feel So Young //

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to go play hide and seek
I want to go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-not

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
You make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
You make me feel so, you make me feel so
You make me feel so young

// Beat Me Daddy, Eight To The Bar //

I hear you plunkin' with a bass and guitar, oh yes
Oh, beat it Daddy, Daddy eight to the bar

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But this guy he likes the best is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he dance with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he dance with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"

Plunk it, plunk it, plunk it, Herby

I hear you plunkin', I hear you plunkin', I hear you plunkin', Herby
Eight to the bar
Come on and beat me, come on and beat me
Eight to the bar

Plunk plunk, plunk plunk the guitar
Plunk plunk, plunk plunk the guitar
Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar

Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar

Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar

// Like Young //

I'm out doin' the usual places
And I'm livin' it, like young
Then I dig me this face of all faces
He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

We start blowin' the pad around 'leven
And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
If he were to brush me and go
I'm starting to wear my hair again
Like a square again

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
And we're makin' it like young
Love soft as April snow
Love warm as candle glow
Love, love is easy to go

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
Without him I'm no good at all
Without him I'm less than a decimal
Infinitesimal

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville or Wowsville
We're makin' it, makin' it like, like, like young

// Moonlight Becomes You //

Moonlight, becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear

Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind, if I tag along?

If I say, I love you, I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight, although
Moonlight becomes you so

All dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind, if I tag along?

If I say, I love you, I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight, although
Moonlight becomes you, moonlight becomes you so

// You Turned The Tables On Me //

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true

I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more?
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own

But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own

But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Tell me what's happening to me?
I'm so up a tree
Because you turned the tables on me

// Gypsy In My Soul //

If I am fancy free
And love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

There's something calling me
From way out yonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content havin' my way

There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

No cares, no strings
My heart has wings

There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

If I am fancy free
And I love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

There's something calling me
From way out yonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content havin' my way

If I am fancy free
And love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

There's something calling me
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

// St. Louis Blues //

Oh I hate to see that evening sun go down
Yes I hate to see that evening sun go down
Just because my baby he has gone and left this town
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like a feel today
If I'm feeling feeling tomorrow just like a feel today
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway

St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Pulls that man around by her apron strings
If it wasn't for powder and for store bought hair
The man I love wouldn't gone nowhere
Nowhere

Got the St. Louis blues blue as I can be
Got the St. Louis blues blue as I can be
My man got a heart like a rock cast in the deep blue sea

He may be your man but he comes to see me sometime
Yes he may be your man but he comes to see me sometime
Live six flights up and that man he sure love to climb

Wouldn't give a blind sparrow an acorn
Wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch
Wouldn't give a blind sparrow an acorn
Wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch

Ain't gonna give you nothing
Cause you think you're such a much and much
Got the St. Louis got the St. Louis
Got the blues got the blues got the blues blue as I can be

[scat]

Mississippi river long deep wide
I got to meet my sweet man on the other side
Take me back to St. Louis back to St. Louis
Got the St. Louis Blues just as blue as I can be
