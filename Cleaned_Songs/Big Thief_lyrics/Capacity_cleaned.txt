Album: Capacity

// Pretty Things //

Matthew, please do not regret
With your silk in my hand
And your heart in my sweat as you're
Lighting the end of my last cigarette
I will warm you
Warm you

These things that lonely ones do
Baby, that's what I'm here for
I'll take care and make all your
Wishes come true
If you want to
Do you want to?

Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too

There is an meeting in my thighs
Where in thunder and lightning
Men are baptized in their anger and fighting
Their deceit and lies
I've got lips like sugar
Lips like sugar

Holding my wrist to the bed
He was thrusting and moaning
And pressing his head
To my temple
His head was a temple
I said you've got lips like sugar, daddy
Lips like sugar

Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too
And she don't always do
Pretty things

// Shark Smile //

She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole a glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam

And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with a part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail
Ooh the guardrail
Ooh the guardrail

She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

// Capacity //

Flight is a beautiful word
Flowered with consonance
That's what I'll follow
Forever
I am a beautiful bird
Fluttered and floating
Swollen and hollowed
For heaven

Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

Slipping away from the party
Totally vacant
Everyone gone from their bodies
You were outside kissing another
She was a friend of mine
I was surprised to discover
I wrapped my arms around her
She was a beautiful figure

There are no enemies
We're make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

There is a castle that stands
High in the canyon
The blue knights are crying together
A child is holding my hand
She is directing, the red crystal pine with a feather

Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on
Really hanging on
Really hanging on

// Watering //

He followed me home again
And his eyes were watering
His eyes were watering
Like a child

I made-believe for him
That my blood was dripping
My blood was dripping into
His mouth

Screaming
Screaming

He cut off my oxygen
And my eyes were watering
As he tore into my skin
Like a lion

I knew it was poison
As he filled me to the brim
And my blood was dripping
Like a lamb

Screaming
Screaming
Screaming

Leave your bedroom light on
I live to watch you undress
And you know that I'm there
As you soak in my stare
With your right arm

Come to me
Come to me
Come
Come to me

// Coma //

He put her in
To get out
To get out
He kissed her skin
To get off
To get off
Off

You can wake up now, momma
From your protective coma
When you wake up
You wake up

You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house

// Great White Shark //

Mercury
Creeping on the sea
How she wails
Flails her arms and weeps
Accumulation of debris
Lips apart
Flapping as a lark
For in the dark there is release

Every familiarity scarce as the great white shark

Oh, to build
Walls with golden gills
Spike in hand
High above the sand
To kill the sanctuary

Every mile that is owned
Only stands still by the grace of the stone

Every familiarity scares as the great white shark

Look, daughter and owl
Listen to her howl
I howled when you were born to me
And you're alive with a breath you can't see
Oh, by the grace of this dream

// Mythological Beauty //

You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you who's trying to raise a child in me

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend's knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought would love and take better care
I have an older brother I don't know
He could be anywhere

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag, soaking up blood with your eyes
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, "Don't let my baby die."

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

// Objects //

Oh, volcanoes melting
Love is overwhelming
Letting your insides out
Blind altercation
Open invitation
Breaking your guard down
Leaving the familiar
Air is getting chillier
Stepping outside your skin

No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me

Walking through your garden
Pulling up the garlic
Getting our hands dirty
Kissing on the vampire, kissing on the werewolf
We have no enemies

No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me

// Haley //

Just like that, she is
I mean
We are, we are gone
For good
For closing my eye
Too soon
Missed the room
Old magpie
It just passed me through

Oh, when it gets you down
When you get that notion
Anyway, you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

Just like how it used to be, Hayley
Kicking around, burying the letters we wrote
Oh, wondering what yours might've said to me
Mine went
There are the geese
Over the trail
We have the open road

And it gets you down
When you get that notion
Anyway, you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

Just like that, he is holding my hand
Redirect, rearrange, bringing the moon to land
Oh
And oh, and it gets you down
When you get that notion
Anyway, you walk around
Anywhere that you are goin'
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open
Just like that, he is holding my hand
Redirect, rearrange, bringing the moon to land
Oh
And oh, and it gets you down
When you get that notion
Anyway, you walk around
Anywhere that you are goin'
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

// Mary //

Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in a rose
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning
High and smiling
Cheap drink
Dark and violent
Full of butterflies
The violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush
The constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band
When April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round Mary in your famous story book

We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning
High and smiling
Cheap drink
Dark and violent
Full of butterflies
The violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush
The constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band
When April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round Mary in your famous story book

// Black Diamonds //

So much coming in
I do not know where to begin
I just follow the lead you're pulling
And I get lost in your trail
So much more to tell
You just ask me if I'm doing well
But I do not know what the hell
I just swallow hard

In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

So much you can see
Should I let you make a woman of me?
Should I let you take the mystery from me?
See the inside of my room at night?
Sometimes you will find
Things I do not know how to leave behind
I've been grappling with my mind
I've been stuck inside a jail

In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

The cold of winter warms my blood and he's hot
Like a bed of steel
He finds his peace of mind
In the rivers and the whip-poor-wills
I could follow close behind
And slowly disappear
But I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him

In his eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling

So much more to do
Come on, let me make a man outta you
I could gather you and you tell the truth
You could cry inside my arms
You could cry inside my arms like a child
You could cry
You could cry
