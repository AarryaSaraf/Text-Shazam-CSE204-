Album: PowerOfLove

// She Doesn't Mind //

For love, you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary, you compromise
Sometimes it's bittersweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep

You see, hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

My girl's love is right on time
Sweet and sweet and ever kind
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
And there wasn't anything I could do

But she is so forgiving
The one thing I know is
It's off her love I'm living

That girl's love is right on time
Sweeter than sweet and ever kind
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

And even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

When I go out to play
She doesn't mind if I'm a little bit late
She knows I think about her face
'Til I get home, 'til I get back home

What we gonna do tonight?
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside
So let's just love until we get things right
And waste a whole lotta time, I don't mind

She don't mind and I don't mind
She don't, don't
She don't, don't, she don't

I tell her the things she can't repeat
Makes her little heart just skip a beat
She blush a little bit and then I find
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

Even though our love is c'est si bon
Sometimes I like to be alone
Ring the girl on her private line
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

Go to work early, come back late
Outta my head, can't concentrate
Sometimes my love is a waste of time
But she doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

She's better ever than she used to be
Loving her is no mystery
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

When I call her in the middle of the day
She's busy at work but it's okay
Not too busy to give me time
She doesn't, she doesn't, she don't mind

// Power Of Love / Love Power //

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
Let the feelin' sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone you see
How much better the world could be
For them and for you, for me
With the power of love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
My-my-my-my-my-my
You've got to feel the power
Yeah, yeah

So listen up and you will hear it
A symphony from above, it's the power of love
So glad we've found it, now there's no way around it
Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love

// I'm Gonna Start Today //

I got up this morning
And without a word of warning
I knew for sure I had to change my way

Dusted my mind to clear it
My body and my spirit
But it's okay, I'm gonna start today, hey

Emotions disappearing
I call out but you're not here and
I question why I have this debt to pay

But I'll do my best believing
And I'll get that lovin' feeling
I mean to say, I'm gonna start today

Start today to turn this love around
I know for sure I'll never let you down, baby
'Cause no longer do I think, it's all in your mind

I get the point and I've got nothing but time
To be the way, I know I really should be
And find a way for love to rescue me, ooh

(I'm gonna start today)
Working on loving you better
(I'm gonna start today)
Working on leaving you never

(I'm gonna start today)
So baby, dry your tears away, it's okay
  (I'm gonna start today, yeah, yeah)

Still dream of you returning
My pilot light is burning
I mention you every time that I pray

And I sleep with one eye open
'Cause in my heart I'm hoping
You'll believe what I say
I'm gonna start today, baby

And from this moment on
Even though, you'll be gone
I'm gonna do everything that I say

I wanna be your best man
I'll let time do the rest
And I'll sweep you away
I'm gonna start today

I am here but since your love is gone
The days are lonely and the nights are long, baby
'Cause I want that love I knew, no less or more

I want you back the way you loved me before
'Cause yesterday is how tomorrow should be
I'll start today if you will rescue me

Ooh, the night's so long, so long without you baby
And I can't stand it no more, anymore
Come here 'cause I want to prove my love for you, baby
Come back, this is where you belong

(I'm gonna start today)
Working on it, love has the power
(I'm gonna start today)
I'm working on it every, every, every hour

(I'm gonna start today)
So baby, dry those tears away, it's okay
  (I'm gonna start today)

Start today to turn this love around
I know for sure I'll never let you down, baby
'Cause no longer do I think it's all in your mind

I get the point and I've got nothing but time
To be the way, I know I really should be
And find a way for love to rescue me

Now, I know how to make love real
You don't know how, 'til you know how to feel
I've been picking up the pieces of my broken past
But it's okay, your baby's gonna start today

(I'm gonna start today)
Working on loving you better
(I'm gonna start today)
Working on leaving you never

(I'm gonna start today)
So baby, dry your tears away, it's okay
  (I'm gonna start today)

(I'm gonna start today)
Ooh, yeah, love has the power
(I'm gonna start today)
I'm working on it every, every, every hour

(I'm gonna start today)
So baby, dry those tears away, it's okay
  (I'm gonna start today)

(I'm gonna start today)
Working on loving you, yes I am
(I'm gonna start today)
You are one of a kind, you've made up my mind

(I'm gonna start today)
Baby, dry your tears away
  (I'm gonna start today)

I'm gonna start today
I'm gonna start today
I'm gonna start today

// The Rush //

Oh, what happened?
You know when love comes
It seems you're never ready
That's why they call it the rush

Running right through my head
... (The rush)

Tell me, tell me are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer?
See, I've prayed for peace and love like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you, yeah

Up in the morning, fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be, this is scaring me
(The rush)

It seems every time I try to rest my heart is when
The rush is back again
Maybe this time I'll make it work somehow
Guess, I'm gonna find out now

I get a rush and it's love for sure
What else can it be? Something beckons me and I go back for more
Oh, such a rush, running right through my head, can't pass love by
What else can I do? Something tells me to give it one more try, yeah

I'm not gonna die if love passes me by
It goes and comes around, I know
So maybe the next time, I'll be one of the few
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do

I will carry on wading through every day 'til love needs me
Waiting for the rush to come and find me
I can forget back when love was an angel sent
It will be back again

I don't remember when, I can't remember how
It's very different now
It ain't a fantasy, it's very real to me
True to the touch, I get a rush

I get a rush and it's love for sure
What else can it be? Something's calling me and I go back for more
Yeah yeah
It's such a rush, running right through my head, can't pass love by

// I Want The Night To Stay //

In your arms
In your arms, yeah

I dream enough to know
The way true love should feel
I'm strong enough to show you
The heart can always heal

It shouldn't be so hard
To let our love just live
It's really all we have
The love we need to give

I've been dreaming
I don't wanna be awake
I don't wanna see the day
I just want the night to stay

I want the night to stay
And last a little longer
So we can always be
In love you see

I want the night to stay
In your arms
In your arms, yeah

Tomorrow's gonna come
And chase tonight away
And leave me sitting right here
To cry the day away

I've been hoping
That tomorrow won't rush in
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want the night to end

I want the night to stay
And last a little longer
So we can always be
In love you see
I want the night to stay

Forever, together
Forever, together
Forever, together
Forever, together

In your arms, yeah
All night
Tonight
Good night
I want the night to stay
I want the night to stay

I want the night to
I'll stay right here in your arms
Right here in your arms
I want the night to stay, stay

I'll stay, oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna stay
Tonight, tonight
I wanna stay
I'll stay

// Don't Want To Be A Fool //

Love, what have you done, oh wow
I was sure up till now
That she was a friend
I stayed till the end

I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said, I'm a bore
My heart hit the floor

Each time around I tell myself
"It's the game of love"
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it till the end I just don't wanna be a fool
Said, "I don't wanna be a fool ever again"

Whenever a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same

He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart every time
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change

Oh, next time around I'll tell myself
"It'll be better than before"
I won't look back, there'll be no one
Tearing my heart out anymore, my baby
I've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear till the end I just don't wanna be a fool
Said, "I don't wanna be a fool ever again"

I mean no more
Ooh, no never
Can't be, no way
No way, no way
Ooh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool, no

I can't love anybody walking on a one way street
If I don't find somebody that'll be alright with me
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say it till the end, "I just don't wanna be a fool"
Said, "I don't wanna be a fool never, never again"

Can't be a fool never again
Never, never, never again
Can't be a fool

// I Can Tell You That //

(Talk about love, talk about love)
(Talk about love, talk about love)
Love, love, love
(Talk about love, talk about love)
Alright, love, love, love
(Talk about love, talk about love)

One day I'll always remember
Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close

So tender, it gave my heart
The second chance that I'd been waiting for

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey
Come on, open the door

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)

Every time that we kiss
I'm reminded it's you I miss
I just love it when we love like this
I can tell you that

Please forgive me if I pout
But my world would turn inside out
If on leaving me, you insist
Let me tell you that

I start to hold you but you pull back
Not much just a little, I can't control you
When you get so caught up in the middle
First you say yes, then you say no

Said, you're gonna stay
Now you're gonna go
You know I'll tell you, honey
But I think you already know

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)

I can you this, anytime you go
I really miss you, nothing to do
Tired of my friends, won't you come back
And love me again, so I can tell you
That you've got me forever girl to love

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey
Come on, open the door

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)

// Sometimes It's Only Love //

I am still your friend
Standin' by to catch you
If ever life should let you down
And you should fall

You don't need to pretend
If ever doubt should find you
I don't need to remind you
I'm there for you before and after all

I am who I am
And I would never fool you
I feel the same way you do
About honesty

But do we understand
How love is sometimes jaded
It keeps us separated
Even though we'll never part

So to be lovers
We've got to understand
Today is how today begins
Tomorrow's how it ends

And to be lovers
Some things we rise above
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful
But sometimes it's only love

Loving who I am
Is something that you've taught me
The kind of love you've brought me
Takes me through the day

And even though our minds
Are sometimes disagreeing
Our hearts they're still believing
We'll work it out and stay

So to be lovers
We've got to understand
Today is how today begins
Tomorrow's how it ends

And to be lovers
Some things we rise above
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful
But sometimes it's only love

I knew that one day
It would be only love
It would be only
It would be only love

I knew that in time
It would be only love
It would be only love

And to be lovers
We've got to understand
Today is how today begins
Tomorrow's how it ends

And to be lovers
Some things we rise above
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful
But sometimes it's only love

I knew that one day
It would be only love
It would be only
It would be only love

'Cause sometimes love is wonderful
But sometimes it's only love

// Emotional Love //

I think love should be heaven sent
I can't love you just to pay your rent

Heart to heart is the way it should be
You've got to love with devotion to emotion
Don't hold back, talk to me, let it go
Cry on my shoulder, honey, don't you know

If it's going to be an
(Emotional love)
Then it's got to start with a
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny
(I'm an emotional guy)
And I searched the world for a
(Emotional girl)

Happy to be the love of your life
'Cause some guys want ya for only one night

Can't explain all this love that I feel
Sometimes my mind is a ball of confusion
Love will fix it eventually
Don't tell your friends about it, come to me

If it's going to be
(Emotional love)
Then it's got to start with an
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny
(I'm an emotional guy)
So I searched the world for a
(Emotional girl)
Yes, I do

I like emotional
(Love)
I love emotional
(Love)

Don't hold on
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Can't explain all this love that I feel
Sometimes my mind is a ball of confusion
Love will fix it eventually
Don't tell your friends about it, come to me

If it's going to be

Then it's got to start with an
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny

Come down around
(Loves to be emotional)
If I say one thing about
(Got to be emotional)
Do you really love me but?
(Loves to be emotional)
Now I don't want to think about
(Got to be emotional)
And the one who can deny it
(Loves to be emotional)

// I (Who Have Nothing) //

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so

I'm just a no one
With nothing to give you
But ooh, I love you

She, she buys you diamonds
Say they're bright, they are bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me, boy, ooo boy, hear what I say

She could give you the world
But she'll never love you the way
That I love you, baby

You can go any place you want
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with her

My nose pressed up against the window pane
The window pane
Ooo yeah, yeah

I
Who have nothing
Nothing
I
Who have no one
Must watch you

I will watch you, baby
Go passing by
But you don't see me
Wrapped in the arms of
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else

When darling, it's I
Who
Really loves you, baby
Really loves you, baby

I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one

I want to be the one that you just can't live without
I want to be the one that you never feel no doubt
I want to be the one that you let give you the lovin'
But, I have nothing
Nothing

I want to be the one that you always want to be near
I want to say the words that your body and soul need to hear
I want to be the one that you let give you all the lovin'
But I have nothing

I want to be the one that you always want to be near
I want to say the words that your body and soul need to hear
I want to be the one that you let give you all the lovin'
But I have nothing
