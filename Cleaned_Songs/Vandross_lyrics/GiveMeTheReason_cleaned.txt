// See Me //

Yesterday was the first time
That I didn't hear from you
Almost felt like the world had ended
What was I to do

[Channel 1:]
You're the one for me
And only you can be my love fantasy
You lift me up higher, you're who I desire
I just love what you do to me
Don't leave me waiting too long
Come by and...

[Chorus:]
See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
Hurry baby

I can't hide my emotions
It never turns out right
And without you there was no one
To get me through the night
Well, I had never cried so much
For anybody else's touch
I even scared myself
What a way to spend my time
Hopin' for even one line
From you and no one else

[Channel 2:]
I really need you here with me
Seem, all these lonely nights keep
Messin' with my mind
I'm so satisfied I asked you to come on by 'cause
I know soon you'll be by my side
And, oh you won't keep me waiting too long
When you come by to...

[Chorus]

// I Gave It Up (When I Fell In Love) //

My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

[Chorus:]
See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love
I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when I fell in love

I thought I was justified
To only see the world through my eyes
And that it was a waste of time talkin' 'bout love
But it only took a little time to make change my mind
'Cause when she said goodbye
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Now, every night I dream about you and our new love
All of my friends say I'm such a different guy
And they wonder
Oh, how they wonder

Ad lib
I gave it up
Sho' nuff gave it up
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love

// Because It's Really Love //

I used to be afraid
That you were never gonna love me this way
But I feel better now
No one could ever say
To me, It's such a shame you're a lonely guy
Because you love is mine
And now we know our love is ever so true
I think we know it 'cause you feel the way I do
I can't imagine me without you, my dear
And I'm so glad about the reaon that you came here

[Chorus:]
Because it's love
Because it's love
Because it's really love
Because it's love
Because it's all the way love
Because it's really love

Ooo, girl you gotta stay
'Cause I wanna fill you day with happiness
'Cause I'm in love you see
There's so much I wanna say
And you'll hear the words to make you fall in love
Deep in love with me
I used to say I love you every day
To make you really know
To trust in the things I say
But look at me now and you can clearly see
The love I feel for you
You don't need words from me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
When you walked into the crowded room
You sent my rocket to the moon
But little did I know that you would change my life
But you kept saying take it slow
I love you for the things you know

'Cause now I'll never spend another lonely night... at night

I wanna be your friend
After the lovin' ends
It's not over then
You see it just begins
And all anyone can say
Is, Ooo wee you've got it made
And may the best of love
Always come your way
And I don't worry how much I fall
When the feelin' starts to call
Because it's really love
And all my worries fall into place
When I think about your face
Because it's really love

// Anyone Who Had A Heart //

Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away
I always say it's good bye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you

Anywone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And always love me, love me
Then why won't you

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one
