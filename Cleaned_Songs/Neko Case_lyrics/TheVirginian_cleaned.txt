// Timber //

My love was like a seed that you had planted

The root was not as strong as it could be

And as the years went on, you weren't enchanted

So you fell it like a great big tree


Now I'm falling timber

Timber the falling tree....


My heart was not a thing to take for granted

So loosen up your home and let me be

And if I had my way you would be planted

Drowning in the shade with me.


Now I'm calling timber...

Timber the falling tree-heeee.

// Bowling Green //

Way down in Bowlin' Green

Prettiest girls I've ever seen

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky

To love down in Bowlin' Green


Bowlin' Green folks treat you kind

They let you think your own mind

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky

In Bowlin' Green you walk your own line


Oh Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold

It warms the body and I know it touches the soul

Blue Grass is find, Kentucky owns my mind


The fields down in Bowlin' Green

Have the softest grass I've ever seen

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky

To lie down in Bowlin' Green, yeah


Bowlin' Green girls treat you right

They wear dresses cut country right

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky

If he's seen the Bowlin' Green light


Oh Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold

It warms the body and I know it touches the soul

Blue Grass is find, Kentucky owns my mind


Bowlin' Green, Bowlin' Green, Bowlin' Green...

Way down in Bowlin' Green

Yeah!

// Jettison //

I didn't let go 'cause you hurt me

I didn't let go so you'd stay

I did let you go 'cause I love you so much

And it kills me to see us this way


Love saved my life when you found me

A debt I can only repay

By closing the doors, now I'm savin' yours

And I know that you want it this way


Sandman take me much further than sleep

We'll ride down that river of tears

Where only the stars and the angels will weep

As I jettison all of my years


Long are the nights I lay cryin'

Wasn't because you weren't true

I hope you can finally be happy my love,

'Cause I'd give up my own life for you


Sandman take me much further than sleep

We'll ride down that river of tears

Where only the stars and the angels will weep

As I jettison all of my years

Oh, I jettsion all of my years

Oh, I jettison all of my years

// High On Cruel //

I shine like the sun

I'm on fire right now

Your tears have come too late

You break down the door

There's already nothing

I've only one heart to take

I've got all of what you're crying for now

Your tears have come too late

You break down the door

There's already nothing

I'd only one heart to break

You're crawling on the floor like a fool

And I'm so high on cruel

You'll drown in the light

And I'll burn like a star

Your tears are gonna give me fuel


Pray that your happy

And the years they fall away

Well, I've learned a lesson

So don't ask me to stay...

// Karoline //

Oh, the path you walk is on fire,

So wild and unashamed

With a passion you inspire

I'm gonna keep those men at bay


Cowgirl you've got that something

Of what all my dreams are made

So come on baby, just say the word,

I wanna be your slave


Yooooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooooo.....


Oh the web you weave is so tender

I'm tangled by your gaze

And you know I need surrender

I never locked you in a cage


Cowgirl I've got that loving that puts all those men to shame

So come on baby, just say you will

Don't lay me in my grave


Yooooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooooo.....


Oh, the path you walk is on fire,

So wild and unashamed

With a passion you inspire

I'm gonna keep those men at bay


Cowgirl you've got that something

Of what all my dreams are made

So come on baby, just say the word,

I wanna be your slave


Yooooooooooooooooooooooo

Oh, miss Karoline

// Lonely Old Lies //

Sittin' here lost in my senses

Drownin' in old memories

Brought down from on high

When you said goodbye

Seems all that I lived for were lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Mind's all tied up with wild senses

It's not how I thought love would be

My heart from inside

Has burst open wide

Seems all that that have lived there were lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned

In you


Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned

Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Lies, lies, lies...

// Honky Tonk Hiccups //

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


When I got home from work

I was feeling pretty fine

'Til I started getting hiccups 'round suppertime

Held my breath 'til I hit the floor

But the hiccups kept coming

Even more more more


I asked my baby to stand up on a chair

And when I wasn't looking

She would give me a scare

I drank a glass of water

And I blew into a bag

But the hiccups kept a-comin

A nag nag nag


I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


Well I was feeling low

But my baby made me go

Down to the honky tonk and hillbilly show

An hour in the line-up

And I finally made the door

But the hiccups kept a-coming

Even more more more


First I heard the music

And then I felt a beat

And that's when I knew

That the hiccups would retreat

I headed for the dance floor

I really did my best

I did The Rump Jump

I guess the whiskey did the rest


I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor

I found the cure on the hardwood floor

The only cure is the hardwood floor

(Hic!)

// The Virginian //

When I was young, I knew a girl

Who wouldn't love god as a test

Or gamble with her happiness

And so led astray


So she did turn

Her father would say,

'You're only a guest of the master'


But passion was her sunday best

And she fell away

She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na


When she grew up, she fell in love

She thought it was all that she wanted

She knew how it felt to be haunted

And he ran away


Picked herself up

And said through her tears

Don't waste anymore of your time

You'll spend it all standing in line

They'll turn you away


She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na


Oh but superstition

And your heart's permission

'Cause you're good enough, good enough, good enough

To make it alone


Then when she died

She didn't ask god

To take her back into his graces

She'd taken on to many shapes

And too many were strange


And as they lay her in to the ground

Her spirits, they all flew all away

The sun shone so bright on that day

You thought it was spring


She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na

// Duchess //

It's your bicycle bells
And your Rembrandt swells
You're children like
And still breathing
It's your look of loss
When you're coming across
Makes me feel like a thief
When you're bleeding

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess
Put all the love back in me

It's the Persian sea
Running through your veins
You shed your names
With the seasons
Still they all return
With there last remains
As they lay them before you
Like breezes

It's your shimmering dress
It says no
It says yes
It says I've nothing left for concealing
It's your shapeless flesh
And your old girl's grace
It's your young girl's face
That I'm breathing

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess
Put all the love back in me

I'm lying
She's crying

// Thanks A Lot //

Thanks

Thanks a lot

I got a broken heart

That's all I've got

You made me cry

Now I cried a lot

I lost your love baby

Thanks a lot


You told our friend

As I was passin' by

That you're not sorry

That you made me cry

You said I deserve

Just what I got

Well if that's how you feel babe

Thanks a lot

Thanks

Thanks a lot

I got a broken heart

That's all I've got You made me cry

Now I cried a lot

I lost your love baby

Honey, thanks a lot


You wanted a fool

& I played the part

Now all I've got is a broken heart

We loved a little

& laughed a lot

Then you were gone

Honey thanks a lot

Thanks

Thanks a lot...

// Somebody Led Me Away //

You'll come in with the sun in the mornin'

Like you've done so often before

But you won't find me asleep on the sofa

Exhausted from walkin' the floor


'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

My heart was slippin' away

'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

Somebody led me away


And this time the note on your pillow

Will go a lot more than "I'm through"

For the guilt I'm feeling this time over leaving

Is that it's so easy to do


'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

My heart was slippin' away

'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

Somebody led me away

// Misfire //

Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on.
Don't you know honey that love's a game.
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim.
Gotta hold on tight,
Shoot me out of sight.
Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded and pointed my way
There's only one bullet so don't delay
Gotta time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on, take your shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire.
