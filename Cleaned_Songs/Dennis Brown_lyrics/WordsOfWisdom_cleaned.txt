// Cassandra //

I can't believe that it's real
The way that she makes me feel
Its something deep down inside
Oh it's a feeling I just cannot hide
She's never been unfaithful to me
So we will always be
She's never been unfaithful to me
As far as I can see
She gave me love in the morning and in the evening too
She gave me love in when I'm lonely so I never felt blue
So ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on
Ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on

// Love Jah //

I was appointed, to say this
My love, is mercy
Accept it for what it's worth
My love, is pure and true
I'll never lead you astray

Jah love, is merciful
Reaching out for this world
This love, is everlasting
Shining bright as a morning star

So in your time of desperation
You won't be despised or even be trampled on, no
If only you'd given him, your heart and soul
Frustration, depression, confusion, you'll overcome

Jah, love is everlasting, yeah
It's reaching out for the world
His love, is pure and true
Shining bright as a morning star

Yes in your time of temptation
Don't let the devil, lead you to destruction, no
Just let you heart be pure and true
And you'll have endless days, awaiting you

Oh yeah, now, now
Oh yeah

Yes in your time of desperation
You won't be despised, or even be trampled on, no
If only you'd given him, your heart and soul
Frustration, depression, confusion, you'll overcome

Jah love, is everlasting, yeah
It's reaching out for the world
My love, is pure and true
I'll never lead you astray

Jah love, is merciful
Shining bright as a morning star
His love, is everlasting, yeah. I'll never lead you astray

// So Jah Say //

Oh yeh
So Jah say
I must not let him down
I must not let him down

'Cause if I do
I'm gonna have to pay
If I do I'm gonna have to pay
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
Let him down
So Jah say
I must not let him down
Let him down
No matter where you run
To for rescue this day
He's gonna find you anyway
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
No let him down

To fear of the Lord
Is to hate evil
Pride and arrogancy, oh
And the evil way
So Jah say
I said the fear of the Lord
Is to hate evil
Pride and arrogancy, oh
And the evil way
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
Let him down

Not one of his seed
Shall sit on the sidewalk and beg bread
There'll never be, there'll never be
Not one of his seed
Shall be a living dead

// Don't Feel No Way //

Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play

Oh mister D.J. music is
The love of my life
If the day should ever come
When music stop playing
I don't want to be around

So don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play

When I'm feeling
Down and out
Music is my only relief
And if you can't dig the score
Come on and brutalise my very soul
Don't feel no way
Feel no way

Oh loving music
Without you in my life
Love wouldn't worth a dime
And oh its such a crime
Love you in the morning
I love you in the evening too
I love you right next to the
Almighty one

Mister music
Let Jah music play
Hit me with music
You know I can't refuse it

Don't feel no way

// Words Of Wisdom //

Whoa! Whoa yeah nah
I will open my mouth in a parable, and sing the dark sayings of old
And much wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
Unto you, o children, I cry

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Ooh, ooh, whoa yeah yeah nah nah, oh yeah. Ooh, woah yeah

In laughter the heart is sorrowful
Your folly is your reward
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than feasting where there is wrath

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Whoa yeah now now... Whoa... yeah! Ooh ooh yeah... oh yeah now

So take heed Jah-people, and live upright, for this is the time that will tell
When the righteous ones shall stand up strong
Oh why did the heathen rage?

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Whoa yeah now... mmm... Oh yeah, said you will surely fail! Oh yeah now... mmm... Oh yeah now

So I will open my mouth in a parable, and sing the dark sayings of old
So much wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
