// Easy Life //

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
I'm asking a question
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me? Lord

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me, woo
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury

There are two roads before you
And you've gotta make a choice
Would you give up your prince for this pauper
Would you make that sacrifice?
Girl, you know that I treat you good
And you're well looked after
I've given you an easy life
Filled with fun and laughter

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
I'm asking a question
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury? Yeah-a
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury

Be careful when you make your decision
Remember I'm a man on a mission
What I start I just don't quit
Are you ready for that relationship?
I offer you no bed of roses
I'm a man of simple means
Here's my heart - you can have it
And everything you'll ever need, yeah

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury

There are two roads before you
And you've gotta make a choice
Would you give up your prince for this pauper
Would you make that sacrifice?
Girl, you know that I treat you good
And you're well looked after
I've given you an easy life
Filled with fun and laughter

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me - answer me question
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury - I wanna know
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me, ooeh
Would you give up the easy life and your luxury, yeah-a
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me
Would you give up the easy life and your luxury, mmm
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me, ooh woo
Give up the easy life and the luxury, yeah-a
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me
Give up the easy life and the luxury
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me

// Jealousy //

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

What a man has, is his own business
It didn't come easy
Blood, sweat and tears, throughout the years
Satisfy, don't be greedy
All you watching and peeping
Envying another man's wealth
Instead of sit and criticizing
Try a little thing for yourself

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh whoa
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

If you mess with your family
Even my girl and me
Best friends turn worst enemies
All because of jealousy

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, yeah
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

What a man has, is his own business
It didn't come easy
Blood, sweat and tears, throughout the years
Satisfy, don't be greedy
All you watching and peeping
Envying another man's wealth
Instead of sit and criticizing
Try a little thing for yourself

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh yeah
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

If you mess with your family
Even my girl and me
Best friends turn worst enemies
All because of jealousy

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh whoa
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, oh Lord

(Jealousy, jealousy) All because of jealousy, yeah
Will bring disunity, yeah (jealousy, jealousy)
Even with your family, wooy (jealousy, jealousy)
Red eye and envy (jealousy, jealousy)
Don't be greedy, no (jealousy, jealousy)
Jealousy, jealousy...

// Love Me Or Leave Me //

A won't you love me, hmm? Yes I do

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me, but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm

You're my only pride and joy, hmm
And you said I was your favourite toy, Lord
You're my heaven on earth, Lord knows
But it seems you wanna diss me dirt

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me
Love me or leave me, girl

I gave you my whole heart with ease, Lord knows
Didn't know you was so hard to please
And you don't think you'd ask me to
Now I wanna hear the truth from you, oh

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl

Hmm...

Tell me, and I will understand, Lord knows
If you have found another man, Lord
I wanna know, what it's all about, yeah
So we can sit down and work it out, Lord

Love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Love me or leave me, girl, hmm
I want you to love me, even to leave me
But please don't deceive me, girl

Love, love, love me or leave me - but don't deceive me
Don't you, don't you - love me or leave me
I want you to love - love me or leave me
But don't deceive me - don't you, don't you, don't
Love me or leave me
