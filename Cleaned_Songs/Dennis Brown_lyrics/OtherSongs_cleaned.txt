// Angel In Disguise //

How do you feel
Knowing you're like a meal deal, eh
Your lips are surreal
As if of cherrylade, oh-oh-oh
Your words are softly spoken, yeah-yes
And you seem to be a very nice person, yeah

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
With nature that can never go cold
My happiness lies in you
With everything that is blind so true

Angel in disguise, you're my
Angel in disguise, yes, yeah

What are your fancies?
Are they far reaching?
Or even moreso appealing, yeah
Tell me something
Could you be coming? Yeah
Through a world of emptiness, ah yeah, eh

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
Let the truth be unfold, eh
And stay in the air, ooh, can you?
I'm so amazed, I'm even dazed

Angel in disguise, oh
You're my angel in disguise, yeah, nah
Whoa-oh-oh, oh nah, oh yeah
You're my angel in disguise, yes, eh

How do you feel
Knowing you're like a meal deal, eh
Your lips are surreal
As if of cherrylade, oh yeah

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
Let the truth be unfold
Am standing here looking at you
I'm so amazed, I'm even dazed

Angel in disguise, oh
You're my angel in disguise, yes
You're my angel in disguise, oh, yeah
My angel in disguise

// Baby Don't Do It //

Now I know that you're not smart
How you said goodbye and love yourself
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart

Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance

Now I know you know you're mistake
And you'll never try to hurt yourself again
'Cause you have done me no wrong
Baby, can't you understand

Don't you ever try to hurt yourself anymore
Oh girl, don't you try to hurt yourself anymore

Hello, my baby, oh yeah
Baby, don't do it, yeah

Now I know that you're not wise
Look how you made yourself look sad
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart

Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance

Baby, don't do it
Oh, oh, babe, baby, don't you do it
Baby, don't do it

Oh, oh, oh baby, don't do it
Oh, babe, baby, don't you do it
Ooh, whoo

// Deceiving Girl //

Oh yeah, woah-oy, woah-oy yeah, hey

You really had me believing
That you were true
And I didn't need conviction
I was so in love with you

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, woah-oh, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

Now, we had a good thing going
You said so yourself
But you were only deceiving
'Cause you love someone else

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah-oh, why, why, why

Now, you really had me believing
That you were true
And I didn't need conviction
I was so in love with you

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no-no, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, let me down

Now, we had a good thing going
You said so yourself
But you were only deceiving
'Cause you love someone else

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

// Dock Of The Bay //

Well, well, well, yeah - oooh

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' till the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in, yea!
Then I watch 'em roll away again, Lord

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

I left my home in Jamaica
Headed for London town
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way

Lord, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same, woo
I can't do what some people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, Lord!

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yea
Three thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this London my home

Lord, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Just to make this London my home, Lord
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

// Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend //

Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you weren't at home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
But I heard laughter coming through your door
Sometimes late at nights, you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep (Yeah)
You make me a vow to try and stop by sometimes
But baby, that's a promise I can't keep

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Oh, why

You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way, you take my hand and then
Introduce me to your latest lover
That's when I feel the wall starts crashing in

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh
I love-love-love you too much (Yeah)

// Equal Rights //

Every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Treat him right, Lord, and oh, treat him good
Take a tip from me, don't hang him on a tree
We should never give against another man

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Remember how we're all one flesh and blood
Keep your brother up, don't push him in the mud
We should never give against another man (No, no-no)

Every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Treat him right, Lord, and oh, treat him good
Take a tip from me, don't hang him on a tree
We should never give against another man (No)

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Remember how we're all one flesh and blood
Lift your brother up, don't push him in the mud
We should never give against another man (No)

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be
