// Song For David //

And the little one in my arms will sleep
Every rising of the moon makes the years grow late
And the love in our hearts will keep

There are friends I will make and bonds I will break
As the seasons roll by and we build our own sky
In my heart I will wait by the stony gate
And the little one in my arms will sleep

And the stars in your sky are the stars in mine
And both prisoners of this life are we
Through the same troubled waters we carry our time
You and the convicts and me

There's a good thing to know on the outside or in
To answer not where but just who I am
Because the stars in your sky are the stars in mine
And both prisoners of this life are we

The hills that you know will remain for you
And the little willow green will stand firm
The flowers that we planted through the seasons past
Will all bloom on the day you return

To a baby at play all a mother can say
He'll return on the wind to our hearts and till then
I will sit and I'll wait by the stony gate
And the little one 'neath the trees will dance

And the little one in my arms will sleep
Every rising of the moon makes the years grow late

// Sons Of //

Sons of the sea, sons of the saint
Who is the child with no complaint
Sons of the great or sons unknown
All were children like your own

The same sweet smiles, the same sad tears
The cries at night, the nightmare fears
Sons of the great, sons unknown
All were children like your own

Sons of tycoons, or sons from the farms
All of the children ran from your arms
Through fields of gold, through fields of ruin
All of the children vanished too soon

In towering waves, in walls of flesh
Amid dying birds trembling with death
Sons of tycoons, sons from the farms
All of the children ran from your arms

Sons of your sons, sons passing by
Children were lost in lullaby
Sons of true love, sons of regret
All of your sons you can never forget

Some build the roads, some wrote the poems
Some went to war, some never came home
Sons of your sons, sons passing by
Children were lost in lullaby

// The Patriot Game //

Come all ye young rebels, and list while I sing,
For the love of one's country is a terrible thing.
It banishes fear with the speed of a flame,
And it makes us all part of the patriot game.

My name is O'Hanlon, and I've just turned sixteen.
My home is in Monaghan, and where I was weaned
I learned all my life cruel England's to blame,
So now I am part of the patriot game.

It's nearly two years since I wandered away
With the local battalion of the bold IRA,
For I read of our heroes, and wanted the same
To play out my part in the patriot game.

This Ireland of ours has too long been half free.
Six counties lie under John Bull's tyranny.
But most of our leaders are greatly to blame
For shirking his part in the Patriot game.

They told me how Connolly was shot in his chair,
The wounds from his battle all bleeding and bare.
His fine body twisted, all battered and lame
They soon made me part of the patriot game.

And now I am dying, my body all holes
I think of those traitors who bargained ones soul
I'm sorry my rifle had not done the same
To traitors who sold out the patriot's game.

// Prothalamium //

Come, all of you who are not satisfied
As rulers in a lone wallpapered room
Full of mute birds and flowers that falsely bloom
And closets choked with dreams that long ago died

Come, let us sweep the old streets like a bride
Sweep out the dead leaves with a relentless broom
Prepare for spring as if he were our groom
For whose light footstep eagerly we bide

We'll sweep out the shadows, where the rats long fed
Sweep out our shame and in its place we'll make
A bower for love, a splendid marriage bed
Fragrant with flowers a quiver for the spring

And when he comes, our murdered dreams shall wake
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing

// Oh, Had I A Golden Thread //

Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I would weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design, of rainbow design

In it I'd weave the bravery
Of women giving birth
And in it I would weave the innocence
Of children of all the earth, children of all the earth

Show my brothers and sisters my rainbow design
I would bind up this sorry world
With hand and my heart and mind
Hand and heart and mind

Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I I would weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design, of rainbow design

// Farewell To Tarwathie //

Adieu Mormond Hill
And the dear land of Crimmond
I bid you farewell
I'm bound off for Greenland
And ready to sail
In hopes to find riches
In hunting the whale

Farewell to my comrades
For a while we must part
And likewise the dear lass
Who first won my heart
The cold coast of Greenland
My love will not chill
And the longer my absence
More loving she'll feel

Our ship is well rigged
And she's ready to sail
The crew they are anxious
To follow the whale
Where the icebergs do float
And the stormy winds blow
Where the land and the ocean
Is covered with snow

The cold coast of Greenland
Is barren and bare
No seed time nor harvest
Is ever known there
And the birds here sing sweetly
In mountain and dale
But there's no bird in Greenland
To sing to the whale

There is no habitation
For a man to live there
And the king of that country
Is the fierce Greenland bear
And there'll be no temptation
To tarry long there
With our ship bumper full
We will homeward repair

Farewell to Tarwathie
Adieu Mormond Hill
And the dear land of Crimmond
I bid you farewell
We're bound off for Greenland
And ready to sail
In hopes to find riches
In hunting the whale

// Time Passes Slowly //

Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
And catch the wild fishes that swim in the streams
Time passes slow when you're lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart, he was fine and good lookin'
We sat in the kitchen while my mama was cookin'
And stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slow when you're searchin' for love

Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like a cloud that passes and covers the day
Time passes slow and then fades away

// Nightingale I //

Jacob's heart bent with fear
Like a bow with death for its arrow
In Vain he search for the final truth
To set his soul free of doubt

Over the mountains he walked
With his head bent searching for reasons
Then he called out to God
For help and climbed to the top of a hill

Wind swept the sunlight through the wheat fields
In the orchard the nightingale sang
While the plums that she broke with her brown beak
Tomorrow would turn in to songs

Then she flew up through the rain
With the sun silver bright on her feathers
Jacob put back his frowns and sighed and walked
Back down the hill

God doesn't answer me and
He never will

// Nightingale II //

Jacob's heart bent with fear,
Like a bow with death for its arrow,
In Vain he search for the final truth
To set his soul free of doubt.

Over the mountains he walked,
With his head bent searching for reasons,
Then he called out to God
For help and climbed to the top of a hill.

Wind swept the sunlight through the wheat fields,
In the orchard the nightingale sang,
While the plums that she broke with her brown beak,
Tomorrow would turn in to songs.

Then she flew up through the rain
With the sun silver bright on her feathers,
Jacob put back his frowns and sighed and walked 
Back down the hill.

God doesn't answer me and 
He never will.

// Simple Gifts //

'Tis the gift to be simple
'Tis the gift to be free
'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
It will be in the valley of love and delight

When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend, we will not be ashamed
To turn, turn, will be our delight
'Til by turning, turning, we come round right
