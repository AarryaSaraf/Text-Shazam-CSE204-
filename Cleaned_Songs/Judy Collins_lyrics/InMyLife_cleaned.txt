// Tom Thumb's Blues //

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outa you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

// Hard Lovin' Loser //

He's the kind of guy
Puts on a motorcycle jacket
And he weighs about
A hundred and five

He's the kind of surfer
Got a ho daddy haircut
And you wonder how
He'll ever survive

He's the kind of frogman
Wearing twenty pounds
Of counter weights and
Sinking in the sea like a stone

He's the kind of soldier
Got no sense of direction
And they send him
In the jungle alone

But when the
Frost's on the pumpkin
And the litle girls are jumping
He's a hard loving son of a gun

He's got em waiting downstairs
Just to sample his affairs
And they call him
A spoonful of fun

He's the kind of person
Going riding on a skateboard
And his mind's raging
Out of control

He's the kind of person
Goes to drive a Maserati
Puts his key inside
The wrong little hole

He's the kind of ski bum
Tearing wild down the mountain
Hits a patch where
There ain't any snow

He's the kind of cowboy
Got a hot trigger finger
Shoots his boot cause
He's drawing kind of slow

But when he comes in for bowling
He's an expert at rolling
Sets the pins up
And lays em right down

He's got em taking off their heels
And they like the way he feels
And they call him 
A carnival clown

Well, he's got a parachute
And screaming like Geronimo
And makes a little hole
In the ground

He's the kind of logger
When the man hollers, timber
Got to stop and look
Around for the sound

He's the kind of artist
Rents a groovy little attic
And discovers that he
Can't grow a beard

He's the human cannonball
Come in for a landing
And he wonders where
The net disappeared

But when he takes off his shoes
It won't come as news
That they're lining up
On threes and in twos

He's got em pounding on the door
Got em begging for some more
He's got em pounding on the door
Got em begging for some more
And they call him
Whatever they choose

// Pirate Jenny //

You gentlemen can watch while I'm scrubbin' the floor
And I'm scrubbin' the floor while you're gawking
And maybe once you tipped me and it made you feel swell
In a ratty waterfront in this ratty-old hotel

But you'll never know to who you're talkin'
You never know to who you're talkin'

Suddenly, one night, there's a scream in the night
And you yelled, "What the hell could that have been?"
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, "What's she got to grin?"

And the ship, a Black Freighter
With a skull on its masthead will be comin' in

Then you gentlemen can say, "Hey girl, finish the floors
Get upstairs, make the beds, earn your keep here
You toss me your tips and look out at the ships

But I'm countin' your heads
While I make up the beds
'Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here
Tonight, none of you will sleep here

Then, that night, there's a bang in the night
And you yelled, "Who's that kicking up a row?"
And ya see me kinda starin' out the window
And you say, "What's she got to stare at now?"

And the ship, the Black Freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from the bow

Then you gentlemen can wipe off the laugh from your face
Every building in town is a flat one
Your whole stinking place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standin' up safe and sound

And you ask, "Why did they spare that one?"
And you ask, "Why did they spare that one?"

All the night through, with the noise and to-do
You wonder, who's the person lives up there?
Then you see me steppin' out in the mornin'
Lookin' nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship, the Black Freighter
Runs the flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a' swarmin' with men
Comin' off of that ghostly freighter

And they're movin' in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And bringin' them to me

Askin' me
"Kill them now or later?"
Askin' me
"Kill them now, or later?"

Noon by the clock
And so still on the dock
You can hear the foghorn miles away

In that quiet of death
I'll say, "Right now
Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say, "That'll learn ya"

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Disappears out to sea
And on it is me

// Suzanne //

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength and lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll may be trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see Him
He said, "All men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them"
But He Himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you trust her
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

// La Colombe //

Why all these bugles crying
For squads of young men drilled
To kill and to be killed
And waiting by this train?
Why the orders loud and hoarse
Why the engine's groaning cough
As it strains to drag us off
Into the holocaust?
Why crowds who sing and cry
And shout and fling us flowers
And trade their right for ours
To murder and to die?

The dove has torn her wings
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

Why has this moment come
When childhood has to die
When hope shrinks to a sigh
And speech into a drum?
Why are they pale and still
Young boys trained overnight
Conscripts forced to fight
And dressed in gray to kill?
These rain clouds massing tight
This train load battle bound
This moving burial ground sent
Thundering toward the night

The dove has torn her wings
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

Why statues towering brave
Above the last defeat
Old word and lies repeat
Across the new made grave?
Why the same still birth
That victory always brought
These hoards of glory bought
By men with mouths of earth?
Dead ash without a spark
Where cities glittered bright
For guns probe every light
And crush it in the dark

The dove has torn her wings
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

And why your face undone
With jagged lines of tears
That gave in those first years
All peace I ever won?
Your body in the gloom
The platform fading back
Your shadow on the track
A flower on a tomb
And why these days ahead
When I must let you cry
And live prepared to die
As if our love were dead?

The dove has torn her wings
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

// Marat / Sade //

4 years after the revolution
And the old kings execution
4 years after remember how
Those portia took their final bow

String up every aristocrat
Out with the priests and let then live on their fat

Four years after we started fighting
Marat keeps up with his writing
Four years after the bastille fell
He still recalls the old battle yell

Down with all of the ruling class
Throw all the generals out on their ass

Why do they have the gold
Why do they have the power why why why why why
Do they have the friends at the top

Why do they have the jobs at the top

We've got nothing always had nothing
Nothing but holes and millions of them
Living in holes
Dying in holes
Holes in our bellies and
Holes in our clothes

Marat we're poor
And the poor stay poor
Marat don't make us wait any more
We want our rights and we don't care how
We want a revolution
Now

Four years he fought and he fought unafraid
Sniffing down traitors by traitors betrayed
Marat in the courtroom
Marat underground
Sometimes the otter and sometimes the hound

Fighting all the gentry and fighting every priest
The business man the bourgeois the military beast
Marat always ready to stifle every scheme
Of the sons of the ass licking dying regime

We've got new generals our leaders are new
They sit and they argue and all that they do
Is sell their own colleagues
And ride upon their backs
Or jail them
Or break them
Or give them all the ax
Screaming in language that no one understand
Of the rights that we grab with our own bleeding hands
When we wiped out the bosses
And stormed threw the wall of the prison you told us would outlast us all

Marat we're poor
And the poor stay poor
Marat don't make us wait any more.
We want our rights and we don't care how
We want a revolution
Now

Poor old marat they hunt you down
The bloodhounds are sniffing all over the town
Just yesterday your printing press was smashed
Now their asking your home address

Poor old Marat in you we trust
You work till your eyes turn as red a rust
But while you write their on your track
The boots mount the staircase
The doors thrown back

Poor old Marat in you we trust
You work till your eyes turn as red a rust
Poor old marat we trust in you

Marat we're poor
And the poor stay poor
Marat don't make us wait any more
We want our rights and we don't care how
We want a revolution
Now

// I Think It's Going To Rain Today //

Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

// Sunny Goodge Street //

On the firefly platform on sunny Goodge Street,
Violent ash smokers shook a chocolate machine.
Involved in an eating scene.
Smashing into neon lights in their stoners
Smearing their eyes on the crazy coke goddess
Listening to sounds
Of Mingus Mellow Fantastic.
"My, my," they sigh. 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

In dollhouse runes
with colored lights swinging
strange music boxes sadly tinkling.
Drinking the sun,
Shining all around you.
"My, my," they sigh. 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

The magician, he sparkles
in satin and velvet.
You gaze at his splendor
with eyes you've not used yet.
I tell you his name is:
Love love love
"My, my," they sigh 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

// Liverpool Lullaby //

Oh you are a mucky kid,
Dirty as a dustbin lid
When he finds out the things you did
You'll get a belt from your da
Oh you have your father's nose
So crimson in the dark, it glows
If you're not asleep when the boozers close
You'll get a belt from your da

You look so scruffy lying there
Strawberry jam tats in your hair
Though in the world you haven't a care
And I have got so many
It's quite a struggle everyday
Living on your father's pay
The bugger drinks it all away
And leaves me without any

Although we have no silver spoon
Better days are coming soon
Now Nellie's working at the loom
And she gets paid on Friday
Perhaps one day we'll have a splash
When Littlewoods provides the cash
We'll get a house in Knotty Ash
And buy your dad a brewery

Oh you are a mucky kid,
Dirty as a dustbin lid
When he finds out the things you did
You'll get a belt from your da
Oh you have your father's face
You're growing up a real hard case
But there's no one can take your place
Go fast asleep for Mammy

// Dress Rehearsal Rag //

Got up sometime in the afternoon
And you didn't feel like much
You said to yourself, "Where are you, golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?"

I thought you knew where
All the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory town

Look at your body now
Where there's nothing much to say
And a bitter voice in the mirror says
"Hey prince, you need a shave"

Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect
From the kind of places you've been living in?

Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision that is dim

Cover up your face with soap, there
Now, you're Santa Claus
And you've got an A for anyone
Who will give you his applause

I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you spent the summers
Picking all the berries that grew there

There were times she was a woman
There were times she was a child
As you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild

And you climbed the highest mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere you went
Love went along with you

That's a hard one to remember
It makes you clench your fist
And the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist

And yes, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
Wasn't it a strange way down?

You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are coupons you can send

Why don't you join the Rosicrucians?
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love in diagrams
In a plain, brown envelope

But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be tattooed on your arm
Along with several thousand dreams

Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mitt
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit

And then the cameras pan
The stand in stuntman's
Dress rehearsal rag

// In My Life //

There are places, I remember,
all my life though some have changed
some forever, not for better
some are gone, and some remain
all these places have their meanings
with lovers and friends I still can recall, 
some are dead and some are living...
in my life, I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers, 
there is no one compares with you. 
And these memories lose their meaning 
when I think of love of something new. 
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people 
and things that went before, 
I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life, I love you more.

Though I know I'll never lose affection for people 
and things that went before, 
I know I'll often stop and think about them. 
In my life, I love you more.
