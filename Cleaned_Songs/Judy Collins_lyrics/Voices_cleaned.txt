// Sailor's Life //

Oh, a sailor's life is a weary life
For he robs the girls of their delight
Causes them to weep, causes them to mourn
Loss of a true love, never to return

Oh, Father, Father, build me a boat
And on the world's oceans, I will float
Hail each captain, as I pass by
There, I'll ask for my sailor boy

Oh, captain, captain, tell me true
Does my own Willie sail with you?
Tell me soon, to give me joy
None will I have but my sailor boy

Oh no, kind lady, he's not here
He drowned in the gulf, and we buried him there
On the island, as we passed by
There, we left your sailor boy

Oh, she rung her hands, and tore her hair
Just like some lady in great despair
Called for a chair to sit her down
Penningdon for, to write it down

Oh, dig my grave wide and deep
Put a marble stone at the head and feet
On my grave, a turtle dove
Tell the world, I died for my love

Oh, a sailor's life is a weary life
He robs the girls of their delight
Causes them to weep, causes them to mourn
Loss of a true love, never to return

// Albatross //

The lady comes to the gate dressed in lavender and leather
Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard 
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly 
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone...with me.

// My Father //

My father always promised us
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats
We knew we would sail in time

All my sisters soon were gone
To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man

I stayed behind the youngest still
Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound

And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
Set in my father's eyes again

My father always promised us
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
Set in my father's eyes again
