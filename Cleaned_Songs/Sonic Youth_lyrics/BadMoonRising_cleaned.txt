// Brave Men Run (In My Family) //

[Kim]

Seven days and seven nights

I dreamt a sailor's dream at sea

Seven days and seven nights

I dreamt a sailor's dream of me

Seven days and siven nights

The world was made and lost again

Seven days and seven nights

Brave men run

In my family

Brave men run

Into the setting sun

Brave men run

Into captivity

Brave men run

In my family


Brave men run

Away from me

// Society Is A Hole //

[Thurston]

Society is a hole

It makes me lie to my friends

It's running down my street

With white powers sneakers

On the beautiful beat of black feet

Society is a hole

It beats my friends big heads

My friends have big heads,

I can understand it

But I don't recommend it

You got big big hair

And everybody is scared

Society is a hole

It makes me lie to my friends

The assault of holy music

There's a slap in my face

My friends are girls wrapped in boys

We're living in pieces

I want to live in peace

Society is a hole

[talking]

// I Love Her All The Time //

[Thurston]

She comes into my mind

Twisting thru my nerves

I don't understand

A word she says

She's on my side

I love her all the time

I love her all the time

I love her all the time

I love her all the time


She comes into my mind

Twisting thru my nerves

I don't understand

A word she says

She's on my side

I love her all the time

I love her all the time

I love her all the time

I love her all the time

// Ghost Bitch //

[Kim]

Slowly pour the liquid down

For miles and miles it flows along

Rose coloured neon lighted

Swirl around turn around

Feel the touch of my hand

Swirl around swirl around

Fellow shadows black and blue

All around all around

Locking arms side by side

Crouch down before the fire's light

You're the first day of my life


I had no belief before

Until I had this dream last night

I still remember their savage cries

So serious in their rite

Faces painted in joyous fright

In the dawns early light

Oh say did you see the colour of my eternity

And the sweat on my skin

Our founding fathers laid right down

And indian ghost from long ago

They gave birth to my bastard kin

America it is called

A sensation of eternity

Locking arms side by side

Crouch down before fire's light

You're the first day of my life

// I'm Insane //

[Thurston]

Love starved backwood teaser farm girl hot eyed bride

Stone cold blonde a quivering menace atomic wallop wholesale murder

We want out

We fish at night

Sex in heaven

Tough town

A cruel touch

Sailors leave

Sirens screaming

Lap of luxury

A show of violence

Take off your mask

Lay off my brother

Kiss my fist

Stop at nothing

A steaming swamp

And a troubled heart

The sky is red

And I can't stop running

Her baby stares

The secret's there

So help us god

I'll swing at your funeral

The stubborn air

The killer mob

A red bone woman

A double cross

Big fake bitter love underbelly freezing jungle

One step more he'll stir your senses scratch your surface and nail your head

Murded angels

Bodies in bedlam

A women scorned

You can't hang me

Tied to my job a blast scene alibi tied to a tree in a blind alley

Nothing before

A big fear

Don't get caught

By her father's friends

Swamp girl faded

The tiger's wife

A frenzied love

Hot climate

Twisted passions

Flesh parade

Dead ahead

A world so wide

Big river love camp

The house boy and hill girl

The agony column

Don't crowd me

It's time for crime

Strange breed river girl's misery index

Inside my head my dog's a bear

She was significant

I'm insane


Inside my head my dog's a bear

She was significant

I'm insane


Inside my head my dog's a bear

She was significant

I'm insane


Inside my head my dog's a bear

She was significant


I'm insane

// Death Valley '69 //

[Thurston]


Groooooahhh!


You're right


You're right


And now in the canyon

Out in the yonder

She started to holler


So I had to hit it


I got sand in my mouth

And you got sun in your eyes

Blind 

And you wanted to get there

But I couldn't go faster


So I started to hit it

So I started to hit it

I started to hit it

[both]


Coming down

Sadie, I love it

Now now now

Death valley '69


You're right

You're right

You're right


I was on the wrong track

We're deep in the valley

How deep in the gulley


She started to holler

I didn't wanna

I didn't wanna

I didn't wanna

I didn't wanna

But she started to holler


Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Deep in the valley

In the trunk of an old car

In the back of a chevvy


But you couldn't go faster


Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Hit it

Hit it


Coming down

Sadie, I love it

Now now now

Death valley '69

Death valley '69

Death valley '69

Death valley '69

[Lydia Lunch]


You were right


And now in the canyon

Way out in the yonder


You got sand in your mouth

I got sun in your eyes

Blinded


I wanted to get there


You couldn't go faster


Hit it


Ieieieioooooaoaoaieeih!

// Satan Is Boring //

[Thurston]

What are you waiting for?


Satan flirts

I'm prepared

It's nothing to conquer

The fight is good

Your flesh has a limit

Of too many years

It's a shock absorber of your stinging tears

The satisfaction

And power

And control

And piss

Is ruled by the laws of deception

Lost in laws of deception

We shake our heads

As your tables turn

They'll always turn

And you'll never burn

That's the real promise

You'll never burn

You get the lies

We get the fire

You get the lies

We get the fire

There's a new girl in your life

Long red wavy hair

Green green lips and purple eyes

Skinny hips and big brown breasts

Hanging on your wall

One end slit the other's ripped


Support the power of women

Use the power of man

Support the flower of women

Use the word

Fuck

The word is love


Support the power of women

// Hallowe'en //

[Kim]

There's something shifting in the distance

Don't know what it is

Day's as dead as nights ?

Except for the feeling that's

Crawling up inside of me as you

Sing your song as you

Swing along and you're

It's your, your song


It's the devil in me

Makes me stare at you as you

Twist up along you

Sing your song and you

Slipping up to me and you're

So close I just a

Wanna touch you and I

Sing your song and you

Dont know what's going on but you

Wanna me to come along as you

Sing your song and you're

Fucking with me as you

Slither up to me

Your lips there

Slipping twisting at my

Insides and singing on

You're just a

Swinging man, it's not your

Swinging song and now i

Don't know what you want but

You're looking at me and you're

Falling to the ground and you're

Twisting around fucking with my

My mind and I don't know what

's going on


Swinging in your song

Twisting me on as you

Slither up to me and it's gotta be

And I don't know what you wanna do

And you're looking at me with your big dark eyes

And you're rubbing your body


Twisting
