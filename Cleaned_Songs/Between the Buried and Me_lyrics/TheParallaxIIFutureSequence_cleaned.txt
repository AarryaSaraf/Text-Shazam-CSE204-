// Goodbye To Everything //

I wonder if I'm alive
Breathe slowly
Open your eyes

Can you hear me?
Look at what's in front of you
An endless journey
Our end
What do you see?
What do you feel?
Were we ever really alive?
You know this is the right choice

Let's switch off together
Let's float to no more
Goodbye to everything

// Astral Body //

[Prospect 2]

Analyze my own matter from above
Blacked out eyes in an existence overgrown
Never fall back down
Trapped in myself
Sold my hands
Envy them
Can't find the one
I slowly start to cut pieces of flesh from my body
Dig in and dissect
Collecting examples of what the outside world sees
Under it all
I know the devastation I have caused
Upon myself and this world
Upon myself and this world
Upon myself and this world
Upon myself and this world
Speak to me freely
I am listening
Speak to me freely
I am listening

// Lay Your Ghosts To Rest //

[Prospect 2]

Under it all
A new world
Under it all
A new world
A new world made with the hands of madness
These hands
These hands
These hands
They will always do the cutting
Piece by piece the pain gets worse, pain gets worse
If only I could see myself right now
The gathering of flesh
Transforming my face into an unrecognizable state
Smooth out the eyes
Smooth out the lips
Every mirror is a past idea smashed upon recognition
Will it be found?
Will the right hands deliver?
The heartache I left
Will it be found?
Will the right hands deliver?
The heartache I left
Cut until all that is left is new material
Myself
Day in, day out
Deep down I know what I must do
So much happens behind closed doors
So much happens behind our closed doors
This key will open them
Expose us all
Crusty-eyed symphony
Awakened by my grunts and moans
Why do I do this to myself?
I suppose the choice was all mine
God felt so much better before the mirror glimpse
On the surface, I know what I must do
What I must do
God felt so much better before the mirror glimpse
On the surface, I know what I must do
What I must do
What I must do
What I must do
What I must do
The precaution documents
The fail safe way back "home"
Should I end it right here and now?

[FOLDER 502]

The precaution documents
The fail safe way back "home"
Should I end it right here and now?
That would be far too selfish
I shall end what I've begun
The creation of more
More of us
The skin and bones of destruction
An army of weak souls
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak minds
Weak life
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak minds
Weak souls
Weak life

I wake to my own whimper
Ship is counting down
Must regroup myself
I wake to my own whimper
Ship is counting down
The end starts now
Cut until all that is left is new material
Myself
Day in, day out
Cut until all that is left is new material
Myself
Day in, day out

// Extremophile Elite //

To see one's self is hard to explain
Last night was the first notion of this
Once again, real life and dreams are whirling among one another
Space flight navigator
A walking mirror
Galaxy drifter
Entwined together
To grasp the other hand
To hear the other speak
Space flight navigator
A walking mirror
Galaxy drifter
Entwined together
To grasp the other hand
To hear the other speak
Carve one's skin out of their own soil
Sends chills throughout my body
Carve one's skin out of their own soil
Sends chills throughout my body
Wake up, wake up to a dirt covered surrounding
Machines, machines in the distance
Wake up, wake up to a dirt covered surrounding
Machines, machines in the distance
Something far too familiar
The world comes to a screeching halt when I cover my ears
Lift off the hands and the claws work again
Digging graves
Deeper graves
Digging graves
Deeper graves
The machines deafen my ears with such extremity
Constant maze from digging graves
I bury my head in the dirt
It all stops
This sends bliss throughout, throughout me
Upside down dreaming
The sound of Earth soothes my entire body
Upside down dreaming
The sound of Earth soothes my entire body
Upside down dreaming
The sound of Earth soothes my entire body
Upside down dreaming
The sound of Earth soothes my entire body
Real life and dreams are whirling
A hand lifts my head out of the dirt
Pulling hairs from what seems to be my brain
I see him... me... us?
The walking mirror

[PROSPECT 2]

Eyes slowly open as dust clouds surround me
Surround me
Surround me
Speak to me freely
I am listening
Surround me
Speak to me freely
I am listening
The clanking of machines scream in the distance
I strain in order to get up
Soon I stumble down a dirt hill and see a buried man
Just his skull is underground
Once again, real life and dreams are whirling among one another
Walking into a certain state of
Walking into a certain state of
Walking into a certain state of desperation
Walking into a certain state of
Walking into a certain state of
Walking into a certain state of desperation
Carve one's skin out of their own soil
Sends chills throughout my body
Carve one's skin out of their own soil
Sends chills throughout my body
It is a corpse
Something is buried where his head once lay
A note... my note
My hands shake and I fall to my knees
Slowly read... "Please know, I love..."

// Parallax //

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw my astral body in space
For nights on end, I watched myself
I knew our pain was the same
Loss
Self-doubt
Isolation
Neither constructed or taken away
We have always known our options
It was the relativity of time and space in our shared conscious which brought us together
Now we are one
Two forces entwined to make a decision

// The Black Box //

I see all
I hear all
Build it from nothing
Let fringed wings free
Come soar with me
We build mountains to crush oceans
You're in danger from our creations
We build mountains to crush oceans
You're in danger from our creations

// Telos //

[The Decision (Prospect 2 speaks):]
Built to destroy
Born to compress
Every worry
Every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety

Built to destroy
Born to compress
Every worry
Every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety

Never speak a word
Just do as you're told and compete
Compete for success, for health, for sport
Climb the mountain of limbs

Built to destroy
Born to compress
Every worry
Every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety

Build the walls around me
A covered land mine
Every smile, every itch
A covered land mine
Push it deep down
Put your head under the ground
Worm discussion
Worm discussion

Built to destroy
Born to dominate
As I am you
You will never know
Just like all the fools before you
Here is what we must do

She writes:
I awake to a cold touch. Two arms in four-armed bed. The touch of wind wrapping around me. I'm trying to follow its scent. The scent of isolation. Every door opened, every aspect of our life... gone. Hauling around our memories. Every corner a display of our life. A life I assume will never be the same again. No signs, no clues. A game that I will question until the end. Where have you gone? Was I ever important? The late nights lend ideas, but nothing to gather actual progress

Years go by. The constant stare. The constant grip inside. Every organ grinding. Every day seems easier until I step back in our box. Boxed in. Surrounded by life, while suffocating inside a poor version of one. Grip the match, set the fire. Don't save a thing
Rebirth. Reborn. Now this is progress. The black box will reveal only this. I will sit. Sit and wait until not a breath escapes my body. Burning in our box. What did all of this even mean? More objects to represent a status. One we can't even prove. Hide behind what we have taken. You have done this. The memory of me will leave with the ash of lost treasures. Goodbye to you. Goodbye to everything

She speaks:
Was I ever really alive?
Did I stay, did I stay in his mind?

Goodbye to all I've known
I love you
Goodbye to all I've known
I love you
Rebirth
Reborn
Rebirth
Reborn

[Prospect 2:]
Do as we are built
Machines for the future
Bright eyed and ready for life
The dual gods of our time
Of all time
They will never see us coming
They will never see us coming
Let's end it all

Start from scratch
Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed
Goodbye to everything

Start from scratch
Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed
Goodbye to everything

[Prospect 1:]
Doing as one's told
A puppet through fear
The crossed finger clicking sounds
Inner anxiety with a smile
Doing as one's told
A puppet through fear
The crossed finger clicking sounds
Inner anxiety with a smile
Why can't we step back?
Why can't we step back?
Are we really this important?
Just because we can doesn't mean we should
(Let things happen naturally)
Personal resets through selfish release
At least I will enjoy
The worry slips under the door
You won't see me coming
You won't see me coming

// Bloom //

Get down here and sing the songs we sing
In bloom we come
Tentacles swing with the waters breeze
In bloom we

Crowd around
Drift down slowly
Get rid of your undesirable oxygen
Just drift on down with us
In bloom we grow
In bloom we grow
Together as one
This underwater village
Bebop skippity tippity tap those toes

Queen Sea will take you in
This is your new home now
Ignore the laughter
We will not hurt you
Your last wishes
Queen Sea will take you in

In bloom we know what life is all about
With not a worry in the world
Let the water move you
Move to the sweet sway of nutrition
Move to the sweet sway of melody

Queen Sea will give back life
We used you
Your purpose is clear
We never knew

Floating back to the surface

(Tentacle hearse transportation... Actual happenings or the distant mind?)

// Melting City //

[The Black Mask]

Creep in before the rise of the sun
Execute a story never told
Do not think, just do
No human emotion
Who says I'm even human at this point?
A poor example of life
Do not think, just do
No human emotion
No morals
Just a huge display of direction
Hear, then do
Profit
Sneak in the box before the rise of the sun
A four-handed bed occupied by only two
The window is yawning
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
In, out
Profit
Why would they need me for a simple confession?
Collect, then destroy
Collect, then destroy
Collect, then destroy
Before the rise of the sun
Collect, then destroy
Before the rise of the sun, the sun
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Frantic writing
Not meant for my eyes

[Years Later]

Frantic writing
Not meant for my eyes
Why did I keep this?
What inside forced me to see the ink?
Smoothed out, then in pieces, in pieces
I can't live with this
I must let her know
A valley of smiling despair
Self-doubt would be my first guess
Confusion, sadness, the other half
But lost through selfish measures
I can't live with this
I must let her know
I can't live with this
I must let her know
The robot has stepped out of his box
Foreigner in my own land
No profit
For once, no profit
The robot has stepped out of his box
Foreigner in my own land
No profit
Walk in
After the rise of the sun
Conclude a story never read
A burning smell creeps up my nostrils
A trapdoor locked from the inside
Incomplete me
Impossible conclusion
Me
Incomplete me
Impossible conclusion
Me
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Frantic writing
Not meant for my eyes
Frantic writing
Not meant for my eyes

[Prospect 2:]

I know what I must do
I know what I must do
I'm coming home
Fixed socket threat
Binocular vision
I see all
I hear all
Superior intellect
I'm the night owl
Built by the alien gods
I'm the night owl
A necessity to the existence of all life
I'm the night owl
I'm the night owl
Fixed socket threat
Binocular vision
I see all
I see all
I hear all
I'm the night owl
I'm the night owl
I return in the day but you won't ever see me
Only my eyes
The blaring, yellow sphere
A sharp distortion
The TV screen you stare at night after night
Over and over
Over and over
I return in the day but you won't ever see me
Only my eyes
The blaring, yellow sphere
A sharp distortion
The TV screen you stare at night after night
Over and over
Over and over
You are staring into me
Cut the wires and cut your ties
You aren't what you think
An experiment
They will send us to warn, but that's part of the game as well
Fucking weaklings

[Prospect 2:]

I still know what my mind tells you to do
Cut out pieces to form new
I still know what my mind tells you to do
Cut out pieces to form new
Am I me?
What is he?
Am I me?
What is he?
It's come to the point of opening the box
Carved in the side are the words:
Property of the Night Owls
Smash to unlock the desperate measures

Am I me?
What is he?
Am I me?
What is he?
He is found and I will drag him to his end
It's not selfish if it's what's right
He knows I'm looking for him
This thievery is for the bettering of all humankind
So it seems
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
And it is
Open the valve
Say goodbye to everything
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
Am I me?
Am I me?
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Weightless in the sea, sea of space
Never again
Seek the day
Weightless in the sea, sea of space
Never again
Never again

[Prospect 1:]

Eyes open to the sound of laughter
Like a mighty god casting his spells on the worlds below
The man is me
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Goodbye to everything
Goodbye to everything

// Goodbye To Everything Reprise //
