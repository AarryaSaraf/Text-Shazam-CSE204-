// What Have You Done For Me Lately? //

What's up girl?
He stood me up again
Again?
Well, what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?
Yes, honey, I love him, he is fine
He does a lot of nice things for me
I know he used to do nice stuff for you
But what has he done for you lately?
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dance until I thought I'd lose my breath
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

// This Land Is Your Land //

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, well, to the New York island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
I tell ya: This land was made for you and me

As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me, oh, that endless skyway
Now I saw below me that golden valley
And I said: This land was made for you and me

As I was walking, now, they tried to stop me
They put up a sign that said, oh, it said: Private Property
Well, on the back side, you know it said nothing
So, it must be that side was made for you and me

One bright sunny morning, well, in the shadow of a steeple
Down by the Welfare office, I saw my people
You know, now, they stood hungry, I stood wondering
I was wondering if this land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From Riverside, California, oh, to Staten Island
Well, oh, down to Modesto, Georgia, oh, don't forget to say Philadelphia, oh
We moving down to Mississippi, oh, Houston, Texas, ah LA
Yeah, you know, ah, this land is your land, this land is my land
This land is your land
You've got to believe, this my land
Ooh, this land was made for you and me...

// Inspiration Information //

He had a rainy day
I'm in a snake-backed situation
Here's a pencil pack
I'm gonna spread some information, oh, oh

You're makin' me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be havin' you
'Cause I am happier
When I met you

You're my little symphonia
(Singin' the weather)
I get a dogged blue ring (Ooh)
I get a slapped back echo
(Thought you were younger)
I get a purple string
('Cause it isn't in tune)
Beside the whistle cab
(Singin' the hours)
Along a frosty roadside
(Always in time)
I get another ring
(Makin' me happy)
That'll take me for another ride
(Up in the sky)
Whoa, Heaven is in her
She knows you're high

You're makin' me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be havin' you
'Cause I am happier
When I met you

Is that a dream storm?
(Dreamin' in and out of style)
I get an eight o'clock sit down
(Dreamin' for the other half so I can get on down)
Out in the country fields
(Runnin', smilin', laughin', jumpin', fun)
I feel the love the pretty sun
(Shinnin' on me)

Just havin' fun
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down
Smile, love and burn, and get on down
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down
Smile, love and burn, and get on down
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down

// Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours //

Hey, hey
Oh yeah, baby

Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Mm
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Ay

Here I am, baby, oh, oh
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands
Ah, here I am, baby, ah, ah
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, hey, hey

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ayy, hey, yeah, yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ah, I'm yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Hey

Here I am, baby, whoa-oh

You got my future in your hands, baby, yeah

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man
But here, I, ah, with your future, got your future, baby, I, I

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby, ah
Here I am baby, get it
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, yeah

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

// Little By Little //

Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little

You're messing up my life
Tearing me apart
Breaking up my world
And I'm giving up my heart, ooh
Little by little by little by little

I'm losing all my pride
It's really getting bad
Hurting deep inside
It's a-making me go mad, ooh
Little by little by little

Little by little
Bit by bit, by bit
I'm going crazy and you're causing it
Little by little
Bit by bit
I should stop caring
But my love won't quit

Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

I don't know where to turn
Don't know what to do
I'm walking on thin ice
And it seems I'm falling through, ooh
Little by little by little

Little by little
Bit by bit
I'm going crazy and I'm causing it
Little by little
Bit by bit
Should stop caring
But my love won't quit

I'm the queen of fools
Know the deck is stacked
On a losing streak
But I'm gonna get you back, whoa

Little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Whoa, little by little, yeah
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little

// Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) //

Woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
Found my mind in a brown paper bag within
Tripped on a cloud, fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
Watched myself crawlin' out as I was crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much 'til I broke my mind
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Yeah-yeah-yeah
See what condition I was in
Hey, yeah, baby, see what condition I was in

I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much 'til I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Someone painted, "April fool" in big black letters on a dead-end sign
I had my foot on the gas since I left the road and I blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I dropped in, check out this condition my condition was in
Hey, check out the condition, oh, my condition was in
Yeah-yeah, oh, what condition my condition was in
Ooh, I'm checking it out
I got to see what condition it's in
Hey, I got to check out my condition and see-
What order, just make sure it's all right now, oh-yeah

// Here I Am Baby //

Here I am, baby
The one who swore to never yield
And here I am, baby
The one who swore to play the field

Said I wouldn't let no man tie me down
Not a single one now
Wasn't gonna ever give my heart
To a mother's son now
Many a day I proudly stated
The man for me ain't been created

But here I am, baby
The one who was so love defiant, oh
Here I am, baby
The one who was so self-reliant, oh

Said I wouldn't need a man or nothing else
I'd be independent
Make a fortune on my own
And I know how to spend it
I'd be so stationary
Love would be unnecessary
But here I am

Here I am, baby, baby
You want me and I do but I see
Here I am, baby
I find you're what I really need, oh

Say you got me hanging on a string
Go on, let me drop now
Since you started loving me
Don't you ever stop now
Don't wanna be loved by another
I ain't going another further

'Cause here I am, baby, baby
Take me 'cause I'm yours alone
Here I am, baby, baby, baby
Yours to call your very own, woah
Here I am, baby
Just take me, take me
I'm yours alone
Woah, here I am, baby, baby, baby

// Take Me With U //

Yeah (yeah)
Mmm (mmm)
Yeah (yeah)
Come on (mmm)
Woo (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Come on, come on

I can't disguise (yeah) the pounding of my heart (yeah)
It beats so strong (yeah) (yeah)
It's in your eyes (yeah), what can I say (yeah)
They turn me on (yeah) (yeah)

I don't care (yeah) where we go (yeah)
I don't care (yeah) what we do
I don't care (yeah) pretty baby (yeah)
Just take me with U

Come on and touch (yeah) the place in me (yeah)
That's calling out your name (yeah) (yeah)
What we want (yeah), each other oh so much (yeah)
Why must we play this game? (yeah) (yeah0

I don't care (yeah) where we go (yeah)
I don't care (yeah) what we do
I don't care (yeah) pretty baby (yeah)
Just take me with U

I don't care if we spend the night in your mansion, yeah
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is to spend the night together
And, all I want is to spend the night in your arms

To be around you (yeah) is so-oh right (yeah)
You're sheer perfection (yeah) Mmm (yeah)
Don't drive me crazy (yeah), drive me all night (yeah)
Just don't break up the connection (yeah) Well (yeah)

I don't care (yeah) where we go (yeah)
I don't care (yeah) what we do
I don't care (yeah) pretty baby (yeah)
Just take me with you (yeah) (yeah)

Long as you take me with U (yeah)
Oh, just take me with U (yeah)
Oh, I want you to take me with U (yeah)
Honey, won't you, just take me with you

// Giving Up //

Givin up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin up is hard to do
When you still depend upon

His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness

(Givin up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I try, but it's just no use
(Givin up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I tried, but I kept recluse

The light of hope burns dim
But in my heart I pray
My love and faith in him
Will bring him back someday

(Givin up)
But it's just no use
(Givin up)
No, I can't break loose

Whether he knows or not
He really needs me too
Lord, he's all I've got
And giving up

Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)

// It Hurts To Be Alone //

After he
Breaks your heart
Then you'll be sad
And your teardrops start
Then you'll know how
It hurts to be alone
Mm, hmm, hmm, mm

Just because
You think you're so smart
Going around
Breaking lovers' hearts
Now you're defeated by your own weapon
Mm, mm-hmm, hmm, mm-mm-mm

Mm, mm-mm, mm
After she
Breaks your heart
Then you'll be sad
And your teardrops start
Then you'll know how
It hurts to be alone
Mm, hmm, mm, mm-mm, mm
