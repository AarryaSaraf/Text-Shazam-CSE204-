// Genuine, Pt. 1 //

You gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine
You gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine
Now, there's one thing that will seal the deal
Man got to love me with a love that squeals
And I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be Genuine
And there's one thing I'm sure not taking
To be fool with a man that comes home faking
Don't walk away if I ain't told you
Now that will be the day that I will not hold you

Because you gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine

Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
I'm gone

No money, no clothes, no fancy car
Gonna make that man a superstar
If he ain't a man down to his bones
He's gonna wake up one day and I'll be gone

He's gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine

Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
Baby I'm gone
Bye bye, I'll be gone

Now, there's one thing that will seal the deal
Man got to love me with a love that squeals
And I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be Genuine
Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
Baby I'm gone
Bye bye
You gotta be Genuine
You gotta be Genuine
You gotta be Genuine

// Genuine, Pt. 2 //

Genuine
If you gonna be mine, mine, mine
You got to be genuine
If you gonna be mine, mine, mine
Now there's one thing that will seal the deal
A man's gotta love me with a love that's real
I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be genuine
Don't walk away if I ain't told you
For that will be the day that I will not hold you
If you ain't a man down to your bones
You'll wake up one day and I'll be gone
You got to be genuine
Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
I'm gone

You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine...

// Longer And Stronger //

How long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Every hour seams like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well I get lonely baby when you're not here

Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Won't you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

How long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

I asked your mama, I asked your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you're gone to, baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Are we together or are we lost

Oh baby tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Will you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

Oooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Aaa how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Yeah, how long, ooooh
Baby tell me how long
Do I have to wait, o tell me baby...

// He Said I Can //

There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
Can take away the pain
After where I've been
I'll never love again
Then I found me a man
Mmm he took me by the hand
He look up to my heart
And yes he said I can
Yes he said

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

He said he could love me
Like nobody will
Said he takes me out of the valley
Up to the top of the hill
He said he never mind...
And make my love a little lighter
And never... noo
If he could take it even higher

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

Never found me a man
He took me by my hand
He look into my heart
And he said I can
Yes he did

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

// I'm Not Gonna Cry //

// What If We All Stopped Paying Taxes? //

I was talkin' to a friend of mine
Said he don't want no wars no more
They're building bombs while our schools are falling
Tell me, what in the hell we're paying taxes for?

Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Stopped paying taxes, y'all

Now, tell me who's gonna buy their bonds
Their tanks, their planes and all their guns?
Well, tell me who's gonna pay for their wars
If we all get together and cut their funds?

Yeah, listen people
Listen to what I've got to say

Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all

There's something on my mind, yeah
And I think I've got to let it out, yeah

They can't take nothing from us
That we ain't ready to give
Well, how can we talk about the price of gas
When they're stealin' our brothers and sisters rights to live?

Well, now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all

That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Children of America, it's up to you. Let Mr Politician know how you feel. Let him know that you're not gonna take no more. Stop paying taxes. Stop paying for corruption and injustice. It's up to you

Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Hey, now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Yeah, what if we all, what if we all, what if we all
Stopped paying taxes?
Stopped paying taxes?
Alright
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
We stopped paying taxes, y'all

// Settling In //

The other day when I was sugar
Just to talk to you
How I was swayin' and all aquiver
At the thought of you
But now it seems just like my dreams
I've got quite a lot of you
And I believe...
I'm settling in

Oh yeah, settling in

There was a time when I would hesitate
To steal a kiss
But now I smile as I contemplate
Your ready lips
It's been a while
Since you put an end to my restlessness
And I believe I'm settling in

I know my friend never believed someone would reel me in
But in the end, you were the one who sealed me in
And now my loneliness is what I'll never, ever feel again
Yes I believe I'm settling in

I believe I'm setting in, yes I am
