// The Game Gets Old //

So many times I've played the game of love
But it always ends in vain
I'm back in the ring with my boxing gloves
So I'm gonna feel some pain
Now, how many times can I lose this game of love?

I had a love who played with my soul
And it hurt so bad (hurt so bad, oh)
And I tried to live on my own
And it made me sad

And the game gets old
Just a memory untold
And the game gets old

I found out there are no rules to the game
And it don't make no sense at all
Like shooting an arrow without aim
Who knows where it'll fall
Now my cards on the table win, lose or draw

I had a love who played with my soul
And it hurt so bad (hurt so bad, oh)
And I tried to live all on my own
And it made me sad

And the game gets old
Just a memory untold
And the game gets old

Now, I had a love who played with my soul
And it hurt so bad
Then I tried to live, live on my own
Don't you know it made me sad, yeah

And the game gets old
Just a memory untold

And the game gets old
Just a memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

And the game gets old
Just another memory untold

// I Learned The Hard Way //

Something told me inside
That your love was untrue
Something told me inside
Something told me inside

You said, "Girl, it's alright
I would never hurt you"
You said, "Girl, it's alright"
He said, "Girl, it's alright"

Just to be by your side
I would've walked through the flames
Just to be by your side
Just to be by your side

Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
I learned the hard way about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

When I open my eyes
It was all around me
When I open my eyes
When I open my eyes

Clouds of perfume and lies
And a hotel key
Clouds of perfume and lies
Clouds of perfume and lies

And when I answered your phone
I heard a gasp and a click
When I answered your phone
When I answered your phone

Ooh, was that wrong number, wrong
Or was she after your love

Just to be by your side
I would walk through the flames
Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
I learned the hard way about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

Now I know about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you
Now I know about you

Just to be by your side
I would walk through the flames
Now it hurts me inside
Just to hear your name

I learned the hard way
That your love is cruel
I learned the hard way, baby
Not to be your fool

I learned the hard way
Well, I learned the hard way, baby, about you
(I learned the hard way, baby)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I know about you
(Now I know about you)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)

Now I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I won't be your fool
(Now I know about you)

Listen, I know about you
(Now I know about you)
Your love
(Now I know about you)

I wanna go home
(Now I know about you)
I know about you
(Now I know about you)
I said, "I wanna go home"

// Better Things //

I'm a better woman than I have been
'Cause I don't think about way back when
It takes two to love but only one to leave
It was you who did that dirty deed

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

It's a brighter day than ever before
'Cause I don't think about you no more
I got a new life and I'm feeling right on
My head is high and my spirit is strong

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do

I got better things to do
Better things to do

Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

I'm a better woman than I have been
'Cause I don't think about way back when
It takes two to love but only one to leave

// Give It Back //

If I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
If I give you my love, tell me
Now, are you gonna give it back?

And when I give you my loving, honey
Can you handle that?
When I give you my loving, baby
Can you handle that, well?

You're on my mind
Wondering all the time
I just want to know
If you're mine

When I give my loving
Want yours in return
If not, don't you waste my time

If I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
When I give you just a little of my love
Now, can you handle that?

Oh baby, oh baby, can't you see
You're the only one
Make me feel so free

When I give my love
I want your love in return
If you can't give it back
Boy, don't you waste my time, ho, oh
Don't you waste my time, no, no

Are you gonna give it back, baby
Are you gonna give it back
Are you gonna give it back, yeah
Are you, I got to know you, baby

When I give you my loving, yeah
(Are you gonna give it back)
I want to know, baby
Are you gonna give it back

When I give you just a little
Little, little bit of my love
(Are you gonna give it back)
Need your love, want your love
(Are you gonna give it back)

(Are you gonna give it back)
Give it back
(Are you gonna give it back)
I gotta know, I want to feel
(Are you gonna give it back)
I wanna feel, I wanna know
(Are you gonna give it back)

// Money //

Yeah, money
Without money what would we do?
We got a little idea
We see what's gone

We say, "Money is the root of all evil"
But there ain't nothing evil about money

Because we need that money
To pay the bills
To pay the rent

Banks folding
President scratching his head
The economy is bad

Wall Street about to lose their mind
Going up and down
Gas prices, up and down
Nobody knows what to do

You know what we need though

Money, where have you gone to?
Money, where have you gone to?

I gotta pay my bills
Gotta pay my rent
I'm hungry and I'm tired
But my money's all spent

Money, where have you gone to?
Money, where are you hiding?
I said, "Money, where are you hiding?"

I work like a dog, year after year
Like a ghost when I need you
You always disappear

Money, where are you hiding?
Money, why won't you stay a while?
I said, "Money, why won't you stay a while?"

You see we scrimp we save
Like to keep you around
When you needed, you're nowhere to be found
Money, why won't you stay a while?

Honey, get that money, yo
You go out and sell everything you own

Hell no
I'm a scrimp
I'ma keep on scrimpin' to the top
Ain't gonna stand on no corners
Shoo them

Money, why don't you like me?
Money, why don't you like me?

Was it something that I said?
Was it something that I done?
I always let you play me
But you never liked me, none

Money, why don't you like me?

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through

// Window Shopping //

You know, we walk down the street
It seems like, be with your man and
His eyes just turn every time a woman walk by
Like he just can't decide
Gonna get whiplash, looking so hard

Can't he make up his mind?
And I think I know this relationship
The same way, I don't know
I think I might be just wasting my time
But you know what, let me tell you, baby

I'm through with your window shopping, baby
I'm through waiting when you're gonna come around
I know the question isn't if you love me
But I know the answer is you'll never settle down

Oh boy, you keep window shopping
You browse around with no intent to buy
Soon you'll understand or maybe
You'll finally get it when the store close down

And I know it was never meant to be
So won't you just keep on
Keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You let a good thing pass you by

It hurt, I can't keep going though this
I'm not sold thinking you're right for me
Because of right now I no longer need you
But I need you to stop convincing me

And I know it wasn't meant to be
So won't you just keep on
Keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You let a good thing pass you by

You just keep on, keep on, keep on

Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)
Keep window shopping, baby (Keep window shopping, baby)

You just keep on, keep on, keep on
You keep looking, keep looking
You let a good thing pass you by

You just keep on looking
You just keep on window shopping

You just keep on, keep on, keep on

You keep looking, keep looking...

// She Ain't A Child No More //

She'd just run when you raised a hand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
She was just too young then to understand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Came home drunk in the middle of the night
Screaming and swinging with all of your might
But a child couldn't put up a fight
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Poor little girl she had to grow up quick
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
Her heart's still soft, but her skin got thick
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

How could a mother be so reckless and wild?
Put your kid through such torture and trial
You could only have the love of your child
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

(She ain't a child no more)
(She ain't a child no more)

You could only have the love of your child
She ain't a child no more
She ain't a child no more

Now listen, used to think she done something wrong
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Now her body and her mind has grown strong
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

I bet you never thought she'd grow up so tall
Stand eye to eye, toe to toe with her ma
You know you never thought she toed the law
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

She ain't a child no more
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child

No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child
No, no, no, she ain't a child

// I'll Still Be True //

You call me your woman
Then you go and do me wrong
Expecting me to carry on
Like it's good

We always hurt each other
Even though we're miles apart
You leave me with a wounded heart
Over you

Loving you
It's so easy to do
You can say that we're through
I'll still be true

You took me for granted
One too many times
Now these teary eyes
Can't go on

I made my decision
And I tried to walk away
But Lord, you know
I wanna stay by your side

Baby, loving you
Always so easy to do
'Cause you can say that we're through
I'll still be true

You took me for granted
One too many times
Now these teary eyes
Can't go on

I made my decision
And I tried to walk away
But Lord, you know
I wanna stay by your side

Baby, loving you
It's so easy to do
You can say that we're through
I'm gonna be still loving only, only you

Loving only you
Deep down in my heart
Loving only you
Oh yes, I am, only you

I'm trying to believe that you've changed, yeah
I'm trying, trying to believe that you've changed

Deep down in my heart I want to believe
Trying to believe that you've changed

// Without A Heart //

Without a heart, I could be so free
I wouldn't feel no pain for others' misery
Without a heart, I wouldn't care at all
If people go hungry or a soldier falls

Well, the only thing that couldn't be done
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
I could love no one
No, no, no, no, I could love no one

I could make a lot of money
Spend it on foolish things
Pinch a penny off of poor folks
Oh, the fortune that would bring

I wouldn't be my brother's keeper
If a stranger can't get by
I wouldn't have to lift a finger
I could let a stranger die

Whoa, the only thing that couldn't be done
Is without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
I could love no one
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I could love no one

Yeah, without a heart
I couldn't love my brother and sisters
And you know, but for brother and sisters
You'll find yourself all alone without a heart

And without a heart
When that brother said, "I need a dollar, I need a dime"
You would turn your back on him
I could be so cold

I could make a lot of money
Spend it on foolish things
Pinch a penny off of poor folks
The fortune that would bring

Oh, the only thing that couldn't be done
Is without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, without a heart
(Hey, hey, hey)

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart

Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart
Without a heart

// If You Call //

I been layin'
Alone for hours
But I haven't slept at all
These eyes are closed
But I'm listening

For your call
For your call

These feet, too tired for walking
And these knees too weak to crawl
But these arms are strong enough to hold you

If you call
If you call

Am I dead
Or am I living
I feel no blood in these veins
But I could live, live and die like this forever
If I know I'll taste your lips again

Doctor, doctor
Come cut my heart out
Cause it hardly ohh beats at all
But please, please leave a little potion
Just in case my baby calls
Just in case ohh my baby calls

If you call
If you call
If you call

// Mama Don't Like My Man //

Ooooh mama mama mama
Why you don't like my man
Ooooh mama mama mama
Why can't you understand

You say he's rough around the edges
He don't always act right
But when we're all alone
Don't you know he treats me right

Now loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man

Don't like the way he dresses
Or the cigarettes he smokes
Don't like the company he keeps
Or the color of his jokes
You say he ain't no good
He says he's rough and he is lazy
How can I explain
How the way he drives me crazy

But loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man

Ooooh mama mama mama
Why you don't like my man
Ooooh mama mama mama
Why can't you understand

Loving him could be so easy
Loving him could be so easy
But mama don't like my man
No she don't like my man
