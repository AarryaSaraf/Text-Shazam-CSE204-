// Retreat! //

I see you coming from a mile away
And you're looking real cocky
You think you can keep the sea at bay
But it's about to get mmm choppy
Play with me and you'll play with fire
I can make you pay
I'll burn you up if it's my desire
Do you hear what I say?

Boy you don't know what I'm all about
I'll chew you up and then I'll spit you out
So if you know what's good for you

Retreat
Yeah ah ah
Retreat yeah
Step back boy cause you can't fix "crazy"
Retreat, Retreat, yeah
Raise your wife at night cause I'm comin' in blazin'
Retreat, cause it's my way baby
And I don't care none about the rest of you
Retreat
That's what I say baby
And I don't care if it makes sense to you
Taking you apart is my kind of fun
I count to three and you better run
One, two, three
Here I come
Retreat

Hell hath no furry like a woman scorned

Come on yeah
Step back I'm coming in blazing ooh

// Stranger To My Happiness //

So many times there was a man, he met a girl, took her hand
Told her, "Never will I leave you my love" (no no no no)
But just as soon as he gone again she's flapping in the wind wondering what she must have been thinking of (hey hey hey hey)
She's a darling (darling)
I've been in and out so many doors
And I've always tried to keep my head
With all the men I've known before
I've seen plenty places
That I'll never see again
I've seen a hundred thousand faces
And only called a few my friend

But it's a mystery
Just how you came right in
And stole my heart away
And left me there again

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
To my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)

Now if you think that's a thing that only evil men can bring
Let me skin this cat another way (hey hey hey hey)
There was a man who had a plan
To settle down with Mary Ann
But she left him on his wedding day
He said "Darling (darling)
I've been in and out so many doors
And I've always tried to keep my head
With all the girls I've known before
I've seen plenty places
That I'll never see again
I've seen a hundred thousand faces
And only called a few my friend

But it's a mystery
Just how you came right in
And stole my heart away
And left me there again
I'm feeling

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like a stranger to my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
Feel like a stranger

I'm feelin' (feelin')
I'm feelin' (feelin')
I'm feelin' (feelin'!)

(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like
A stranger
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I feel like
A stranger to my happiness
To my happiness
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I've seen pretty faces
I've been to a lot of places
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)
I'm feelin'
Yeah I'm feelin'
(Feeling like a stranger to my happiness)

// We Get Along //

There's a child crying all by himself
His parents left him by the time he was twelve
He feels all alone
He don't want to live
He'll get along I'm not often wrong

(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife
(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife

There's somthin' a brewin' up in the sky
We're stuck inside with the candle light
But the sun is comin' with all of its might
I know, I know it'll be alright

(Through darkness and pain)
(Through sorrow and pain)
We prove again and again and again

(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife
(We get along)
Through all of our lives
(We get along)
Through sorrows and strife

As these wars keep rolling on
All of our young ones are fighting strong
Who's to know if it's right or wrong?
I just know we got to get along

We got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
Don't you know we got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to (get up)
And come together
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together
Don't you know we got to
(Get up)
And come together
(Get up)
Just come together

// You'll Be Lonely //

You've been searchin' all of your life
For a good, good woman that'll treat you right
But now that I'm here, you can't understand
I'm the only one can love you, love you like no one can

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

Now didn't I tell you, in my lovin' arms
When you was down and out yeah, and lost all of your charm
You let me feed you, keep you warm at night
It's gonna come around baby, it's your turn to cry

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

You've been searchin' all of your life
For a good, good woman that'll treat you right
But now that I'm here, you can't understand
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I'm the only one can love you, love you like no one can

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

You'll go hungry
After I'm gone
Cry my a river
After I'm gone

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

// Now I See //

There was a time, when we were friends
Was it all in my mind, or was it just pretend?
It was [?] and great, when he and I met
I remember the way, you started to get

He had my heart
When we were apart
You tried to take my man away

Now I see what you wanna be
You want to take it all away from me
Once a friend now an enemy

You used to steal my toys
When you was just a child
I should have known then, girl
That was just your style

I have his heart
Now we're apart
I hope you know to stay away
Ow!

Now I see what you wanna be
You want to take it all away from me
Once a friend now an enemy

Now I see what you wanna be
You want to take it all away from me
Once a friend now an enemy

// Making Up And Breaking Up (And Making Up And Breaking Up Over Again) //

We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

Our love like Humpty Dumpty up on the wall
And just like Humpty Dumpty it had a great fall
But all this huggin' and all this kissin'
Can't put back together the love we're missin'

We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

I know [?] I've been your fool
But in this case our love just ain't cool
Cause I've been strong and I've been trying
And I ain't the only one that ends up crying

We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

We can't keep
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again
Making up and breaking up
And making up and breaking up
Over again

// Get Up And Get Out //

I been laying night after night
You leave me before I see the morning light
I always say you're welcome no more
But when you knock I open up my door

I say
Get up, get up, get up
And get out
I say
Get up, get up, get up
And get out

No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears
No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears

All my friends they ask me about you
I swear up and down that we are through
Oh, if only what I say was true
Why can't you find someone new?

No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears
No one can know that you are here
For you I've shed so many tears

Get up, get out...

// Long Time, Wrong Time //

Long time since I've seen your face
Been running round trying to make my way
Long time since we said goodbye
I'm coming home baby don't you cry

What am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind

It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)

When I left you said you missed me so
Looked in my eyes said, "Baby, please don't go."
I took for granted that your love was strong
Now I'm wondering if you did me wrong

But what am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind

It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)

Now what am I going to find?
Crazy thoughts running through my mind

It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)
It's been a long time (long time)
Is it the wrong time? (wrong time)

// People Don't Get What They Deserve //

When I was a child I believed what they told me (every word)
"To each one shall come what each one shall earn"
And if I worked hard nobody could hold me (hold me)
And cheaters will fail, that's what they all learned
(Cheaters never prosper)
There is a man who is born with a fortune
A hard day's work he's never done (livin' on easy street)
He lives from the sweat of other men's labor
As he sips his champagne and lays in the sun

Money don't follow sweat
Money don't follow brains
Money don't follow deeds of reason

People don't get what they deserve (no they don't)
People don't get what they deserve

There is a man who lives like a saint (so innocent)
He works from daybreak to late in the night (work, work)
He's never stolen, he's never been lazy (not a day in his life)
To feed his children is always a fight (work work work)
I try to do right by all of God's children (all of God's children)
I work very hard for all I could afford
But I don't pretend for one single moment (no)
That what I get is my just reward (life ain't fair no)

Money don't follow sweat
Money don't follow brains
Money don't follow deeds of reason

(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)
(People don't get what they deserve)

// Slow Down, Love //

Slow down love
I can't pick up on your
Put it down
Your words fall all around me
Seen 'em laying here on the ground
Don't be cross with me baby
If I leave them there for the birds
Slow down love and come closer
Your kiss can tell me more than words

Not much time remaining
Let's not spend it explaining
One more

Slow down love
I've been waiting so long to see you
All alone
There ain't nothing left to say now
You can't save tomorrow on the phone
Our time is fleeting yes I know
But baby that's no cause to rush
Slow down love
And come closer
The time has come for you to hush

Not much time remaining
Let's not spend it explaining
Slow down love
