// Ain't No Chimneys In The Projects //

When I was a child I used to wonder
How Santa put my toys under the tree
I said, "Momma can you tell me how this can be?"
When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said "Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects"
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the [?] that got that magic dime
But Momma now I know, that you were the one
There ain't no chimneys in the projects
Not in the ghetto
Ain't no chimneys in the projects

Momma was the one
It was Momma Momma Momma

// 8 Days (Of Hannukah) //

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Days of love
Days of eight
Days of Hanukkah
Everyone of them glows with love

Eight Days of Hanukkah
Everyone of them glows with love

Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two

Day one
Time to light a candle
For those maccabees whose oil did burn and burn

Day two
Time to spin the dreidel
And hope that gimel shows up on my turn

Day 3
Fry a bunch of Latkes with applesauce, sour cream, and all

Day 4
We're cooking up the brisket
The kosher butcher sold my uncle saul

Day five
I like it more than PESACH
Let's leave the manischewitz on the shelf

Gifts for the children
Five dollar checks from great grandma Sel

Day 7
Light a whole bunch of candles
Gotta keep that SHAMAS going right to left
All the way until

Day 8

Days of love
Days of eight... days of hanukkah

Every one of them glows with love
Eight days of hHanukkah
Every one of them glows with love

// World Of Love //

If I had one wish, for Christmas this year
There'd be no more sorrow, there'd be no pain or tear
If it was up to me... Darling I would beheld you a world of love...
Haa... oohh
Haa... oohh

Listen now
We would gather round that... that big Christmas tree
And we'd sing a song together
We wouldn't have no worries, except for the weather
Watch the snow fall
Go hang some mistletoe... yo... the world of love

Let me tell you something
Every man would see, what the true spirit means
Peace on earth and love and joy
Each one teach one
That way everybody reach one
All the babies every girl and boy must have a toy to play with

Oh... don't you have no worries
Just for this one day now
Well then maybe the whole world just might
Maybe we might find a way to make this feeling last
All year round
Don't you ever let the children down... listen to me now
Whether you agnostic, muslim, christian, or jew
Children of the world, they dependin' on you
Let me say it again
It don't matter if you're black, your white, your blue, your Chinese
Everybody we gotta get together... please!
The world of love
We have a world of love
All of you beautiful people hanging out together
Holding hands
Sing a song
Every woman and child and man
Wanna see peace in the holy land
Let the world of love
