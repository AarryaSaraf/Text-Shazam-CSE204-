// Enjoy //

Flatulation punctuates the still night air

And I thank god you're here


I queefed - Enjoy

Make the most of my butt-toast

Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy


The laces of my shoes unlock the mystery

Come and share a treat with me

I can't recall the last time I washed my feet

We're in for a treat


Here's my shoes - Enjoy

And here's my socks - Enjoy

Make the most of my toe toast

Enjoy, my good friends - Enjoy


Flatulation punctuates the still night air

And I thank God you're here


I queefed - Enjoy

Smell my feces - Enjoy

Sniff my ass whilst I pass gas

Enjoy my good friends - Enjoy

// Wendy //

Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad

Wendy, Wendy what went wrong
Oh so wrong
We went together for so long

I never thought a boy could cry
'Til you made it with another guy

Wendy, Wendy left me alone 

Wendy, Wendy don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy don't believe a word he says

I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim

Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad

Wendy I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong

The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up and find

Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad

Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
[to fade]

// Kids //

Warning the Basemaster General has determined that coffee is good for your health 

Doug is bouncing off the walls 
Ray is drooling big spit balls 
Feeling cranky, logged all night 

Kids on coffee 

Where's my Bonus Cup? 
Come on man, fill me up 
I need some Krappers to wash it down 

Kids on coffee 

Kids on coffee 

Went driving down to San Diego 
Passing by the nuclear tits 
Go away off my earth! 

Kids on coffee! 

Thanks to modern chemistry, sleeping is now optional.

Hurtin' Crue
Hurtin' Crue
Hurtin' Crue
Good future
Get a life
Get a job
Get a clue

Thought it would be so much fun
Just played another solo run
Fifteen hippies drinkin' Coors
Yelling at us to play "Free Bird"
Needless to say, all of our pay
went into the tank

1420
I am better than you
You are a piece of poo
I am better than you
You are a piece of poo
1420

Thought school would be such a blast
Just flunked another fucking class
Told myself too many lies
My mind's unfolding before my eyes
Now I know how it goes
What it means to go crazy

// Sour Grapes //

Hi, I was just noticing you, across the room,
that's a really nice, pretty dress.
Well, I saw you smiling, gee..
I've never seen you before, and I was wondering, you know, if you, like, you know...
Ow no? Okay well, never mind, see you later.

Hey you, new wave, come over here
You're the prettiest thing I've seen all year
Hey you, new wave, don't turn away
Close those pouty lips and listen to what I say

Why must you smoke that clove cigarette?
Why must you act like you've got a hole in you head?
Why don't you split the squares and love me instead?

You're all shiny and clean,
I've seen you in my dreams
Like the Rolls Royce I can't have
Your presence makes me scream

Sour grapes - you leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes - I don't need you anyways
Sour grapes - feeding, feeding my rage

Sour grapes
Sour grapes
Sour grapes

Hey you, new wave, I pity you
When you get old, what will you do?
What will you do when you turn 21?
You're cockteasing at the singles bar just for fun
Tell me, tell me, what will you do when you turn 31?
What will you do when you don't know how to love anyone?

What you gonna do? 
What you gonna do?

Well, I wanted her cherry, I got - sour grapes!
In the cute purple mini, you're just - sour grapes!
Well I refuse to climb the ladder for you - sour grapes!
No I refuse to pant and paw for you - sour grapes!
I need love, don't need no beauty queen - sour grapes!
But still, when I look at you, I scream

Sour grapes - you leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes - I don't need you anyways
Sour grapes - just go riding right by me on the crest of the new wave
Sour grapes - feeding, feeding my rage
Sour grapes

// Get The Time //

When I get the time 
I'd like to sit down and write a little rhyme for you 
Just a couple few 
I'd tell you what you mean to me [x2]

When I get the time 
I'd put it all down and pick you up 
I'd say throw it all away 
The world is me and you tonight

Will there come a day with nothing standing in my way? 
Living that dream within your arms 
Well I'll make it happen someday 
I'll make it happen someday 
I'll make it happen 
I'll make it happen someday

When I get the time
I gotta get the time
I get the time

I look in your eyes 
Warm places inside I've never been before 
I gotta find some more 
I know you don't owe me anything 

When I get the time 
When I get the guts 
To live my life for me 
And do what I want to do 

I'd be the friend that you said you once knew 
Will there come a day when we give up and turn away? 
And I'd have nothing left, nothing left except 
I'd have all the time in the world, all the time in the world 

Time to remember 
Look through the window 
And time to cry 
Time to cry 

I gotta get the time 
Where can I find the time?
Get the time

// Cheer //

It's been so long since I had a smile
I've stayed sad for such a long while
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
You kiss me now and I turn away
I think I'm still kissing yesterday
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams

Out with the bad and in with the good
You feel my heart, girl, you're knocking on wood
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
So generous, I'm being kind
With selfishness in the back of my mind
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Giving yesterday's promises

It's been so long since I had a smile
I've stayed sad for such a long while
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
No more giving my mind away
Tomorrow's love will be yesterday
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Giving yesterday's promises
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Living yesterday
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Singing yesterday's love songs

// 80's Girl //

She says you're the only one
But she's an 80's girl
And she can't get enough
Treat you so right till your supply runs dry

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please

Vroom - in a brand new car
She drives to the beach
Knows the language well
The moves and the speech
Behind a blinding smile
Hides her empty eyes

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please suck my friends
Won't you please

80's girl needs a friend
Party down with everyone
80's girl needs a friend
Love you for the weekend
Won't you please love my friends

She's so modern
She's so stylish
Mohawk on one side
Long hair on the other
She's got all her bases covered

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please suck my friends

She always wants someone else
She's an 80's girl, looking out for herself
So where do you draw the line
Between a whore and a concubine?

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please

80's girl needs a friend
Getting the goods and having such a good time
80's girl needs a friend
Love you for the weekend
80's girl needs a friend
Never, never let it happen again

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please fuck

// Green //

I can't believe what you just said
You'd sell your soul for a dollar bill
I can see the signs in your eyes
The signs that make an honest man lie

You've got green on your mind
Now you've got green in your eyes
Say green is sex, green is power
Such filthy thoughts
I think you better go take a shower

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red

I can't believe what you just said
I heard your song, then I heard your spiel
Music as money has gone to your head
You're seeing green, I'm seeing red

You've got green on your mind
Now you've got green in your eyes
Say green is sex, green is power
Such filthy thoughts
I think you better go take a shower

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red

I used to listen and we'd share your love
It didn't matter that I had none to give
But now I want to steal your heart
Claim it as mine before the bidding starts
I've got green on my face
Got jealous green I can taste
Bitter-green bile because you're vile
And yet I covet what I hate

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red

// Days Are Blood //

The days are blood
No beginning, no end
Bleeding like a fountain pen
The days are blood

Alarm clock rips open my eyes
I'm so tired
Staring at the black spots before my eyes
Am I alive
Mirror showing bloodshot eyes
It never lies
Another day on the 9 to 5
No whens or whys

These days of blood
Eyes of fire

The days are blood
No beginning, no end
Bleeding like a fountain pen
The days are blood

I gave at the office
I gave at the bank
I gave to my friends
I gave to my enemies
You tell me it's better to give than to receive
So tell me why is it you that's bleeding me

These days of blood
Eyes of fire

7 O'clock
Got to wake up
Wake up

Look in the mirror, see my face
See the traces of yesterday
Oh, for yesterday
Oh, for tomorrow

The days are blood
Bleeding into each other
The days are blood
And I'm drowning

And as I watch the evening news
I realize
Telling me of the day's slaughter
I realize
Spilling innards on my dreams
I realize
As I bleed cold sleep sweat
I realize

The nights are blood too

The days of blood
Eyes of fire
Fire!
