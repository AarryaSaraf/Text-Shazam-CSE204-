Album: SomedayAtChristmas

// Someday At Christmas //

Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When all men are equal and none have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where people are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where people are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time

// Silver Bells //

City sidewalks

Busy sidewalks

Dressed in holiday style

In the air there's a feeling like Christmas


Children laughing

People passing

Meeting smile after smile

And on every street corner you hear


Silver bells, silver bells

It's Christmas time in the city

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing

Soon it will be Christmas day


Strings of street lights

Even stop lights

Blink a bright red and green

As the shoppers rush home with their treasures


Hear the snow crunch

See the kids bunch

This is Santa's big scene

And above all this bustle you hear


Silver bells, silver bells

It's Christmas time in the city

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing

Soon it will be Christmas day

// Ave Maria //

Ave Maria

Gratia plena

Maria, gratia plena

Maria, gratia plena

Ave, ave dominus

Dominus tecum

Benedicta tu in mulieribus

Et benedictus

Et benedictus fructus ventris

Ventris tuae, Jesus.

Ave Maria


Ave Maria

Mater Dei

Ora pro nobis peccatoribus

Ora pro nobis

Ora, ora pro nobis peccatoribus

Nunc et in hora mortis

Et in hora mortis nostrae

Et in hora mortis nostrae

Et in hora mortis nostrae

Ave Maria

// One Little Christmas Tree //

One little Christmas tree was standing alone

Waiting for someone to come by

One little Christmas tree that never had grown

Cried as he looked up to the sky


Oh please Mr Father tree, the tallest of all

I'm so afraid and alone

Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small

Light up someone's home 'cause


One little Christmas tree can light up a home

So one little child can find a toy

One little Christmas tree can light up a home

So one little heart can find some joy


One little angel who was riding a star

Cried as she looked down at the tree

Oh please Mr Father tree wherever you are

May I give him the star you gave to me


Then in the heavens came a voice from afar

A voice that was heard throughout the world

Go down little angel girl and give him your star

Tonight he'll light the world 'cause


One little Christmas tree can light up the world

So those who are lost may find their way

One little Christmas tree can light up the world

So all men may see you on Christmas Day

// The Day That Love Began //

Once upon a Christmas eve
A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to any man
Made a promise to the star above
The day that love began

I will give to him my lamb
A shepherds all I am
And so he walked the lonely sand
To find the place his heart was dreaming of
The day that love began

Over meadows over mountains
They came from valleys and from streams
Every poet and every king
And one little shepherd with a dream

But as the shepherd knelt to pray
His lamb just ran away
And tear drops filled his empty hand
He broke his promise to the star above
The day that love began

Then the smiling face of Mary
Beckoned the shepherd to her side
Today you gave him the best gift of all
The moment that you cried

Once upon a Christmas eve
A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to any man
Found the place his heart was dreaming of
And he kept his promise to the star above
The day that love began

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Jack frost nipping at your nose


Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

and folks dressed up like Eskimos


Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Help to make the season bright 

Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow

Will find it hard sleeping tonight


They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

and ev'ry Mother's child is gonnna spy

To see if reindeer really know how to fly 


And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To kids from one to ninety-two

Although it's been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to you

[Harmonica solo]


And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To kids from one to ninety-two

Although It's been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to you

// Bedtime For Toys //

Close your eyes, beddy bye tin soldier,

Mommy says that it's time for sleep,

If my folks were wiser and older,

They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep.


Don't be bad little cotton dolly,

See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?

Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise,

Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys.

[Speaking]

Ya know, every Christmas Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer,

sled, and a big bag of toys and he'll come to your house this year too.

But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time to see every little boy and girl because the world is so big. 

So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit.


Bless the child who has no tin soldier,

No brass drummer boy to put to bed. 

He will still grow wiser and older,

Loving one small rag doll instead.


He won't have a cotton dolly,

Mickey Mouse won't come to his house.

Hold that rag doll to your heart, nothing can destroy 

The beauty one shall find in one small toy.

// Christmastime //

It's Christmastime and its magic is here
It's Christmastime and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmas air
While the church bell chimes
And there's joy everywhere

Some precious gift lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

// Twinkle Twinkle Little Me //

Twinkle twinkle

Little me

I have a lonely life

I'm the star

Upon your tree

That makes your christmas bright

Twinkle twinkle little me

I left the milky way

Just so I could be with you on christmas day


Christmas brought me where you are

And heaven gave me life

I'm that friendly little star

You wish upon each night


Twinkle twinkle

Oh, twinkle twinkle little me

I have a present too

If you give unshelfishly

And make a wish come true

I'll always shine on you


Twinkle little me

Twinkle twinkle little me

Ooh, christmas brought me where you are

And heaven gave me life

I'm that friendly star

You wish upon each night


Twinkle twonkle little me

I have a present too

If you give unshelfishly

And make a wish come true

I'll always shine for you


Twinkle little me

Twinkle little me

// A Warm Little Home On A Hill //

There's a warm little home on a hill
And the presents are hiding somewhere
And the world is so peaceful and still
You can almost hear love in the air

There's a blanket of snow on the ground
And a bright little star in the sky
And your heart knows that Santa is near
By the twinkle in everyone's eye

There's gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir

There's two people that never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill

// What Christmas Means To Me //

Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low,
Lots of mistletoe.
Lots of snow and ice,
Everywhere we go.
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door.

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah,
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
Whoa!
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah ha ha!
I feel like runnin' wild
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair [i.e. tinsel]
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
Whoa!
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh baby baby!

Yeah!
Candles burnin' low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright!
Christmas bells are ringin'
Christmas choirs singin'
Woo!
Christmas mistletoe...
