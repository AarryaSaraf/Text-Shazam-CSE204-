// Caldonia //

Walking with my baby
She got great big feet
She's long, lean and lanky
Ain't had nothing to eat

But she's my baby
I love her just the same
Crazy bout that woman
Cause Caldonia is her name

Caldonia, Caldonia
What make your big head so hard
I love you, I love you just the same
Crazy bout that woman
Cause Caldonia is her name

I don't know what's wrong with her

Someone gotta change right here now

I wanna tell you something
You know, my mama told me
To leave Caldonia alone

(What's the matter with her
What's the matter with her)
I don't know, she says she's no good
She said, son, said, keep away from
That woman, she ain't no good at all

(She must have made a mistake, brother)
Yeah, with mama, there's always
God know what's down
(That's what I thought)

So I'm going down to her
House just one more time
(All right, all right
I'll wait for you)

Caldonia, Caldonia
What make your big head so hard
I love you, I love you just the same
Crazy bout that woman
Cause Caldonia is her name

// Don't Cry Baby //

Don't cry, baby, don't cry, don't cry, baby
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again

You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you, to treat you so mean
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again
Try me one more time

This could happen to me
My heart and pain

Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, not now
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, baby yeah yeah
Dry your eye, dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again

Gotta tell you one more time
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again
Dry your eye and let's, and let's, and let's be sweethearts again
Again, again, no, no, no, no

// Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens //

One night farmer Brown was takin' the air
And I locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house something stirred
When he shouted, "Who's there?"
This is what he heard

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us

We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all

You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
Kickin' up an awful dust
So point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, hit the hay

Tomorrow is a busy day
We got ground to dig, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So point that gun the other way
There ain't nobody here but us

We're chickens trying to sleep and you bust in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin
Hey, hey, hey, I gotta poop

Oh, tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
Point that gun the other way
And kick it up an awful fuss

We're chickens trying to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin

Ain't nobody, nobody here but us chicken now
I gotta tell you all
I wanna give a little soul now
Leave us alone, alone, can't you leave us alone?
And I don't bother nobody

// The Things That I Used To Do //

The things that I used to do
Lord, I won't do no more
The things that I used to do
Lord, I won't do no more

I used to sit and
Hold your hand, baby
Cry and beg you not to go

I was born in Georgia, baby
Lord, I was raised in Tennessee
I was born in Augusta, Georgia, baby
Lord, I was raised in Tennessee

No matter how hard I tried
Somebody always hurting on me

I'm going to send you
Back to your mother and
I'm going back to my family too

I'm going to send you
Back to your mother, baby
Lord, and I'm going back to my folks
My old, my old folks back home too

Cause nothing I can
Do to please you, mama
Lord, I just can't get along with you

Ow, ow, ow
You're so mean to me now
