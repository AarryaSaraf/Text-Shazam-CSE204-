// Say Something Nice //

Say that you like me the way I am
Just take some time out to understand
It may not be much, but I do all I can
Say something nice

I'd never do it to one of you
I'd say something nice if it wasn't true
I'd make you feel better when you're feeling blue
I'd say something nice

Say something nice, only once or twice
Say something nice, only once or twice
Say something nice

I wanna hear that I'm beautiful
But you wouldn't say it even if I were
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur
You wouldn't say nothin' nice

Tell me you think that my hair's real nice
Don't stand around and just criticize
Can't you understand that when a person tries
You say something nice

And it's oh so hard, oh so hard
To listen to the words that you say
Oh, say something nice, just once or twice
It wouldn't hurt, don't you see

I wanna hear something nice, say something nice
Say something nice, just once or twice
It don't hurt you at all, say something nice

Say something nice baby, only once or twice
Say something nice
Say something nice baby, only once or twice
Say something nice

Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me

Say something nice

Say something nice

And it's oh so hard, and it's oh so hard
And I'm dying to hear what I've never heard [fade out]

// Now I Need You //

You parting words still echo clear on the day you left me
If you need me I'll be there, you said you'd always help me

Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now

L can't seem to satisfy anyone around me
You hold my hand and see me through
All the things that bound me

Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now

Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now

I'm calling you now (oh now I need you)
Calling you now (oh how I need you)
Please come to me now
I need you
I need you (oh how l need you)
I need you (oh how I need you)
I need you (oh how I need you)
I need you (oh how I need you)
Oh how I need you, oh how I need you

Having learned to live with you
It's hard to live without you
You always said if I were down,
To cheer me you would be around

Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now
Now l need you, l need you, l need you, l need you
L need you, l need you right now

I'm calling you now
(Oh how I need you)
Calling you now
(Oh how I need you)
Please come to me now
(Oh how I need you)
Please come to me now
(Oh how I need you) I need you now
(Oh how I need you)

// Working The Midnight Shift //

I'm just a working girl, just earning a living
When the city's waking up, I'm going home

Working the midnight shift
While my friends are all out
They've all gone out dancing
They're out having fun

Working that midnight shift
For that extra little something
The things that are out of my reach
I need so bad

So bad, so bad

Seems like I'm always leaving
When all the  others arrive
My body still carries on
But I'm dying inside

Working the midnight shift
While my friends are all out
They've all gone out dancing
They're out having fun

Working that midnight shift
For that extra little something
The things that are out of my reach
I need so bad

I need so bad, need so bad

Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift

I'm just a working girl
Just earning a living
When the city's waking up
I'm going home

Working the midnight shift
While my friends are all out
They've all gone out dancing

Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift
Midnight shift, midnight shift

// Queen For A Day //

Queen for a day, queen for a night
Dressed head to toe, so you'd never know it's me, It's me

Ribbons and lace, shoes made of glass
Rouge on my face, off to the dance
To dance

To dance and dance and dance and dance
Queen for a day, queen for a day

Queen for a day, queen for a night
Just time to find the man who could be so right

Queen for a day, ribbons and lace
Shoes made of glass, rouge on my face

To dance and dance and dance and dance
And dance the night away
Gonna dance the night away
Gonna be a queen for a day
Wanna dance the night away
What I'd give to be a queen for a day
Gonna dance and dance and dance
Gonna dance and dance and dance

Queen for a day, queen for a day
Queen for a day, queen for a day

Queen for a day, queen for a night
Just time to find the man who could be
So right, so right

Queen for a day, queen for a night
Ribbons and lace suit me just fine
So fine, so fine

I shall be queen for a day
I shall be queen for a day
Can you make me a queen for a day
Queen for a day

// A Man Like You //

A man like you, a man like you
Could be my new beginning
And get me on the winning side of life
If I had you, a man like you
All the fairy tales I dreamed about
Just a breath ago would all come true

If I had you baby
If I had a man like you

A man like you baby, just like you
I'd share all of the precious things
That I've been saving deep within my soul
Well a man like you, and baby
A little ol' sweet girl like me
The two of us together
Ride the waves forever and we'll be home free

Well don't you feel it, yeah
I need a man like you
And all I want is to know
I need you by my side yeah
And I want to protect you baby
From all things in life
Well I do, yeah

Oh, what I wouldn't do for a man like you

A man like you, a man like you

// Sweet Romance //

Father dear, don't you hear me
I'm alone, and I can't sleep from crying
Father dear, well if you hear me
I've been held closely by a stranger

Sweet romance
The moment that my eyes first saw him
In a glance
I knew right from the start that I adored him
Sweet romance
I may never see the man again, so help me find him
So help me find him

Listen, if you find him
Won't you tell him just how much I love him
Father, I've only got you
Please, won't you make him love me too

Sweet romance
The moment that my eyes first saw him
In a glance
I knew right from the start that I adored him
Sweet romance
I may never see the man again, so help me find him
So help me find him

Oh, oh, oh
Sweet, sweet

Sweet romance
The moment that my eyes first saw him
In a glance
I knew right from the start that I adored him
Sweet romance
I may never see the man again, so help me find him
So help me find him

Father, hear me calling
You're the only one I can turn to
My life has been so empty
And he could fill my emptiness too

Sweet romance
The moment that my eyes first saw him
In a glance
I knew right from the start that I adored him
Sweet romance
I may never see the man again, so help me find him
Help me, help me

// Dance Into My Life //

Dance into my life, only for a while
Whirl me round and round
Dance me like an angel child
He's passing through my world
He doesn't even know
Time's not on my side
No word or goodbye, I'll go

So dance on, right now I want to dance on
Until the moment's over
And I'll be going home
(I'll be going home)
Just dance on, right now
I want to dance on
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes
In my eyes, in my eyes

Dance into my life
Hold the moment fast
Make believe in us
Nothing real in life can last dance within my life
Dance me to the door
I can't see the time, but the time has come for sure

So dance on, right now I want to dance on
Until the moment's over
And I'll be going home
(I'll be going home)
Just dance on, right now
I want to dance on
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes
In my eyes, in my eyes

Dance with me, dance with me
Won't you dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me
Won't you dance with me

So dance on, right now
I want to dance on
Until the moment's over
And I'll be going home
(I'll be going home)
So dance on, right now
I want to dance on
Until the moment's over
And I'll be going home

// Happily Ever After //

Happily ever after
Look at me, right where I wanna be
My life took a turn, it's a happy affair
I'm never alone even when he's not there
Happily ever after, happily ever after

Happily ever after
So carefree, look what's come over me
All my prayers have been answered, he heard my cry
Took all my troubles and threw them aside
Threw them aside
Happily ever after, happily ever after

Once in a lifetime!

I never thought I could be
So carefree, so carefree
Happily ever after

Happily ever after
Him and me, sunshine and laughter
We're never alone, when there's nobody there
We're never alone, we got love to share
Lots of love, happily ever after
Lost of love, happily ever after
We've got love, happily ever after

Lots of love, happily ever after
Just look at me, right where I wanna be

Happily ever after

// (Theme) Once Upon A Time (Alternative) //

[Voice monologue over "Once Upon A Time" instrumental]

Once upon a time, there was a girl
She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved
