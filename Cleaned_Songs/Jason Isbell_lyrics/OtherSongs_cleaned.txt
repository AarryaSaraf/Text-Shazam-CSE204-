// All I Do Is Drive //

Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lot of singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lot of loving
And if he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, if you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is

All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothing in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive

Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
Oh I'll dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate

All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothing in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive

If I get the fuel
(Fuel)

// I Follow Rivers //

Oh, I beg you, can I follow
Oh, I ask you, want to always
Be the ocean, where I unravel
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading
You're my river running high, run deep and run wild

I, I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you

He a message, I'm the runner
He's the rebel, I'm the daughter waiting for you
You're my river running high, run deep and run wild

I, I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you

You're my river running high, run deep and run wild

I, I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey
I follow you

// Mutineer //

Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum
Hoist the main sails, here I come
Ain't no room on board for the insincere
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

I was born to rock the boat
Some may sink, but we will float
Grab your coat, let's get out of here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

Long ago we laughed at shadows
Lightning flashed, thunder followed
They could never fight us here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

I was born to rock the boat
Some may sink, but we will float
Grab your coat, let's get out of here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

Long ago we laughed at shadows
Lightning flashed, thunder followed
They could never fight us here
You're my witness, I'm your mutineer

// Nobody's Watching //

On the brand new moon
When you stumbled around in a tree
Just sit in your room
Smoking menthol's and hugging your knees

Smile
Until you remember how evening fell
Smile
Until you don't need to control yourself

When the light goes on
Will you stand in the mirror for me?
Put your best shirt on
There's someone important to see

Smile
Smile like your heart can be broken still
Smile
Somebody needs you and always will, they always will

Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching

Smile
Smile like you've been here a thousand times
Smile
Like words in your heart and your memory rhyme

Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching
Remind yourself there's nobody watching

// Sad But True //

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They
They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They
They'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
Sad but true

You
You're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You
You're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do
Do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do
Do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
Sad but true

I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain

I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain
You know it's sad but true

Hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay
Pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reason, alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you
Sad but true

Sad but true
Sad but true
Sad but true

// Souvenirs //

All the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded color
Are all that's left to linger on

Well, I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they robbed me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this morning
They always look the same to me

Well, I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they robbed me
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Memories, they can't be bought
And they can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

// The Problem //

Remember Katie White?
She jumped the fence that night
She ran away in tears
Your sister drank her beer
We were just 18
The older girls could be so mean
Talking just to talk
You were still in shock

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"

What do you wanna do?
I'm scared to even say the truth
This has been the hardest year
Is it even legal here?
Trying not to think of names
Will you look at me the same?
Do you need the reasons why?
Is a chrysalis a butterfly?

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"

And no one has to know
The scars won't even show
At least that's what I've heard
No bigger than a baby bird (no bigger than a baby bird)
No bigger than a baby bird (no bigger than a baby bird)

Do you think God still sees me?
Coming out of this twilight sleep
I'm not sure who I am
Staring into my empty hands

And all I could think to say
Was, "Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright
I'm on your side
I'm on your side"

// They Wait //

She waits for her time to come
For the world to hum on a different note
He waits for every Friday night
To whet his appetite and take the antidote

Ain't it something how the night can shine
While you stand in line behind a velvet rope
Ain't it something when the morning comes
And desire becomes a little speck of hope

Somebody told her she was beautiful
Every time she turned around
But when she opened up her mouth to speak
It clearly didn't make a sound
Somebody told her she was dangerous
And she should watch the way she dressed
Well, that always seemed a little strange to us
And at her worst she did her best

She waits for her time to come
For the world to hum on a different note
He waits for every Friday night
To whet his appetite and take the antidote

Ain't it something how the night can shine
While you stand in line behind a velvet rope
Ain't it something when the morning comes
And desire becomes a little speck of hope

Somebody told him you're a man now
Hide your tears behind your fist
There's nothing left to understand now
You'll keep your tension in your wrist

So he stepped out in the real world
And didn't know to ask for help
Until he stumbled on a real girl
And she'd been down the road herself

And he waits for the end to start
For her to break his heart
To hear the truth at last
She waits for the sun to rise
Behind his midnight eyes
And know which storm had passed

And ain't it something how the night can shine
Through a bottle of wine against a bedroom wall
Ain't it something when her eyes light up
And it's exactly enough, and you can let yourself fall

They moved together through a thousand little storms
And somehow the big one never came
Used all their anger up to keep each other warm enough
Not every dark cloud looks the same
