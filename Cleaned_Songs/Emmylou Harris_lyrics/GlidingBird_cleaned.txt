// I'll Be Your Baby Tonight //

Close your eyes, close the door,
You don't have to worry any more.
I'll be your baby tonight.

Shut the light, shut the shade,
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
We're gonna forget it.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
But we're gonna let it,
You won't regret it.

Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.

// Fugue For The Ox //

Calliope calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round

Doesn't matter when you came
Every ride is just the same
Do not worry how it's done
There is room for everyone

Carousel turning children are yearning
To ride it forever and never come down
Little one's singing older one's clinging
Everyone riding the merry-go-round
Go round and round and up and down

Round and round they go always reaching for the ring of gold
Never knowing when the music's over they will be old

Calliope calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round

Sometimes up and sometimes down
Don't let your feet ever touch the ground
Sometimes right and sometimes wrong
You'll end up where you belong

Sound of their laughter makes the ride faster
Soon the circus stand must come down
Music grows nowhere the ride is over
Say goodbye to the merry-go-round

// I Saw The Light //

I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

Just like a blind man I wandered a long,
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray,
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more in darkness no more in night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

// Clocks //

Old brown clock ticking on my shelf
Take my mind to someplace else
Little gold clock ticking by my bed
Funny little people dancing 'round my head

Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet face

Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...

Time is always taking me
Places I don't want to be
But when the morning rise the moon
I know a bird day's coming soon

Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...

Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet face

// Black Gypsy //

Broken bottles, broken songs
Broken people been in town too long
Where's everyone gone

Ooh, baby this city gonna break your heart
Oh, gipsy please tell me
Where everyone's gone

Never had a second name
Never spoke of why we came
Fellowship and Gloriousness
The loneliness of pain
Sitting in the rain

Why is the soul of me
Where is my heart
Where is the part of me
That I would give to you
If kindness were my style

Where is the soul of me
Where is my heart
In my own time
Better leave it behind
In a thousand bottles of wine

Oh, precious plans of standing strong
Why is life taking so long
I would tell you everything
If I only had the words to explain
Don't know nothing but the rain

Why is the soul of me
Where is my heart
Where is the part of me
That I would give to you
If kindness were my style

Where is the tenderness
Where is the warmth
In my own soul
That I let it grow old
Oh, it's getting so cold

Broken bottles, broken songs
Broken faces been in town too long
Where has everyone gone

Oh, baby this city gonna break your heart
Oh, gipsy please tell me
Where everyone's gone

Oh, gipsy please tell me
Where everyone's gone
Where everyone's gone
Where everyone's gone

// Gliding Bird //

Gliding bird gliding through the sky
I'm wondering why I can't be why I can't be as free
Gliding bird gliding all day long
Sing your secret song away from all these faces that I see
Is where I want to be

My feet are so tired
They walked too many miles
If I run so wild like heaven's child
I'll learn to fly someday

Gliding bird riding in the sun
Rainbow colors run
I hear the wind
I hear its mournful call

Gliding bird high above the sea
Is it longing to be free
Your voice is silent
But your wings tell all

// Everybody's Talkin' //

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word their sayin'
Only the echos of my mind
People stop and stare
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast winds
Sailin' on summer breeze
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast winds
Sailin' on summer breeze
And skippin' over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word their sayin'
Only the echos of my mind
I won't let you leave my love behind
No i won't let you leave
I won't let you leave my love behind

// Bobbie's Gone //

Beneath her clothes her heart is breaking
Spends her mornings making lines
Though her pain is real and aching
All she owns are borrowed lines

Doesn't know which side to be on
Though she's trying every door
Only needs the floor she sleeps on
All she asks is a little more time

Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before

The day she left her shirt was clinging
To her back wet with rain
I watched her leave heard her singing
A song she wrote when Christmas came

Bobbie's young but getting older
The face she shows is not her own
Winter's near it's getting colder
California's called her home again

Bobbie's gone to California
I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before

The mirror gives back no reflection
Of shadow she will not see
It understands she needs protection
Of what she swears she has to be

Bobbie's nights are empty tables
Hold her 'til she's made to leave
Bobbie's dreams are empty fables
She makes herself believe
To be free

Sometimes she cried because of visions
Of what she loved had all been sold
There's not much left no one to listen
To the echoes that she holds

How could I tell her when she's fading
She run out of a place to be
There will be no one waiting
For the poetry of her soul

I won't see her anymore
Bobbie's gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before

// I'll Never Fall In Love Again //

What do you get when you fall in love?
A girl with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a girl
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, she'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what it's all about
'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm not
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So far at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

// Waltz Of The Magic Man //

The very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

He asked me if I'd like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn

And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground

Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun

On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as he danced away
You know I can't even save my own

And now when I look up I see
The stars are dancing the same as he
I think of him wherever he may be

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
Charmed me like a piper
When he smiled
And he danced
