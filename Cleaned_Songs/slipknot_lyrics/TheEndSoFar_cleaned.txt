// Adderall //

Shallow graves and deepest fears
No one tells me why I'm here
Leather straps on stapled eyes
Gotta scream to cut your ties
Can't subtract from Adderall
Pull you in before you fall
Not as sweet as it appears...
Someone tell me why I'm here

Ooh, you know I'm gone
Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now

All they want is your control
For the Bible scares me so
Smell the ones who came here last
Must've lost the game too fast
We don't read between the lines
Cut too deep to see the signs
Watch me as my blood runs cold-
Now your Bible can take hold

Ooh, you know I'm gone
Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now
Ooh, you know I'm gone
Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now
I'm onto you

Which side do I want to be
This side's got a hold on me
Don't try this home for me now
(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)
Which side do I want to be?
This side's got a hold on me
Don't try this home for me now
(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)

Ooh, you go... I'm onto you now...
Ooh, you go... I'm onto you now...

// The Dying Song (Time To Sing) //

Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Die, die, die, yeah

Radical rather than rhetorical, babble like an oracle
Why am I always in your debt?
Father and the son and the holy ghost
Communist comatose, show me all the wagers are a bet
The middle of a nuclear winter is a modern achievement of the retro apocalyptic horde
Satan? You must be mistaken, there are no more satans
Only the bosses on the board
Forget, deny, ignore, nice try, it's you
Regret, rely, remorse inside of you
Yeah

Maybe you've been down too long
Maybe you've been down too long

The heart begins to suffer
When the soul has given up
And the flesh is barely more than bone
When no one else is listening
Only when you've had enough
Time to sing this dying song alone
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Die, die, die, yeah

Maybe you've been down too long
Maybe you've been down too long

Think hard, you bastards
You're gonna tell me why
If I don't get an answer
You're gonna sing and die
Think hard, you bastards
You're gonna tell me why
If I don't get an answer
You're gonna sing and die

The heart begins to suffer
When the soul has given up
And the flesh is barely more than bone
When no one else is listening
Only when you've had enough
Time to sing this dying song alone
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die

Read all about it if you want to know
Read all about what they want you to know

Everything is god online, and it's as evil as it gets
This is not a fuckin' trick, either follow or repent (No choice)
Get infected by a vertical event
Check the meter, check your watch
Are they ever gonna stop?
Runnin' out of daylight, nighttime's better
But we know how to handle the truth, motherfucker
Scandalous know-it-all, feedback chamber
Nobody wants the proof, they want a number

We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains
Buried in the back and I'm sick and alive
Hollow as a breath, the further you dive

Oh, how I missed your honesty
You never miss with your intensity
You're gonna need a new disguise
Vessels burst, veins release
Just slide into the nearest lie

(One, two, oh my god)
All the ligatures are getting tight, like a style
Murder another mouth before the trial
Scalpel and then you scalp 'em to fucking death
Kills for the other vampires and surrogates
It's a ploy for attention and evidence
All your fucking monsters are flaws in your common sense
Do the dance while the shovels are breaking dirt
Everybody mind your fuckin' business or you get hurt

We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains
Buried in the back and I'm sick and alive
Hollow as a breath, the further you dive

Oh, how I missed your namaste
You never miss with your integrity
You're gonna need a new disguise
Vessels burst, veins release
Just slide into the nearest lie

Read all about it if you want to know
(Everything is god online)
Read all about it if you want to know
(Everything is god online)
Read all about it if you want to know

Stoned like a beast on a chain lookin' dead
Feelin' strange, what the fuck
I'm material to sew into the stains
Like a catalogue of pain, like a martyr in restraints
I can kill with a will, and it's stronger every day
I'm a knife, I'm a gun, I'm a slit, I'm a scar
I'm a scream, I'm a death, I'm a threat, I'm afraid
That you will never understand I'm not the same
You better call the triple 9, I want a face
That you can only recognize
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

When everything is god online, nothing is
When everything is god online, nothing is

// Yen //

You're the sin that I've been waiting for
The hands around my throat
It's all I can think about
The smell of sweat and blood
I would feed you all my pleasures
Just to drown in all of yours
Have you heard of me?
Are you hurting me?
Let me savor what I'm waiting for
A chance to make me choke
You're all I can think about
The taste is red and rust
Can I hold you in my mouth
Until I fade into this form?
Can you cover me?
Will you breathe for me?

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you

I don't know what has happened yet
A surge of panicked zeal
Worry when it's not effect
This game is fine by me
All the words for retribution
Only add up to revenge
Overpower me
Devour me

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you

Show me all the deaths are the same
Show me you'll remember my name
Show me all the deaths are the same
You will remember my name

I wish this pain could last forever
Forever
I wish this kill could make me suffer
For good

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I wanna know that I was dying for you
I died for you
As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins
I know that I am dying for you
I'll died for you

// Hive Mind //

Yeah

Rise, we're gonna need another witness just like you
Surprise, your inadmissible testimony might be true
You better pull the hood (Get it off, get it off)
You'll be lucky to tear the place down
Then you're gone for good (Set it off, set it off)
Scorched earth is your favorite sacred ground
Turn away if you know you wanna stay
But you're never gonna like what's left of me
When the carcass is down and the predator's around
You're gonna play dead if you wanna run free

You're such a tortured soul
But I don't wanna hear about it
You say you're not involved
But all you do is talk about it
Go bless this shit where you belong

For your own information
For your own entertainment
This hell comes to you live
And if you need some assistance
A little time to convince it
Dial in your sordid hive mind

Crawl across the broken glass of every window you're pressed against
And scrawl, your little bits of hate
Your little digital graffiti breaks
So don't close your eyes (Get it off, get it off)
When you're pulling your messages down
You wanna go to sleep? (Set it off, set it off)
You'll be lucky if they take you without making a sound
What a guy, God, I hope you fucking die
And your sympathies don't mean shit to me
When the competence goes and the predator knows
You better be dead if you wanna be free

You're such a tortured soul
But I don't wanna hear about it
You say you're not involved
But all you do is talk about it
One more thing
And don't forget to burn

For your own information
For your own entertainment
This hell comes to you live
And if you need some assistance
A little time to convince it
Dial in this sordid
Protect the hive mind

Hold on, there's a river around you
Swim hard for the other side
Don't drown to spite your critics
Just blow a kiss goodbye
Hold on, there's a river around you
Swim hard for the other side
Don't drown to spite your critics
Just blow a kiss goodbye

Isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?
Oh, isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?

Blah, blah, blah, I don't wanna hear shit
Medicals and miracles and all of the obits
We stay all day and leave all night
Tell me like it is because we know it ain't right, they're

Paid off
Catch a tiger by the total price of all the penalties
Let's go
And don't you wanna see another model just like you?

Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)

Oh, gang star, shoot it in the panzar
Could it be the answer to the overwhelming ordinary?
Pick a vision and just follow the clues
We don't need the conversation, we just confuse the

Breakdown
Oh, don't adjust your set
Now, careful, there's no feedback guarantees
Why now?
It always seems to be another job you can't get through

Your innocence is just a pittance and naïve

Upgrade the system 'til the virus can be sane

// Medicine For The Dead //

Yeah

What happens in the dark feels the way the blackout never does
Turning the gears, sharpen the blades of sheer terror, these fevered ones
But tell me the secret things, show me the bloody kings
Let's play a game where the winners always lose their heads

Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is...
Yeah

Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me

Before it could begin, the shooting stopped, the silence always comes
Now where do we go? Because you're walking the streets, it's no better (There's something wrong)
Pull at your privacy, a product of lunacy
Don't be surprised when the losers want to win... but then again

Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is...
Yeah

Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead

Yeah

Where does it end and tell me where does it go?
If evil exists, then only evil can know
When do we run and are they letting us in?
Where does it end and tell me where to begin

Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
(Medicine for the dead)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
You have to drink me

(You know you're
Dying slowly, dying slowly
Dying, dying, right?
Know that you're dying slowly
Dying slowly
Dying, dying right now)

I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
Stolen coat, not much hope with these cardiac blues
And I keep forgettin' I'm not a god like you
Trivialize a mirror image alive
I won't trouble you, I'm just trouble
Now, now, now, now, now

We don't have to leave it alone
We don't even have to be alone
We just have to think we're alone
So everybody leaves us alone

I don't serve my time
'Cause time don't tell
The grim is behind me
I'm always aligned with my selves
Come and lead me on
Come and see me on
Come and feed me on
The shit we all be on

I'm not a god, like you
I'm not a god, like you
Yeah

I'm runnin' in a dead man's shoes
Sacrilege, broken cartilage
I'm beaten and bruised
And I keep forgettin' to forget

The back is always front
The way is always shut
The one is always two
I'm not a god
The back is always front
The way is always shut
The one is always two
I'm not a god like you

Ooh
Ooh

I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
Dead man's shoes

When the beating hearts make the beating start, it means they've found you out
Nothing hurts you more until you can't ignore- it's something to cry about
Now before you know it, the scars begin to show it- no place where you feel safe
So much for getting better, it's just a matter... of when- to run- away

A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along for a lifetime now
But you can't run to ground
You can't run to ground

When the hurting stops and the voices drop, it means the guilt kicks in
They say they didn't mean it- they say they're gonna fix it
When they yell it means they care- aren't you getting it?
Staring daggers, pressing kisses, hiding bruises
When exactly does this feel like love?
Now the question begs, when you're the one who hates...
What in the hell are you passing on?

A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along... to last a lifetime now

But you can't run to ground
You can't run to ground
A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have to pass a lifetime now
A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along... to last a lifetime now

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, and I know it's you

Ain't nobody gonna cut me, corrupt me, instruct me, consequently
Condition your interruption to disrupt me
What's the matter with my image: the balance or the presence?
Older and still blown out, follow me, I know where we're going now
Pentagrams, penitentiaries, I've been here for centuries
I'm a product of the system, the price you can't resist
Fuck, I bless where I spit, cross the ground, get over it
Massacre disaster is the perfect one we need today

I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I know it's

Slaughter, slaughter, it can happen to a father, father, you see?
Everybody has a weakness, reveal yourself, I'll eat the pieces
Don't be judging me, I know the dues, I know the fees
I know the rules, I know you cheat, we never need to brandish heat
Psychos, cycles madness comes around, around, around, around
Tyrants, tirades love to swing the hammer, bring the hammer down
Famous and infamous, no way I'm knowing I'm obsessed with this shit
I just want to get what's coming to me

I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you

I was a sign, the sign was in the eyes, the eyes were in the skull
The skull was in the wall, the wall was in my head
My head was in the ground, the ground was all decayed
The rotting had a name, the name was a sign
Fuck you
Yeah
Yeah

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it

Ooh, I know the mystery is the fire
I wish it wasn't true
I know the fuckin' reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you

// De Sade //

I feel it now, a new restraint
The fool is only he who fools again (Again), again (Again), again (Again)
I needed all the pain you saved
To wash across my face like time began (Began), began (Began), began (Began)

Everybody lies when they say "forever"
No one else will understand
Pull the stitches tight until we sever
Break me in your open hands

Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be God
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just take my heart and twist me into knots

I know I never had a chance (Chance), chance (Chance)
Oh, I know I'm wretched and I stand (Stand), stand (Stand)
Seeking all the things you have
If I die with you, it's worth the life, life, life, life (life)

I was just a nothing wanting something
Only you will only do
Everything and more, it comes to nothing
If it doesn't come with you

Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be God
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just eat my heart and twist me into knots

Something dominating nothing
Nothing animate is something used
Fill me, wait a minute, kill me
Feel me, I am the mood: abuse
Carve, carve, carve
I am starve, starve, starved
For the warmth of your will
And the edge of your purest thrill

De Sade, De Sade, De Sade, De Sade

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)
I like it here

The sentiment, the sad things
The punishments, the bad things
The cellular, the solenoid
The outer reach, the inner void
I keep repeating older answers
The questions are all brand-new
Does the room seem smaller these days?
Does the road seem long to you?
The accidents, the bitter pills
The populace, the stronger wills
The innocence, the common sense
The rare occasions... exist

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)

Oh, I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)

The harder work, the darker thoughts
The ultimatums, the tangled knots
The long depressions, the shorter fuse
Denominator is you

Everybody has a cross to bear
I'll nail you up on mine
Couldn't tell you, don't know where to begin
Won't crumble, not this time

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay (Stay)
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day (Every day)
But I like it here (I like it here)
I like it here
