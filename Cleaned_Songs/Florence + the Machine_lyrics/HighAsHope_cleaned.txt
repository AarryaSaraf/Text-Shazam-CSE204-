// June //

The show was ending and I had started to crack
Woke up in Chicago and the sky turned black
And you're so high, you're so high, you had to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel

I hear your heart beating in your chest
The world slows 'till there's nothing left
Skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants (oh)

In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You were broken-hearted and the world was, too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I always held it loosely
But this time I admit
I felt it really start to slip

And choir singing in the street
And I will come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room

Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other
Hold onto each other

You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You had to be an angel
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I can see an angel

// Hunger //

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

At seventeen, I started to starve myself
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness
And at least I understood then the hunger I felt
And I didn't have to call it loneliness

We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

Tell me what you need, oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby, come on and work it for me
Don't let it get you down, you're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer but we knew one thing

We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)

And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress they're gonna crucify me
Oh, but you and all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty, and for a moment

I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage
You give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home with people, oh, and I'm alone
Picking it apart and staring at your phone

We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

Tell me what you need, oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby, come on and work it for me
Don't let it get you down, you're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer but we knew one thing

We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress they're gonna crucify me
Oh, and you and all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty, and for a moment
I forget to worry

// South London Forever //

And I go home alone
I drive past the place where I was born
And the places that I used to drink
Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet
With the art students and the boys in bands
High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met

I thought it doesn't get better than this
Better than this
There can be nothing better than this
Better than this
And we climbed onto the roof, the museum
And someone made love in the glass
And I'd forgot my name
And the way back to my mother's house
With your black cool eyes and your bitten lips
The world is at your fingertips
It doesn't get better than this
What else could be better than this?

Oh, don't you know I have seen
I have seen the fields aflame
And everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

And we're just children wanting children of our own
I want a space to watch things grow
But did I dream too big?
Do I have to let it go?
What if one day there is no such thing as snow?
Oh God, what do I know?

And I don't know anything
Except that green is so green
And there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with Spring

Oh, don't you know I have seen
I have seen the fields aflame
And everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

Oh, don't you know that I have seen
I have seen the fields aflame
But everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

// Big God //

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

You keep me up at night
To my messages, you do not reply
You know I still like you the most
The best of the best and the worst of the worst
Well, you can never know
The places that I go
I still like you the most
You'll always be my favorite ghost

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

Sometimes I think it's gettin' better
And then it gets much worse
Is it just part of the process?
Well, Jesus Christ, it hurts
Though I know I should know better
Well, I can make this work
Is it just part of the process?
Well, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts

You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

Shower your affection, let it rain on me
And pull down the mountain, drag your cities to the sea
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Don't leave me on this white cliff
Let it slide down to the, slide down to the sea
Slide down to the, slide down to the sea

// Sky Full Of Song //

How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

And I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play
In a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA
I feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens but I cannot walk away

Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)

Hold me down, I'm too tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
And take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)

// Grace //

I'm sorry I ruined your birthday
I guess I could go back to University
Try and make my mother proud
Stop this phase I'm in, she deems dangerous
In love
The spelling is a problem
As is the discipline
And I don't think it would be too long
Before I was drunk in Camberwell again

But this is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

I'm sorry I ruined your birthday you had turned 18
And the sunshine hit me and I was behaving strangely
All the walls were melting and there were mermaids everywhere
Hearts flew from my hands and I could see people's feelings

This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

And you, you were the one I treated the worst
Only because you loved me the most
We haven't spoken in a long time
I think about it sometimes
I don't know who I was back then
And I hope and hope
I would never treat anyone like that again

This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a fucking mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

// Patricia //

Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star
And I have to tell you something, I'm still afraid of the dark
But you take my hand in your hand
From you the flowers grow
And do you understand with every seed you sow you make this cold world...
Beautiful

You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her

Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh

You're a 'real man', and you do what you can
You only take as much as you can grab with two hands
With your big heart, you praise God above
But how's that working out for you, honey?
Do you feel loved?

She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her

Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh

Drink too much coffee and think of you often
In a city where reality has long been forgotten
Are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified
But you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love

It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing
...

// 100 Years //

I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth, and
I believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do
Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
And the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night
And never, and never turn to night

Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

We have no need to fight
We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
Get higher than those planes can fly
Where the stars do not take sides

Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

I let him sleep, and as he does
My held breath fills the room with love
It hurts in ways I can't describe
My heart bends and breaks so many, many times
And is born again with each sunrise
And is born again with each sunrise

Funerals were held all over the city
The youth bleeding in the square
And women raged as old men fumbled and cried
We're sorry, we thought you didn't care, oh
And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
How does it feel?
Pulled out all your stitches
Hubris is a bitch

A hundred arms, a hundred years
A hundred arms, a hundred years

And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

Oh, oh, oh

// The End Of Love //

I feel nervous in a way that can't be named
I dreamt last night of a sign that read, "the end of love"
And I remember thinking
Even in my dreaming it was a good line for a song

We're a family pulled from a flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

And in a moment of joy and fury I threw myself
In the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
I've always been in love with you
Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?

We're a family pulled from a flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

We were reaching in the dark (wash away)
That summer in New York (wash away)
And was it so far to fall (wash away)
Said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

And Joshua came down from the mountain
With a tablet in his hands
Told me that he loved me, yeah
And then ghosted me again

We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
I let it wash away, wash away
Reaching in the dark (wash away)
That summer in New York (wash away)
And was it so far to fall (wash away)
Said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

// No Choir //

And it's hard to write about being happy
Cause the older I get
I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject

There will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus could come in
About two people sitting doing nothing
But I must confess
I did it all for myself
I gathered you here
To hide from some vast unnameable fear

But the loneliness never left me
I always took it with me
But I can put it down in the pleasure of your company
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
It will be entirely forgotten
And if tomorrow it's all over
At least we had it for a moment
Oh darling things seem so unstable
But for a moment we were able to be still

Oh oh oh

And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
This will be entirely forgotten
