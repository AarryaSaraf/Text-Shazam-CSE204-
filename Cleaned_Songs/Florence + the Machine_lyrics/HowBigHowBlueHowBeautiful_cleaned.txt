// Ship To Wreck //

Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head,
Dredging the Great White Sharks, swimming in the bed,
And here comes a Killer Whale, to sing me to sleep,
Thrashing the covers off, it has me by its teeth.

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck,
Did I build this ship to wreck?

What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door,
Don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before,
The chair is an island darling, you can't touch the floor,

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck,
Did I build this ship to wreck?

Ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh
Ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh

Good God, under starless skies we are lost,
And into the breach we got tossed,
And the water's coming in fast!

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck,
Did I build this ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck,
Did I build this ship to wreck?

// What Kind Of Man //

I was on a heavy tip
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side
Like always, wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side
Like always, you could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool all colored blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage
To have me crawling back for more?

And with one kiss
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

But I can't beat you
Cause I'm still with you
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

// How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful //

Between a crucifix and the Hollywood sign, we decided to get hurt
Now there's a few things we have to burn
Set our hearts ablaze, and every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
And every skyline

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
A satellite beside me
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
As he hit the earth I left this place
Let the atmosphere surround me
A satellite beside me

What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We've opened our eyes and its changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now its all coming through

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
And every skyline

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
I'm happy you're beside me

What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We've opened our eyes and it's changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...

So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
Maybe I'll see you in another life
If this one wasn't enough
So much time on the other side

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...

// Queen Of Peace //

Oh, the king
Gone mad within his suffering
Called out for relief
Someone cure him of his grief

His only son
Cut down, but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth
When all that's left is hurt?

Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
Cause you're driving me away

Oh, the queen of peace
Always does her best to please
Is it any use?
Somebody's gotta lose

Like a long scream
Out there, always echoing
Oh, what is it worth?
All that's left is hurt

Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
Cause you're driving me away

And my love is no good
Against the fortress that it made of you
Blood is running deep
Sorrow that you keep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
Cause you're driving me away

// Various Storms & Saints //

And the air was full
Of various storms and saints
Praying in the street
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast
But you took your toll on me
So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me
And I don't know how I don't just stand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free

The monument of a memory
You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
Get out, get up there instead
You saw the stars out in front of you
Too tempting not to touch
But even though it shocked you
Something's electric in your blood

And people just untie themselves
Uncurling lifelines
If you could just forgive yourself

But still you stumble, feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart, don't give it away

You'll find a rooftop to sing from
Or find a hallway to dance
You don't need no edge to cling from
Your heart is there, it's in your hands
I know it seems like forever
I know it seems like an age
But one day this will be over
I swear it's not so far away

And people just untie themselves
Uncurling lifelines
If you could just forgive yourself

But still you stumble, feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart

// Delilah //

I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)

[Refrain:]
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)

Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around

[Chorus:]
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?
[x2]

[Pre-Chorus x2]

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
[x2]

// Long & Lost //

Lost in the fog, these hollow hills
Blood running hot, night chills
Without your love I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song

I need the clouds to cover me
Pulling them down, surround me
Without your love I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?

Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song

It's been so long between the words we spoke
Will you be there up on the shore, I hope
You wonder why it is that I came home
I figured out where I belong

But it's too late to come on home
Are all those bridges now old stone?
But it's too late to come on home
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song

// Caught //

It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
To try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true?
How can they?
Cause when I sleep, I never dream of you

As if the dream of you, it sleeps too
But it never slips away
It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day

[Chorus:]
And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

It's the hardest thing I've ever had to prove
You turn to salt as I turned around to look at you
Old friends have said, the books I've read
Say it's the thing to do
But it's hard to see it when you're in it
Cause I went blind for you

Then you leave my head, crawl out the bed
Subconscious solipsist
And for those hours deep in the dark
Perhaps you don't exist

[Chorus]

And I was thrashing on the line
Somewhere between
Desperate and divine
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Persephone will have her fill

[Chorus x2]

// Third Eye //

That original lifeline,
Original lifeline,
That original lifeline,
Original lifeline.

Hey, look up!
Don't make a shadow of yourself,
Always shutting out the light.
Caught in your own creation.
Look up, look up!
It tore you open
And oh, how much!

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye.
And oh my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

That original lifeline,
Original lifeline,
That original lifeline,
Original lifeline.

Hey, look up!
You don't have to be a ghost,
Here amongst the living.
You are flesh and blood!
And you deserve to be loved and you deserve what you are given.
And oh, how much!

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye.
And oh my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why.

That original lifeline,
Original lifeline,
That original lifeline,
Original lifeline.

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye.
And oh my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why.

That original lifeline,
Original lifeline,
That original lifeline,
That original lifeline.

'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you

But your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you

I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change.
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change.
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change!

'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye.
And oh my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why.

I am the same, I'm the same
(That original lifeline)
I'm trying to change.
(Original lifeline)
I am the same, I'm the same
(Original lifeline)
I'm trying to change.
(That original lifeline)
I am the same, I'm the same
(Original lifeline)
I'm trying to change
(Original lifeline)

// St. Jude //

Another conversation with no destination
Another battle; never won
And each side is a loser
So who cares who fired the gun?

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Let loss reveal it
Let loss reveal it

[Chorus:]
St. Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

And I was on the island and you were there too
But somehow through the storm I couldn't get to you
St. Jude; somehow she knew
And she came to give her blessing while causing devastation
And I couldn't keep my mouth shut, I just had to mention
Grabbing your attention

[Chorus]

St. Jude
St. Jude
St. Jude
St. Jude

[Pre-Chorus x2]

// Mother //

[Refrain:]
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to thee
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this

How I long for the autumn
The sun keeps burning deep
Every stone in this city keeps reminding me
Can you protect me from what I want?
The love I let in, it left me so lost

Mother, make me
Make me a big tall tree
So I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother, make me
Make me a big grey cloud
So I can rain on you things I can't say out loud

All these couples are kissing
And I can't stand the heat
I lost my shoes and left the party
I wander in the street

I put my feet into the fountain
The statues' all asleep
No use wishing on the water
It grants you no relief

Mother, make me
Make me a bird of prey
So I can rise above this, let it fall away
Mother, make me
Make me a song so sweet
Heaven trembles, fallen at our feet

[Refrain x2]

// Hiding //

I think you hide
When all the world's asleep and tired
You cry a little, so do I, so do I
I think you hide
And you don't have to tell me why
You cry a little, so do I, so do I

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep

I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in
Just know that I'm still here
I'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
Whenever you want to begin

I know you've tried
But something stops you every time
You cry a little, so do I, so do I
And it's your pride
That's keeping us still so far apart
But if you give a little, so will I, so will I

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep

I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in
Just know that I'm still here
I'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
Whenever you want to begin

I know I seem shaky
These hands not fit for holding
But if you let me, oh
I will see you right

Tell me I will be released
Not sure I can deal with this
Up all night again this week
Breaking things that I should keep
[x2]

I know that you're hiding
I know there's a part of you that I just cannot reach
You don't have to let me in

I'm still here
I'm still here

// Make Up Your Mind //

I never thought I'd be a killer
Cause there's so much to lose
But if I can't drink the water
What else can I do?
And although the axe is heavy
It just sits in my hands
While you're changing like the current
Not a shore on land

Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me leave or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for ya'
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall - go on, let it fall
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

I never thought that I'd be facing
A sea that's bluer than the tide
Now my knees are shaking
And I can't look in your eyes

But if you're gonna make me do it
How'd you want it done?
Is it best to sip it slowly
Or drink it down in one?

Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me leave or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for ya'
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall - go on, let it fall
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

The executioner's within me
And he comes blindfold ready
Sword in hand
And arms so steady

Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around
But every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my head around

Make up your mind
Let me leave or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for ya'
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall - go on, let it fall
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

Make up your mind
Let me leave or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck
I've been breaking mine for ya'
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall - go on, let it fall
Make up your mind
Before I make it up for you

// Which Witch //

And it's my whole heart
Weighed and measured inside
And it's an old scar
Trying to bleach it out
And it's my whole heart
Deemed and delivered a crime
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out

Who's a heretic now?
Am I making sense?
How can you make it stick?
Waiting 'til the beat comes out
Who's a heretic, child?
Can you make it stick, now that I'm on trial
Waiting 'til the beat comes out

I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
Crawling all the way
Crawling all the way

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
[x2]

And it's my whole heart
While tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my whole heart
Trying to bleach it out
And it's my whole heart
Burned but not buried this time
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
Ooo...

I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
[x2]

Chained and shackled, oh
All unraveled, oh
It's a pity, oh
Never to return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Chained and shackled, oh
All unraveled, oh
It's a pity, oh
Say I won't return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Ooh...

// As Far As I Could Get //

In the celestial vaults
I drew bedraggled breaths
Because I am unloved
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time

Past the museum of death
And the mad man yelling answers
I sail on new beginnings
And psychics taking chances
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time

As far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time

Past the spires and the temple
Looking like a Disney castle
As far as I could get
Past the girls late for rehearsal
Oh, a pirate on the left
And Jesus on the right
And the Pacific sweeps through
Like a bird in flight

Oh, as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time

Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too
Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too

As far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get

Past the city and the sermons
The cemetery standing still
Past the mountain and the monument
The houses and the hills
Past the signs and the sirens
The sinners and the saints
I went as far as I could get...

Past the hallowed and the horror
The humbled and the greed
I went as far as I could get
Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too

As far as I could get
As far as I could get
As far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet

I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet

// Pure Feeling //

Blinded by the glare
I was moving like I didn't care
But it was more than I could bear
You know I hoped I'd see you there

Staring out the window
I could see into the soul of every passer by
So many lives
So many pairs of eyes

A pure feeling
I'm invisible and magical
If only for a moment
A pure feeling
I'm scared to control it

Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be

And the illusion starts to tear
Let everybody stand and stare
Cause now I have no fear
I knew that this would end in tears

Staring out the window
I could see into the soul of every passer by
So many lives
So many pairs of eyes

A pure feeling
I'm invisible and magical
If only for a moment
A pure feeling
I'm scared to control it

Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be

Those strangers carry me
I'm lost; they're finding me
I'm gone; they're there with me
But it's not over
The spaces in between
They keep you far from me
The emptiness; it means it's not over

Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be
[x2]

// Conductor //

I tried to control my shaking
With just one sound
I tried to warm the ocean
By writing it down
I tried to tame my nightmare
Line by line
If I write a song about you
Does that make you mine?

The conductor caught in slow motion
The orchestra plays on
Over and over, the same motion
This work is never done

The only thing that's certain
Is your indecision
I guess it must be working
Cause you hit me with such precision
Now the strings are breaking
Their fingers run with blood
But they keep on playing
The cycle never stops

Who's in control?
Who's playing who?

She wants to be amongst them
Conducting them too
She knows the song won't save her
But what else can she do?
She weeps just like a willow
She's playing for you
She's fragile and she's ferocious
As the current flows through

She's a conductor caught in slow motion
The orchestra plays loud
Over and over, the same motion
This work is never done 

Now here comes the crescendo
The music starts to swell
And now it's so ecstatic
I know this part so well
And then it goes staccato
The notes were flying up
Higher and higher
But they never reach the top

Who's in control?
Who's playing who?
[x2]

I am the orchestra
The conductor too
My heart is a concert hall
And I filled it with you
