Album: Garlands

// Blood Bitch //

Blood woman
Blood bitch
There's a corona
A corona swelling

Pressing hands
Against this scar
There's no warmth
There's no warmth to be felt

Don't damage my altar
Don't damn this cold flame
Neither one or the other
Has much form or shape

Cold burns powerful
Has powerful needs
Holds back
What's my worth?
There's a fire

I'll paint the blood bitch
The blood bitch black
Left or curious
Your the same old son

// But I'm Not //

Sorrowful stories
I hear all that's shown
His posturish shiver on his things
And she's always known
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not
Vassels live lies
Their faith never cries
Giving in, getting in
Wishing what her sad grin finds
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not

Sorrowful stories
I hear all that's shown
His posturish shiver on his things
And she's always known
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not
Vassels live lies
Their faith never cries
Giving in, getting in
Wishing what her sad grin finds
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not

// Blind Dumb Deaf //

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
At the bosom
Or the breast
Or the forehead
Or the fist

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it
My mouthing at you
My tongue the stake
I should welt should I hold you
I should gash should I kiss you

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

Blind dumb deafen offends
I was never a part of it

// Shallow Then Halo //

Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile
The then shallow she
Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred
Stars in my eyes 
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capitol place
[x2]
The then shallow she
Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred

In my [x4]

Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile
[x2]

Stars in my eyes 
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capitol place
[x2]

In my eyes
At my
Stars in my eyes
In my eyes
At my feet
At my
In my eyes
At my feet
I have stars in my eyes
Stars in my eyes
I have stars in my face
Stars in my face
Stars in my eyes
I have stars in my face
Stars in my face
Stars in my eyes
Stars at my feet
Stars at my arms, Stars at my feet [x3]

// The Hollow Men //

Her aura supposed he is
For all of them home alone
And the soul, Sleeps for days
The hollow place, Slow
See him, So that if I'm lost
The hollow place
Slow
See him
So that if I'm last
All, Stake, Stuck, Stake
And I'm stuck
Balk

// Garlands //

Garlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary 

Well, with these brave garlands
They never find out for her
They never find I'm lying
Well, with these etchings
Cravings convince
My cravings commence

Garlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary

Well, with these scarve's scars
Cravings convince
My cravings commence
Well, with these splint's scars
I'm all that to you
I'm all that's who

Garlands evergreen
Forget-me-not wreaths
Chaplets see me drugged
I could die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary
Die in a rosary

Well, with these scarve's scars
Cravings convince
My cravings commence
Well, with these splint's scars
I'm all that to you
I'm all that's who

// Grail Overfloweth //

Grail overfloweth , There is rain
And music, And there is love,
Grail overfloweth , There is rain
And music, And there is love
Grail overfloweth, There is rain
And there's saliva, And there's you
Flinch for him
More than the other fakes
I sleep
Horizontally
You told momma
You speak
You wish me to, See to you
Grail overfloweth
There is rain

Grail overfloweth
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
Grail overfloweth

// Speak No Evil //

My soul I sold
I can't forget to ask
There's nothing movin' it again
Wolf thirst said me

Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil

I heal, I hurt
I can't forget to ask
There's nothing movin' it again
Wolf thrist said me

Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil

// Perhaps Some Other Aeon //

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

A change of head in hole
Oh well, if he shaves his headdress

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

I was near when you died at birth
I was near when you were born in death
I've felt the faces within you
It is a more sacred sin then on this list
And on the way there

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon
