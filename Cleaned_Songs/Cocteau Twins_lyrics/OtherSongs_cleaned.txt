// Alice //

When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(Deceived me) You deceive me

(With you) Erase it I will not

(to stay) Finishing a halo (didn't he know alice?)

(I will plead) I will not excuse you

(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
would share,
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
who shall
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
replace
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
You

When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo 
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(pushing me) Look she fell
(with you) Right there on the floor
(so you) Finishing with her life
(not me) It hasn't even started

// Because Of Whirl-Jack //

Fly, won't you fly?
It comes overreaching
It's that whirly-gig
It's also for jack...

Whoever comes clean or a hullaballoo
For whip-stitching
Please won't you fly?

Please won't you, please won't you, please won't you fly?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?

Aliveness
Exploration
Fulfillment
Creativity

It may be diverting
For some part of him

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Naming things is empowering
I balance, walk, and coordinate myself, alive
Aliveness energy

Healthy dependence
And healthy independence
And healthy assurances
This love's a nameless dream
And healthy boundaries
And how long would you miss me

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

// Dials //

Unfurl, I am far
Come from ascending sea.

Land, Land....
Land in places so dry.

Long, and I long.

Floatboat, bring my lover back!

Try, and I try.
Send boat of love..
Send, Float Leiber Boten

Try, and I try.
Send boat of love..
Send, Float Leiber Boten

// Flock Of Soul //

Whispers she softly, sweet songs in the bed of dreams:
No answer, sweet song light
Sing? I'd love to
to sunlight, a song in the bed of dreams
Cover me in Sublime light, with tingles
Sing, and touch me
With sad lust and revealing dreams
Your song light will touch me

Sing nice body, passing through and over me
So find me, come and answer me 
We find it deep, this, my minute, friend 
Not long before the wisps of starlight,
meet the sunrise thru the window (shining)
From outside, come in to toss me.
Come back now, to find the sunlight.

Come back now, put sunlight on, oh
Be with me and dream, it's my minute, friend
Come feel the deep
It's love in a floodlight
Come feel the deep
It's love in a flood

Ahhhh ahhhh oohhhh
Ooohhh ahhh ahhhhh

Sing and touch light, satisfying me
The sunlight will touch me
Sing as from me, pass it over me, sublime me and I'll... come back to you.

// Frosty The Snowman //

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop
He only paused a moment when he heard them holler 'Stop!'

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

// Golden-Vein //

Shunning punched
All of song
Will you spare
Last night, till dawn
Your eyes have mine
At last I've got lyric

The rest into
A mood of dust
Myself into
With eyes for me
My safe love
Bought

Showing emotions
New rules
Reaching out
Realing with it
Our mountain roses
Oh in their eyes and then

Little flowers in the dirt
And gladness will fill me in your hand
You hold and surround me in gold
Myself into
It finds a thread

// Ice-Pulse //

I am inauthentic
That's me not knowing who he is
I feel understands me
You don't love me
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
He mocks
Before me
I could have done something differently
You can't heal what you can't feel
Half beyond the consequence and
Hurt me must grieve 
Let betrayal in this
Also I'd leave our dreams
And best beyond chance
What might have been
I embrace my feelings
Share them lonely
Last the only may are these food
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
You can't heal what you can't feel
