Album: TheMoonAndTheMelodies

// Sea Swallow Me //

Can't turn up, somebody punch me, yeah
Seven sugars and a madman goes
Yell, I wanted more
Yell, I wanted more
Yell, I wanted more
Yell, I wanted more

Nosy tempers 'bout to play for now
Anybody who doesn't shy around town
Horizontal moth
Horizontal moth
Horizontal to mono re-zones and we'll polish your dreams

At least the sea where liberty
Will stand in place to seek and rule the world

Can't turn up, somebody punch me, yeah
Seven sugars and a madman goes
Yell, I wanted more
Yell, I wanted more
Yell, I wanted my man love, my big man, that low, lonely dove
