Come to my island, just you and me
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, well
Come to my island where we'll be free

Oh, come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, yeah

Under the moonlight doin' our thing
Just you and me and silence is the sound
Nobody else anywhere around

Oh, come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free
Come to my island, just you and me, yeah
Come to my island where we'll be free

I'll hold you in my arms, love you some more
Keep you in my heart for ever more

Come to my island where we'll be free

// So Glad //

I was so glad when I woke up this morning
Just to see the smile on your face
And the tender love that you give me
Leaves me feeling good the rest of the day

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Oh, I'm feeling so, so happy now
Not a cloud left in my sky
All I see is the summer shining
What a feeling, oh deep inside yeah

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Woo, yeah
Oh, I'm happy now
Ooh, I look good inside
Now I've got your sweet, sweet loving
You're the apple of my eye

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

I'm so glad when I woke up this morning
Just to see the smile on your face
And the tender love that you give me
Leaves me feeling good the rest of the day

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Hmm, mm-yeah, yes I am
Hmm, mm-ooh, oh
Hmm, mm, yes I am
Hmm, mm, don't you know?

So glad, so glad
So glad you're mine
So glad, so glad
So glad you're mine

// It's The Same Old Song //

You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song
And wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

// Who Do Ya Love //

I've got this feelin' all down inside
And this feelin' I just can't hide
I really love you, I really do
But I don't get the same feelin' from you

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love (Tell me)
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love

I would give anything in the world
Just to have you with me, girl
If it's a game I don't want to play
I'll just go my own separate way

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love (Tell me)
Who do you love, who do you love (Tell me)
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you, who do you love
Who do you really love
Who do you, who do you love

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love
Who do you love, who do you love (Tell me)
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love
Who do you love, who do you love (Tell me)
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you love
Who do you, who do you love
Who do you really love
Who do you, who do you love, oh

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love
Who do you love, who do you love (Tell me)
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you love, who do you love (Oh...)
Who do you love (I got to know)
Who do you love (Oh, tell me so)
Who do you love (Which way to go)

Who do you love (Oh), who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love (Who do you really love)
Who do you love, who do you love (I'm lost in confusion)
Who do you really, really, really love (Who do you love)

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love

Who do you love

// How About A Little Love //

Feeling alone isn't my kind of thing
No, I don't like being alone
So, why don't you come love me?
Oh baby, let's get it off

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?
Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?

Looking straight in your direction
Baby, I've got my eyes on you
Look at me baby, look and see
Are you lonely, got nothing to do?

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?
Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?

La-da-da-da, la-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh (set sail, set sail)
How about a little love?

// I Will Love You Tomorrow //

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

You're the one that I've been dreaming of
You're the one I want to give my love
Everyday I want you more and more
Baby, please, open up your door (I will love)

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

When you're near me, can't you hear my heart?
Sending out the message to never part
Please, don't leave me now, I need you so
If you love me now I'll never go (I will love)

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today
