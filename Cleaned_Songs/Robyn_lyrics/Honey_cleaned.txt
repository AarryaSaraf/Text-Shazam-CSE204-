Album: Honey

// Missing U //

Baby, it's so weird to me now that it's over
The space where you used to be
Your head on my shoulder
All of the plans we made that never happened
Now your scent on my pillow's faded
At least you left me with something

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through a waste of time
But the picture's incomplete
There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through a waste of time
But the picture's incomplete
'Cause I'm missing you
I miss you

Can't make sense of all of the pieces
Or my own delusions
Can't take all these memories
Don't know how to use 'em
There's a slick washed up onto the beach
I follow the traces
Finding clues in my pockets and opening boxes
And going places we went, remember to forget
Thinking how you have been
I turn all my sorrow into glass
But don't leave no shatter

There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through a waste of time
But the picture's incomplete
There's this empty space you left behind
Now you're not here with me
I keep digging through a waste of time
But the picture's incomplete
'Cause I'm missing you
I miss you

(I miss you)
This part of you
This clock that stopped
This residue
It's all I've got
(I miss you)
This part of you
This clock that stopped
(Clock that stopped)
This residue
(It's all I got)
It's all I've got

There's this empty space you left behind
(This part of you
This clock that stopped)
I keep thinking you're still right beside me
(This residue
It's all I got)
You're still there
There's this empty space you left behind
(This part of you
This clock that stopped)
All the love you gave, it still defines me
(There's this empty space you left behind
I keep thinking you're still right beside me
There's this empty space you left behind
I keep thinking you're still right beside me
There's this empty space you left behind
All the love you gave, it still defines me)

// Human Being //

I'm a human being
And so are you
My heart can't stop beating
Don't know what to do

I'm a human being
I'm a human being

Where to go
The streets are so cold
Stay in my arms
Dance with me

I'm a human being
(Move your body closer to mine)
(Move your)
(Move your)
(Move your body)
Don't be afraid
One step at a time
(Move your body)
I'm a human being
(Baby don't give up on me now)
I'm a human being

There's no resolution
No honey gold
There's no final union
There's no control, mmm
All these emotions are out of date
I know it's hard
No peace of mind, but don't shut me out
You know we're the same kind
A dying race

I'm a human being
(I'm a human being)
(I'm a human being)
I'm a human being

(Move your body)
(Move your)
(Move your)
Move your body
Move your body closer to mine
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
(I'm a human being)
Don't be afraid
One step at a time
Baby
Baby, don't give up on me now

I'm a human being
Baby, don't give up on me now
(Move your body, babe)
(Move your)
It's alright
(Move your)
(Move your)
(Move your body)
Don't give up on me now

// Because It's In The Music //

They wrote a song about us
It's called something like stardust
And on that day they released it
Saying they'll release me
Even though it kills me
I still play it anyway

Because it's in the music
Yeah, we were dancing to it
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry
Because it's in the music
Heavenly bodies moving
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry

It's time we heard it together
You know I'll always remember
I remember feeling like
This is never gonna end
Nothing lasts forever
Not the sweet, not the bitter
It's a tired old record
I still play it anyway

Because it's in the music
Yeah, we were dancing to it
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry
Because it's in the music
Heavenly bodies moving, yeah
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry

And I wonder when you hear it
Are you getting that same feeling?
Like you wanna break down in hell
I keep playing it anyway
Anyway, anyway
Anyway, yeah, oh oh oh
I still play it anyway

Because it's in the music
Yeah, we were dancing to it
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry
Because it's in the music
Heavenly bodies moving, yeah
I'm right back in that moment
And it makes me want to cry

// Baby Forgive Me //

Here come the night
In your eyes
Baby, be brave
Be wise
It's up to you
You do what you like, mmm
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try

Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me

(Won't you give it a chance, baby?)
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try
One more try
Yeah, eh

You got the power
You set the price
But baby, be fair
Be nice
You say you want to be happy
Then you got to put your love on the line
Just let me make you smile again, baby
I know we can work it out
Yes, I know we can

Baby forgive me
Yeah
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me

// Send To Robin Immediately //

Baby forgive me, mmm

If you got something to say

Say it and mean it, baby
Say it and mean it, baby

If you got something to say, say it right away
If you got something to do, do what's right for you
If you got somebody to love, give that love today
Know you got nothing to lose, there's no time to waste
If you got a letter for me, send it right away
If you know that you really care, don't hold your breath
If you want the gold and the honey, come get it right away
Baby, come get it right away
If you got something to say (say it and mean it, baby)

// Honey //

No, you're not gonna get what you need
Baby, I have what you want
Come get your honey
No, you're not gonna get what you need
But baby, I have what you want
Come get your honey
I got your honey, baby

Every colour and every taste
Every breath that whispers your name
It's like emeralds on the pavement
Every colour and every taste
Every breath that whispers your name
It's like emeralds on the pavement
I got your honey, baby
At the heart of some kind of flower
Stuck in glitter, strands of saliva
Won't you get me right where the hurt is?
At the heart of some kind of flower
Stuck in glitter, strands of saliva
Won't you get me right where the hurt is?

And the waves come in and they're golden
But down in the deep the honey is sweeter
(Ooh, it is sweeter, baby)
And the sun sets on the water
But down in the deep the current is stronger
Oh, yeah

No, you're not gonna get what you need
But baby, I have what you want
Come get your honey
No, you're not gonna get what you need (what you need)
But baby, I have what you want (what you want)
Come get your honey
I got your honey, baby

Can you open up to the pleasure?
Suck it up inside like a treasure
Let the brighter place be your passion
Can you open up to the pleasure?
Suck it up inside like a treasure
Let the brighter place be your passion
I got your honey, baby
Let go of your doubt, say yes
Let it soak up into the flesh
Never had this kind of nutrition
Let go of your doubts, say yes
Let it soak up into the flesh
Never had this kind of nutrition

And the waves come in and they're golden
But down in the deep the honey is sweeter (sweeter, yeah, yeah)
And the sun sets on the water
But down in the deep the current is stronger (deep, baby)
Ooh, it's stronger

No, you're not gonna get what you need
Baby, I have what you want
Come get your honey (I have what you want)
No, you're not gonna get what you need (get what you need)
Baby, I have what you want (what you want)
Come get your honey, baby (I have what you want)
No, you're not gonna get what you need (get what you need)
But I have what you want
And you know that I got it for you, baby
Baby, I have what you want
Ooh, come get your honey, baby
Baby, I have what you want
Come get it, baby

// Between The Lines //

Even reading in between the lines

Every day, you hit my phone up
Every time
(You hit my phone up)
It makes my heart jump
I want you to say it, baby
(It makes my heart jump)
Say it like you mean it
It's right there on the tip of your tongue
(You hit my phone up)
And I can feel it
And I like it baby
Don't you stop
(Don't stop what you're doing, baby)
You know I like it
You stretch it out
(You know I like it)
You give massages
It's not your words
(You know I like it)
It's what's in between them
There's no need to spell out
(It makes my heart jump)
I know you want it
And I like it baby

I'm reading in between the lines
I'm reading in between the lines
(You got me reading in between the lines)
I'm reading in between the lines
(Even reading in between the lines)
I'm reading in between the lines
(You got me reading in between the lines)
And I like it, baby
And I like it, baby
(Even reading in between the lines)

I don't mind
(i don't really mind it baby)
When we get silent
Pressure's rising, it's so intense
(When we get silent)
We're making diamonds
There's no need to say it baby
(We're making diamonds)
'Cause I can tell you mean it
All over the tip of your tongue
(We're making diamonds)
You got me spaced out
And I like it, baby

I'm reading in between the lines
I'm reading in between the lines
(You got me reading in between the lines)
I'm reading in between the lines
(Even reading in between the lines)
I'm reading in between the lines
(You got me reading in between the lines)
And I like it, baby
And I like it, baby
(Even reading in between the lines)

And I like it, baby
And I like it
And I like it, baby
And I like it
(Relax)
(That's amazing)
You got me reading in between the lines
(That shit's so good)
(Relax)
You got me reading in between the lines
(Amazing)

// Ever Again //

Come on, let's have it out
Go 'head and try a little crazy on me
You don't have to worry
About the pulling and pushing away
We never used to get it right
So baby, alright for getting started
But that's not how it's gonna be
That shit's out the door
That shit's out the door

Never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again
(That shit's out the door)
I'm only gonna sing about love
Ever again
Never gonna let it happen
Then it won't be all for nothing
Oh, I swear I'm never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again

Come on, let's have it out
I just want you to be able to be yourself
There's nothing to worry about
How 'bout we stop arguing and do something else?
So many things we haven't tried
Baby, you know we're just getting started
Daddy issues and silly games
That shit got so lame
That shit got so lame

Never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again
(That shit's out the door)
I'm only gonna sing about love
Ever again
(Never ever gonna be brokenhearted, baby)
Never gonna let it happen
Then it won't be all for nothing
Oh, I swear I'm never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again

Come on, let's have it out
(Never gonna be brokenhearted)
Come on, let's have it out
(Never gonna be brokenhearted)
Come on, let's have it out
(Never gonna be brokenhearted)

You know you can trust me, right?
Come on, let's have it out
(Only gonna sing about love ever again)
Come on, let's have it out
Come on, let's have it out
You can trust me, babe
It ain't ever gonna be that way again

Never gonna let it happen
(No baby, never)
Then it won't be all for nothing
Oh, I swear I'm never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again
Never gonna be brokenhearted
Ever again
(Never, never, ever)
I'm only gonna sing about love
Ever again
(Trust me, trust me)
Never gonna let it happen
