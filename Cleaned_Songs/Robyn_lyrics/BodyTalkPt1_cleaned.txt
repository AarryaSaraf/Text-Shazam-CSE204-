// Cry When You Get Older //

Hey girl in the strobing light

What your mama never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older

Young boy by the traffic light

What your daddy never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older


Hold up a second, now I got something on my dirty mind

I start out with good intentions but mess it up like all the time

I try to keep up appearance but always end up way out of line

I need some kind of miracle, cause I lost all my faith in science

So I put my faith in me


She said: "There just must be more to life than this"

He said: "Careful, cause you might just get your wish"


Hey girl in the strobing light

What your mama never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older

Young boy by the traffic light

What your daddy never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older


Back in suburbia kids get high and make out on the train

Then endless incomprehensible boredom takes a hold again

And in this other dream I'm on top of the world, ahead of the game

Think of reality and it hits me hardcore to the brain

We've got to get away


She said: "There just must be more to life than this"

He said: "Careful, cause you might just get your wish"


Hey girl in the strobing light

What your mama never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older

Young boy by the traffic light

What your daddy never told you

Is love hurts when you do it right

You can cry when you get older


Bet your mama never told you that

// Hang With Me (Acoustic Version) //

Will you tell me once again

How we're gonna be just friends?

If you're for real and not pretend

Then I guess you can hang with me


When my patience's wearing thin

When I'm ready to give in

Will you pick me up again?

Then I guess you can hang with me


And if you do me right

I'm gonna do right by you

And if you keep it tight

I'm gonna confide in you

I know what's on your mind

There will be time for that too

If you hang with me

Hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree


Oh, you can hang with me


When you see me drift astray

Outta touch and outta place

Will you tell me to my face?

Then I guess you can hang with me


And if you do me right

I'm gonna do right by you

And if you keep it tight

I'm gonna confide in you

I know what's on your mind

There will be time for that too

If you hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree you can hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree


Oh, you can hang with me

Hang with me

// Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa //

Jag vet en dejlig rosa och vit som liljeblad
När jag på henne tänker så görs mitt hjärta glad
Dess stämma ger en hjärtans tröst
Lik näktergalens blida röst
Så fager och så ljuv

Som solen fagert skiner är hon som purpur klar
Gud låt dig aldrig sörja men alltid vara glad
Må de få komma samman
Med hjärtans fröjd och gamman
Som längta till varann

Var dag går solen neder och dagelig uppgår
När kommer dagen blider att jag dig skåda får
I hågen är du jämt mig när
Farväl, farväl min hjärtans kär
MÃ¥ngtusende godnatt
