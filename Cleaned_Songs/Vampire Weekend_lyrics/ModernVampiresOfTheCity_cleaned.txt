// Obvious Bicycle //

Morning's come, you watch the red sun rise
The LED still flickers in your eyes
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one's gonna spare their time for you
No one's gonna watch you as you go
From a house you didn't build and can't control
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one's gonna spare their time for you
You ought to spare the world your labor
It's been twenty years and no one's told the truth

So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don't wait
Don't wait
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don't wait
Don't wait

So keep that list of who to thank in mind
And don't forget the rich ones who were kind
Oh, you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one's gonna spare their time for you
Why don't you spare their world a traitor?
Take your wager back and leave before you lose

So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don't wait
Don't wait

So while the sun's coming out
Cover ground, cover ground
And if you find some love for these clowns
Turn around, turn around
I'll be half-asleep on the floor of a high school gym
Thinking of you and wondering if anyone else could begin

To listen
Listen
Don't wait
Don't wait

So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don't wait
Don't wait

// Unbelievers //

Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's gonna save a little warmth for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

If I'm born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who's gonna say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

See the sun go down
It's going on down, and the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's gonna save a little light for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

I know I love you
And you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

// Step //

Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet

Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

// Diane Young //

You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go 'til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go a little long on your own for a bit

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it's a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it's a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it's a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it's a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Nobody knows what the future holds
And it's bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, 'cause I hate suspense

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

// Don't Lie //

One look sent knees to the ground
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound
So hold me close, my baby

Don't lie, I want him to know
God's loves die young, is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

Young turks, young Saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames, they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby

Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings, and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know

Don't lie, I want 'em to know
God's love die young, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
'Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold

I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know

// Hannah Hunt //

A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

// Everlasting Arms //

I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself

Oh, I was made to live without you
But I'm never gonna understand, never understand
Oh, I was born to live without you
But I'm never gonna understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That's going down

I thought it over and drew the curtain
Lead me to my cell, lead me to my cell
I hummed the Dies Irae as you played the Hallelujah
Lead me to my cell, don't leave me in my cell

If you'd been made to serve a master
You'd be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master?
Well, I'm never gonna understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That's going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That's going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms

// Finger Back //

Bend my finger back, snap! Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

Bless me with a heart attack, a real crise cardiaque
And show me where to find the surgeon's knife
Eviscerate me now, hack! Take me to my punishment
The punishment I needed all my life
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on with strife
Listen to my bum rap, listen to the evidence
Exonerating me from being right

It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

You know that I've been wicked and the road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you're not anybody's fool

Bend my finger back, snap! Pack it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

The harpsichord is broken and the television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool

Sing "Next Year in Jerusalem"
You know, the one at 103rd and Broadway?
'Cause this Orthodox girl fell in love
With the guy at the falafel shop
And why not? Should she have averted her eyes
And just stared at the laminated poster of the Dome of the Rock?

And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood

Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die
Condolences to gentle hearts who couldn't bear to try
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

// Worship You //

Energetic praise You wanted
Any kind of praise You wanted

// Ya Hey //

Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love You
And Babylon don't love You
But You love everything
Oh, You saint
America don't love You
So I could never love You
In spite of everything

In the dark of this place
There's the glow of Your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

Oh, the motherland don't love You
The fatherland don't love You
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless, they don't love You
The zealous hearts don't love You
And that's not gonna change

All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel
That You seen the mistakes
But You let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
You say, "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

Outside the tents
On the festival grounds
As the air began to cool
And the sun went down
My soul swooned
As I faintly heard the sound
Of You spinning "Israelites"
Into "19th Nervous Breakdown"

Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am what I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

// Hudson //

Hudson died in Hudson Bay
The water took its victim's name
Now river's rise told Riverside
To change their names again

A stranger walked in through the door
Said, "All apartments are pre-war"
We laughed and asked him for his name
He stayed until the end
We watched the Germans play the Greeks
We marked the 99-year lease
Our fathers signed
Which I declined to try and comprehend

Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

The legendary wooden gate
The first established real estate
Is lost in time like all the crimes
That won this pleasant land (land, land, land)

Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

Hudson died on Hudson Bay
But I was born on Sutton Place
The rising tide helped me decide
To change my name again
Some men tend to linger on
And some make haste from Babylon
Some will roam their ruined home
Rejoicing 'til the end

Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come, the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

The lines are drawn, the map is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

// Young Lion //

You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
