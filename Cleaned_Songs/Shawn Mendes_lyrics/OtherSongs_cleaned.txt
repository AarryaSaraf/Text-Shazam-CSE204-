// Add It Up //

Day after day, I will walk and I will play
But the day after today, I will stop and I will start

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose and things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says, "Wait a minute, honey, I'ma add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey I'ma add it up

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight

Oh, mama mama mama-mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and you got him a gun

So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know that you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight
Add it up, add it up
Wait a minute honey I'ma add it up

// All We Got //

And we back
And we back
And we back

And we back
And we back
And we back

This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé

Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll probably cry at my own service

Cause it was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third

This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got (yeah)
This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got

I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
Doesn't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got

// Believe //

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [8x]

Everest is only a mountain
A pyramid is just a shape
Doesn't have to hold you back
Doesn't have to pin you down

Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true
Everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Don't be afraid to be who you are
Just scream out and shout and follow the stars
Forget about the past that it's over
We are the young ones our way is forward

Who keeps tabs on stupid mistakes?
We all mess up but that's just the way
We learn how to get back up
We learn how to turn the page

So we will let our dreams take flight
And our hearts ignite

Did you know that it's true
Everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]

Let your dreams take flight
And your heart ignite

Did you know that it's true
That everything is possible
There's nothing we can't do
It's a wild and beautiful fire
And I believe in you

I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe, hey [4x]
And I believe in you

// Carried Away //

We had nights of endless music
We were dizzy dancing 'til the dawn
We were free, singing sweet harmonies with the city
But maybe that was someone else's song

Back to Earth again
You knew where this was headed and honestly you're better off
Better here where you belong

You got caught up in the colors
You got wrapped up in the ride
You thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on your side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
Still, you let yourself get carried away
I guess I let myself get carried away

We got carried away, carried away
Got carried away, carried away

So we got mixed up in the madness
But wasn't it a perfect mess we made?
Well you live and you learn, you read signs and it's safe and it's simple
And behind our walls we fall back into place

Back to Earth again
You're through with pretending 'cause this is how the ending goes
Now you're here where you belong

We got caught up in the colors
We got wrapped up in the ride
We thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on our side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
We just let ourselves get carried away

We got carried away, carried away
Got carried away, carried away
Carried away (Lost in the fantasy), carried away (Of all we were gonna be)
Carried away, carried away

It was lovely while it lasted
It was never meant to stay
But we let ourselves get carried away
I guess I let myself get carried away

// Cold In California //

Oh
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving and might never come back
Hmm, I was dreaming of a warmer place
And if I made it, it'd be okay

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

All those dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like nothing, cause I wasn't with you
And tell me what that means
And tell me why I'm dying
Thought this was what I needed
But that was a mistake

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, And I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving, now I wanna come back

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California

The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California, yeah
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California

// Different Kind Of Love //

Guess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L.A
And we could wait too long
But it's never too late

And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change

We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense

And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change

We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love

We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love

// Eye Of The Storm //

This morning I was listening to your heartbeat singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad

And darling, I know that it's dark
But you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm

This morning I was listening to your heartbeat singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad

And darling, I know that it's dark
But you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side
In the eye of the storm

// Heartbeat //

I look into the stars at night
The only substitution when it's not your eyes, yeah
Can't get enough, it's official
I want a lot and not a little
If we keep it us it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Twenty minutes till I'm home
And tell me all the ways you wanna make this go
No, I can't get enough now, it's official
You want a lot and not a little
If we keep it us it's so simple
Wherever you are, wherever you are

Heartbeat, it speeds up whenever you
Want me, what you got, I want it like
All week, I need that, I wanna be
Wherever you are, wherever you are

// Here //

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
And truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a girlfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner waiting for this to be over
With this girl who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta he-

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we just kick it and just listen
To some music with the message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with this girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to this boy who's throwing up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be this way
So tell my people that I'm ready when their ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

And I'll be over here
No I'll be over here
No I'll be over here

// I Don't Even Know Your Name, Aftertaste, Kid In Love & I Want You Back (Live Medley) //

Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know what we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate

I was like oh you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out, yeah
But you don't have to do anything else, but be yourself, oh (Clap those hands)
Oh you dressed up so nice, but all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Woah-woah, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day, no no no
Cause I don't even know your name
No, I don't even know your name, no

(You guys felling good out there? Amazing, you look incredible!
I got this little sing along part for you, just repeat after me)

I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Sing that out for me)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(A little louder now sing it out)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Sing it out now)
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even
(Scream it)
I don't even, I don't even– and I—

I'm running I'm searching and I don't know where to start
I'm dying my love you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking till I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running I'm running I'm running
I'm running I'm searching baby
(Sing it out)
I'm dying my love you punched a hole right through my heart, no

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
And I'll help you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory in the aftertaste

(This is kid in love everybody sing it with me!)

I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it's all right, it's all right I wanna make you mine
The way you lighten up the room
Got the corner of my eye
We could both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
Cause it's all right, it's all right I wanna make you mine yeah-yeah

(Alright New York City sing this as loud as you can, here we go!)

Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up

Cause I've got it all
(Wave those hands)
I've got it all, yeah
But I don't ever want to grow up
I've got it all
I've got it all, no no na na
I don't ever want to grow up

Cause you make me feel like I've got it all, yeah
And you make me feel, yeah
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel, baby
Like I've got it all, no no
No you make me feel, yeah
Like I was just a kid in love

And I was singing oh baby give me one more chance, yeah
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
Now since I see you
You, in his arms

You got me singing like
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love then I don't ever want to grow up
(Scream it!)
Maybe I'm just a kid in love, maybe I'm just a kid in love oh baby
If this is what it's like falling in love we don't ever have to grow up

Cause I've got it all, yeah yeah yeah

We don't ever have to grow up

// In My Blood (Portuguese Version) //

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
O sonho que trago comigo
Se acredita sonho contigo
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar

Que vamos conseguir
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar, oh

It isn't in my blood
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração
It isn't in my blood

// It'll Be Okay //

Are we gonna make it?
Is this gonna hurt?
Oh, we can try to sedate it
But that never works
Yeah

I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
It's making me sick but we'll heal and the sun will rise

If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay
If we can't stop the bleeding
We don't have to fix it, we don't have to stay
I will love you either way
Ooh-ooh, it'll be oh, be okay
Ooh-ooh

Oh, the future we dreamed of is fading to black
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, there's nothing more painful
Nothing more painful, oh-woah (Oh-woah)

I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
And it's making me sick but we'll heal and the sun will rise

If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay (It'll be okay)
And if we can't stop the bleeding
We don't have to fix it, we don't have to stay (Don't have to stay)
I will love you either way
Ooh-ooh, it'll be oh, be okay
Ooh-ooh

I will love you either way
It might be so sweet
It might be so bitter
I will love you either way
It might be so sweet
It might be so bitter (Ooh-ooh)

Oh, if the future we've dreamed of is fading to black
I will love you either way

La Tribu

// Lost In Japan (Remix) //

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Oh, oh

I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Oh, oh

I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight, oh)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

// Love Me Or Leave Me //

Can I open my mouth and let the words come spilling now?
Show you the side of me that I hadn't figured out
And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?
Cause I want you to be there
Yeah, I want you to be there

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

Could you talk to the night if I told you I never sleep?
Could you be the air in my lungs when I can't breathe?
And sometimes when I quite as strong as I wanna be
Swear I want you to be there
Be there, be there

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, oh
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, oh, oh

If I told you my secrets
And I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts
And showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?

Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?
Love me or leave me?

// Moving Too Fast //

Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

And you say oh no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train
Slow, slow the lights turning red

But I say no no
Whatever I do
I barrel on though
And I don't complain
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead

I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just half assed
But with the states getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me
Things might get brumby but some people analyze every detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on

Some people can't get success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on

And oh, maybe I can't follow through
But oh, what else am I supposed to do?

I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war
I met my personal Aphrodite
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before

We start to take the next step together
Found an apartment on seventy-third
The Atlantic Mounthly's printing my first chapter
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word

I left Columbia and I don't regret it
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it
My heart's been stolen
My ego's rolling
I just keep rollin' along...

And I think
Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more before twenty-four
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control

I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast

// Never Be Alone & Hey There Delilah (Live Medley) //

Woah...
(New York City sing that out)
Woah...

I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you sound

Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

But hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now, yeah

(Sing it out)

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone, oh
Woah...

You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight just remember that we lay under the same stars

And hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
But I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone [x2]

Woah...

Hey there Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right here if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes

Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
(Sing!)
Oh it's what you do to me [x4]

(Stay with me)
Woah...
(Can you guys clap your hands along to that)
Woah...
(Do not stop clapping, whatever you do keep on clapping..)
(The goal here is to get every single person in this arena
To sing this as loud as they can. Can we do that?)
(New York, if there's any city in the world that can do that it's you guys so.. let's do it)
(Keep on clapping, alright here we go)

Woah...
(Beautiful keep on going!)
Woah...
(You sound absolutely incredible right now! Keep on going sing it!)
(Woah...)
Woah-ah, yeah
(Sing it out)
Woah...
(This last one is all you guys, all yours, sing)
Woah...

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
Never be alone. (Oh, yeah)
You'll never be alone

(I love you guys, thank you so much)

// Never Let Me Go //

I'm...
Making my way down this road,
Feel the chill to the road,
And I can barely see the lights,
Wonder if she'll be here tonight.

When I see her in my dreams,
There's flowers blooming these are the tree's,
Been searching for so long, yeah,
I think it's bout time that I found this girl.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me gooo.

Life will pass you by so quick,
I didn't know it but my line is growing thick,
And now I think I found the one, yeah,
That I've been searching for so long.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me gooo.

Just push the roads aside,
Wanted to see you smile,
And now I'm feeling so strong,
Done walking down this road,
Got what I want.

And you're coming with me.

And if you come with me,
Promise you'll never leave,
I'm never gonna let you gooo.

Let me take you home,
I'll be the one you want,
You'll never wanna see me go.
[x2]

// Rip Up The Recipe //

When you're cookin' somethin' up
And only tryin' the tried and true
You stick to the predictable you've known
Measure out the same amounts
Every teaspoon, every ounce
No surprises when the rules are set in stone

But when the sugar hits the fan
You make a mess of your perfect plan
And you're facin' the face of somethin' strange and new
If it's not what you had prepared
In the scramble, you can't get scared
Let somethin' wild and wonderful break through

Start rippin' up the recipe
Let go of how it has to be
You forget about right and wrong
When you lose yourself in the song
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Livin' life inside the lines safe and simple, by the book
You keep sweepin' the uncertainty aside
But an unfamiliar spice might bring somethin' extra nice
Somethin' twice as good as what you woulda tried

'Cause when the sugar hits the fan
You make a mess of your perfect plan
And you're facin' the face of somethin' strange and new
Somethin's ready to wreck your day
You can pray that it goes away
Or let somethin' wild and wonderful break through

Start rippin' up the recipe
Let go of how it has to be
No, you can't plan it in advance
Gotta lose yourself in the dance
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Start rippin' up the recipe
And make a little mess with me
You forget about right and wrong
When you lose yourself in the song
It's perfect unexpectedly
When you rip up the recipe

Doot-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo-doo
Doot-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

// Satisfied //

Please don't tell me that he's just a friend
Don't you touch me and act all innocent
'Cause when you're sitting on my bed
And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

It doesn't make it any better
When you say, "It's not my fault"
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all

And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied

// Stitches (Seeb Remix) //

Ble, bleed over myself...

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore 
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Bleed over my
Ble, bleed over my
Ble, bleed over myself
I'll be needing stitches 
Bleed over my
Ble, bleed over my
Ble, bleed over myself
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Bleed over my
Ble, bleed over my,
Ble, bleed over myself 
I'll be needing stitches 
Bleed over my
Ble, bleed over my
Ble, bleed over myself

// Summer Of Love //

Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow
Tangled in the sheets until the evening there was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other shapes
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Kisses on your body in my memory baby nothing comes close

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love

Meditation and tequila
Calling you my senorita
Didn't know how much I need ya
Hate it when I have to leave ya
I've been taking mental pictures
For when I miss you in the winter
Staying up until the sunrise
Praying it won't be the last time

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love

Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow, yeah
Entangled in the sheets until the evening there was nowhere to go, no

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La, la, love
La, la, love, yeah

// Summertime Sadness //

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

She's got her red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty queen style
High heels off, feelin' allive

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
If I die tonight, I'll be alright

And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

Summertime sadness...

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness, yeah

// Sure Of Myself //

I've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher, in rain

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

And if I've lost my way (how am I still here)
Still standing straight (how am I still here)
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)
Sure of myself (self)

Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reasons to give all my love
Making it okay to let go

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Because when I was little I was so sure of myself

When I was little I was so sure of myself (yeah)
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
When I was little I was so sure of myself (oh)

// Sweater Weather //

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use my sleeves as a sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts

She knows what I think about
What I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no mouths
Just us, you find out
I don't even really wanna talk about, no

'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now I let you hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

If I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides your mind
So move to a place so far away
Goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand touch your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everybody knows what the beat is for
Outside it pours
Inside is warm
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
And I don't even really wanna talk about
No no no

'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now I let you hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Cold whoa
For you here
And now I let you hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

// Take A Look At Us Now //

You can pack your bags and start skipping town
Hang up your hat when the show shuts down
But when the world says you ain't quite world-renowned
Don't count yourself out yet

When you hit that lonely and lowest low
Well, up's the only way left to go
You're meant to reinvent the show
So ain't you glad we met?

Turn that dull and dusty solo
To a dazzling duet

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

We started pretty small
But take a look at us now

Take a look at us now

Suddenly standing ten feet tall
Take a look at us now

Take a look at us now

Though we have no way to stay afloat
We were scared and saying "That's all she wrote"
We're ending on a sky-high note
Somehow
Buddy, you were all it took
So take a look at us now

When that perfect plan's going off the rails
A heap of trouble is on our tails
It's time to polish up those scales
And give it all you've got

If you're out of step

If you're out of sync

If you care too much what those critics think
Well, when you find your missing link
Don't give it a second thought
'Cause in the center of the spotlight
We just might have found our spot

Finding our luck with every leap
Take a look at us now
Take a look at us now
The road could be scared, it could be steep
Take a look at us now
Take a look at us now
Though we might look sun at first glance
Who'da thunk that we had a chance
Our life could be a song and dance
Somehow

Buddy, you were all it took

So take a look at us now

So even when you're terrified
Just find a smile a mile wide
'Cause bud, when you and I collide
Standing side by side
We're gonna take a great big bow
Would you take a look at us now?

Give us a spotlight and a crowd
Take a look at us now
Ready to sing our song out loud
Take a look at us now
Won't you take a look at us
Take a look at us
Take a look at us now
