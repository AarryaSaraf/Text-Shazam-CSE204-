// Keep Me Cryin' //

You keep me crying all the time
I have to say that you
Keep me crying all the time

Well, I tried to play my music
But my music was too loud
Well, I pleased all the people
But I couldn't please the crowd

And I dropped down on my knees
And said, hey, mama
Won't you clear my head
Don't you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Oh, Lord, don't you know they
They keep me moaning all the time
They keep me burning all the time

Well, I tried
To run my business
But they said I can't
Just keep it to myself
Not bothering any man

Just as sure as I try
Cause my tears in my eye
Don't you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Friends knocking in my door
They keep me crying
Somebody calling on the phone and
They keep me crying...

// Smile A Little Bit More //

Don't let it get you down, Lord

I smile and my heart disappears
Oh, smile and move your burning feet

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
Hey, we just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

A tear can bring such rapid pain, yeah
Our turn to see the winds change

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
All you gotta do just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

A friend of mine said, in my heart I see the winter
Making me a little older, but I, I don't mind

I just smile a little bit more a little bit more
He said that to me, I just smiled a little bit more, a little bit more

Told the band, play the song
Told the band, play the song

Ring the bell 'cause there's something to say
Happiness, you sure my simple things

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
All you've gotta do is just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
If your troubles get you down, you just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

// I Tried To Tell Myself //

I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)
I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)

Oh, though you said you would
I only wish you could
I know I'm trying to be someone

Say I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You got to ride
(You got to ride)
Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried
I really tired to sleep at night
(Sleep at night)

Before the break of day
Turning another page into life's mystery

And the light of day
I can now hear you say
I then take this trip
With me to eternity

Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You need a friend
(You need a friend)
Oh and as soon as I wake up
The sun begin to shine, I start to rain
(Start to rain)

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
I, I could be with you

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
Now I wanna be with you, oh yeah

I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't wanna ever leave you
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me all alone

I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me away
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't want you to ever leave me all alone

// Something //

Something gotta hold on me
Something gotta hold on me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something is bothering me
(Softly)
Something kinda worrying me
Whatever it is
I can't leave it alone, no

Something in that cloud in the sky
Something
Do you feel it passing by?
Whatever it is
Makes me wonder why
Sometimes I sit here and wonder why
Makes me wonder
Birds that fly in the sky
Wonder... They wonder why
Everyday, seasons passing by makes me..
I wonder why
Sometime in the evening it makes me sad

// The Truth Marches On //

The truth marches on
Of all the wrong I've done
Sometimes we stop, say hello
Too much has gone on and on and on

You know, the truth, he is not a young man
But he's old, of his time, he stays on your mind

The truth marches on and on and on
The truth marches on and on and on

Let the light shine on
Through the rain and the storm
Sometimes a day is nothing but wrong
But the light shines on, on and on and on
You know the truth, stopping to do what is right
Stay for the night

The truth marches on and on and on
The truth marches on and on and on

Gone in the day, shines at night
Another time you were right
Another smile on your face
I live for it, sweet every day

The truth marches on
The truth marches on
The truth marches on
Like a soldier
Like a soldier, yeah
The truth marches on

// Have A Good Time //

Let's have a real good time, yeah, yeah
Some people don't know what it means
To have a real, real good time

Say it son, see I remember long time ago, yeah
My mother told me, she said son, son
She said son, son, son no matter where you go
Try to have yourself a real, real good time

So I thought tonight would be a fine time
For you and I to get together
And clap your hand like this
One, two, three, four

Have a real good time, have a real
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time
Hey, let's have a good time, one time
Hey, let's have a good time, c'mon

We gonna laugh 'n' shout trouble's over
All the bad dreams will be comin' up in clover
And we gonna sing with the heavenly choir
Say hello never say bye bye

We'll have a good time, no, let's have a good time
We'll have a real good time, let's have a good time
No, let's have a good time

Let us hearts be workin' together
Let our souls be singin' together
Let our love be what we're prayin' for

Oh, let me say one thing
I can see our destiny yeah right up ahead and
Right up ahead in front of me, yeah but
Rise up now, freedom now will set you free
Clap your hands with me

Have a good time, have a good time
Everybody have a good time
I am myself, have a good time

Let me feel it, have a good time
Have a good time
Everybody supposed to let it free
Have a good time

Have a good time, have a good time
Everybody in the studio, have a good time
Have a good time

// Nothing Takes The Place Of You //

I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And I still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you

I, I write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
I, I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same

So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you.

// Happy //

I'm happy, I can see
My eyes are wide open, and what a relief
Baby girl, I'm happy about you and me
Words are all spoken for ecstasy, yeah

Out of a bright cloudy sky
The sun came out and dried my eyes
Now that's the world to me, yeah
Yeah, open your eyes, son, show you can see, yeah

I'm happy, it's another day
It's you and me, mama send it on home to me
It's satisfying, I'm relyin'
I'm happy, got me cryin'

Yeah, I'm happy
It's another day, yeah
Tell you, I've found it, like they used to say
Finally I can see my way, Lord

Well, I'm happy
Say it once again, yeah
Say I found myself a love
I found a friend, yeah

What more can I say, yeah?
Except that only yesterday
There's no sorrow
Just hope for tomorrow
