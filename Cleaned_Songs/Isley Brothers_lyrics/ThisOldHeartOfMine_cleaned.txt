// Nowhere To Run //

Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
I got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

It's not love, I'm running from
It's the heartaches, I know will come
'Cause I know, you're no good for me
But you've become a part of me

Everywhere I go, your face I see
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah

Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me, now
But free of you I'll never be, no
Each night as I sleep into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you, hoping soon that I'll forget you

When I look in the mirror and comb my hair
I see your face just a-smiling there

Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But free of you, I'll never be
How can I fight a lover that's sugar sweet
When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me

My love reaches so high, you can't get over it
So wide, you can't get around, no

Nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run, baby nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be

Nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run

// Stop! In The Name Of Love //

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over) After I've been good to you?
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name of Love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever

Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In The Name Of Love
Before you break my heart

// This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You) //

Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin'
'Cause my head starts spinnin'

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you (Darling, I'm)
I love you (Weak for you)
This old heart (Darling, I'm), darling, is weak for you (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), yes, I do (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), darling (Mad about you)

// Take Some Time Out For Love //

If your baby lives away across town
(Away across town)
And the hustle and bustle of life
Keeps getting you down
(Keeps getting you down)

Just take some time out
(Take some time out baby)
Ahhh take some time out

Yeah no matter what you're doing, yeah yeah

If your hands are tied
And you just can't get them free (get them free)
'Cause your old folks boss
Won't show you no sympathy (show you no sympathy)

And baby come running in a hurry

// I Guess I'll Always Love You //

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

Open up your arms (Open up your arms)
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart (Open up your heart)
And let me live again
When you left, you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live in the shadows of our past
With this love that was born to last

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

The only time I'm happy (The only time I'm happy)
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
More of the love to you I give
I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do (No matter what I do)
I'm always dreaming of you

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

Every girl that passes by
I see your sparkle in her eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there
Whenever I feel almost free
Old memories start taking hold of me
I love you now so much more
Than I ever did before

I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you

// Baby Don't You Do It //

Well, baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't break my heart

Well, I sacrifice to make you happy
Kept nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I need you, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on

But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

Well, my biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass, then you would surely see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me
But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best

But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see about me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart baby; can't you see I need you?
Can't go on without you; I'm no good without you
Life's no good without you, what I'm gonna do without you?
Hey, baby don't do it, oh, don't break my heart
Oh, don't you do it, don't break my heart
Life's no good without you
What I'm gonna do without you?
Can't go on without you
Life's no good without you
Oh, don't do it baby, yeah
Hey, don't you do it

// Who Could Ever Doubt My Love //

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been falsely accused
Of being untrue to him
And it's not so
But it's the way he's misjudged me
That really hurts me so
When I've been nothing but good to him
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to him
Who could ever doubt my love?

A victim of circumstance I have been
But what really hurts is
Instead of believing me
He believed his friends
When I've been nothing but good to him

Rearrange my life to please only him
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

I've been cast aside
Because he believed someone's lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to him
Good to him, so good to him

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

// Put Yourself In My Place //

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

// I Hear A Symphony //

You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting
Whenever you are near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms

Then suddenly, ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Whenever you are near, I hear a symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine, my baby
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself but for those
Who've never felt this joy we've felt now
Babe, whenever you are near

I hear a symphony each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me
Whispering how much you care

A thousand violins fill the air now
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh, so close to me, baby, baby

Baby, baby, I hear a symphony placed with a tenderly
Ooh, so tenderly
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't let this moment end, you standing close to me
Ooh

// Just Ain't Enough Love //

"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
Because, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But I heard her say as she walked away

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

// There's No Love Left //

A love gone bad is a heartbreaking pain
Like a chilling cold in the midst of spring
That last goodbye brings a flow of tears
Oh, it hurts to lose someone you held dear

Might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

I kissed her cheek, and sadly walked away
The words haunted me every step of the way
Wondering "Can I go on?" without her affections
As I slowly walk in some strange direction

Wondering "What am I gonna do? Where can I go?"
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

Simply I ask, give our love another chance
But she said our love is in the past
The words kept ringing in my ear
I cannot believe it, you told me, my dear

But she turned and slowly walked away, and I could hear her say
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

'Cause she don't love me no more
She don't need me no more
Oh, I'm all by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby, baby bye-bye)
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)

I might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
'Cause she don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
'Cause she don't need me no more
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)
She don't need me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)
All by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)

// Seek And You Shall Find //

Oh I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me, true love is hard to find

So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find
That's what they would say

The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find

Sometimes I get so lonely
It seems useless to groan
But then I remember
Somewhere true love has waited there
But I'll keep on holding on
Keep on keeping on
But I know that I keep trying
I can lose
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh

There is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
You know that I'm gonna keep holding on
Cause I now if I keep trying
I can't lose, cause there's no denying
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Ohhh
Seek and you shall find
If it's love that you're looking for
Seek and you shall find
It must be right around the corner
Seek
