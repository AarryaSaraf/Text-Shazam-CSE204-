// Brother, Brother //

Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been layin back a long time
But I love you like no other
Oh, brother of mine
I've been watching everything you do
And I've been wishing only good for you
All you've got to do is just want it to
And it's gonna - it's gonna come to you
Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been hangin' on a long time
But I love you like no other

Oh, brother of mine
You have always been so good to me
And though you didn't always talk to me
There wasn't much my lovin' eyes could not see
and I don't believe you need all your misery
Oh, brother, brother, brother
I know you've been hangin' on a long time
You know I love you like no other
Oh, brother, brother, brother
Talkin' about you, brother

// Put A Little Love In Your Heart //

Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart

// Work To Do //

I'm taking care of business, baby can't you see
I gotta make it for you, and I gotta make it for me
Sometimes it may seem girl I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time
But I got so many things to do

Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got a job yeah I got work to do,
Said I got work to do 

Oh I'm out here trying to make it, baby can't you see
It takes a lot of money to make, it let's talk truthfully
So keep your love light burning
And a little food hot in my plate
You might as well get used to me coming home a little late, oh 

Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got a job, yeah I got work to do
I got work to do, everybody's got work to do 

I'm taking care of business baby can't you see
I gotta make it for you,  I gotta make it for me
Don't wanna make you feel I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time, oh
But I got so many things to do

// Pop That Thang //

Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Ting a ling a ling
I hook it on up
Get on down
Now do your stuff
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Runnin' after that hen
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Sister Rosaline
Ting a ling a ling
Look at that child
Popping that thang
Hitch up to my wagon
And get ready to roll
But don't get on board
If you can't carry the load
If balloon goes down
I fill it up with wind
If the record stops
Start it over again
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Ting a ling a ling
Hook it on up
Get on down
And do your own stuff
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Running after that hen
Come on and pop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Come on and pop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Come on and pop it

// Lay Away //

Gonna put your lovin' in the lay away
Coming back to get it on another day, Hey
Don't have to worry 'bout it gettin' away Hey, Hey
Well, your love is safe in the lay away

Hey, Hey Layaway

Since the day I saw you and
My heart keeps beating for you
And I ain't gonna let you get away

You ain't gonna get away

Gonna put it in the lay away... 

I'm just gonna put it in the lay away - in the lay away
Coming back to get it on another day  
Coming back to get it on a rainy day  
I've got to put your love in the lay away

// It's Too Late //

Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time. 
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin' 
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin' 

And it's too late, baby now, it's too late, 
Though we really did try to make it 
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,

And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no 

It used to be so easy, livin' here with you 
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do 
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool 

And it's too late, baby now, it's too late, 
Though we really did try to make it. 
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide, 
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no  

There'll be good times again for me and you, 
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too? 
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you 

And it's too late, baby now, it's too late, 
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it) 
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide, 
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no 

It's too late baby, it's too late now darling 
It's too late.
