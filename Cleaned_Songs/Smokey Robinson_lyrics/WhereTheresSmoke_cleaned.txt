// It's A Good Night //

It's a good night for staying at home
A good night for doing the town
A good night for living it up
And it's a good night for settling down

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

It's a good night for parties and fun
A good night to get some exposure
A good night be with someone
Snuggled up in a little enclosure

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

I woke up this morning
And I look so forward to
This evening coming
So that I could be with you
Tonight has been given
To do what we want to do
Morning, be my friend
And take your time dawning in

It's a good night, don't leave it too fast
Don't let it end too soon
A good night, please let it last
At least 'til tomorrow or noon, ooh...

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right, ooh...
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

Oh, it's a good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me, baby, well
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

Ooh, it's a good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night, baby
So right for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right, ooh...
Don't say goodnight, ooh, baby
That wouldn't be right

Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh

Don't say goodnight
Ooh, baby
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, no, baby
Don't say goodnight, ooh...
That wouldn't be right
Ooh, baby
That wouldn't be right
Ooh, don't say goodnight...

// I Love The Nearness Of You //

Ooh, baby...

Are we lovers forever
Or just borrowing days
I know when we're together
Feels like something that should last always
Temporary temptation
Or a permanent joy
Should I make preparation
To be cast aside like broken toy

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Ooh, baby
I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Ooh, baby

From the middle of nowhere
Through the outskirts of bliss
To the inroads of heaven
When my lips feel your kiss
Just how far have I traveled
Where have you taken me
Will love's riddle unravel
Or forever be a mystery

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, I love the nearness of you, baby, yeah

Ooh, if we ever got parted
I'd be lost, that's a fact
How we ever got started
Well, as I look back to be exact

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you

I don't know too much about it
But I know I can't do without it
I know is that I love, I love the nearness of you, yeah
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you, baby, oh...

I love the nearness of you, baby, yeah
Ooh, I love the nearness of you, ooh...
I don't know too much about it
But I know I can't do without it
I know, I know I love the nearness of you, baby...

// Hurt's On You //

Well, ooh, baby
(Hurt's on you)
Oh, say it again
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Ooh, baby

Love is full of surprises
For most we don't prepare
It makes a fool of the wisest
And sometimes seems so unfair
How could you lead me on, ooh, baby
Knowing I love so strong
Didn't you notice the pain
That day we stood in the rain and I cried
But you said, "what can I do"

Hurt's on you
I can't help it we're through
Love's put the hurts on you
I don't know what to do
Love's put the hurts on you
Hurt's on you, baby
Yeah

Time brings on many changes
What's up one day is down the next
Cards switch hands, the table rearranges
And now it seems that you're perplexed
I could have told you that
One day, one day you would be back
Now you're feeling the pain
Of the blade that cuts both ways

Hurt's on you
Now you're feeling it too
Love's put the hurts on you
I don't know what you should do
Love's put the hurts on you
Yeah, hurt's on you, baby

(Hurt's on you)
Hurt's on you, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you
(Love's put the hurts on you)
I don't know what you should do
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, 'cause love has hurt me too, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, hurt for you, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
It's your turn to be blue
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, love has hurt me too, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you, baby...

// Ever Had A Dream //

Ever had a dream to come true
Well, I have and it still feels like
I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Ever wished for love on a star above, ooh...
And it came right up to you and said, "now how do you do"

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, hey
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, hey
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel
Right on, baby

Ever been involved to a certain extent
Surprise, because when you jumped into the situation
You had another intent, altogether
Ever been in real deep over your head
And found out that the one you thought was hit and run
Would be forever instead
Right on, baby, yeah

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, yeah
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, yeah
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel, feel, feel
Right on, baby, yeah

Ooh, baby, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh...
Right on, baby, yeah

Well, there's nothing like something to come true, yeah
Something you admire, baby, and it belongs to you
Well, there's nothing like something that's for real, yeah
Something you can hold in your arms
Something that you can feel, feel, feel
And there's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Like something to come true
And for me, baby, that's you

// Get Ready //

I'm gonna stay, baby
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Get ready, here I come
Get ready, here I come

I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real
I say that you do, you're outta sight

So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready, baby
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
I'm gonna stay
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Yes, I am
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If all my friends should want you too
I understand it, be alright
But I hope I get to you before they do
The way I planned it, be outta sight

Oh, tiddley-dee, tiddley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready, baby
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, get ready 'cause here I come

(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Baby, I'm gonna stay
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
Yeah, baby, once I get there, yeah
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

I'll be going nowhere
I'm gonna stay
I wanna stay, baby

Stay, baby
Stay, baby
I'm gonna stay, baby
Feel that rhythm
(Get ready)

Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, oh...
Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Get ready, here I come
Get ready, here I come

Stay with you, baby, yeah
I got to stay with you, baby

Well, well, well, well, well, well

I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do, you're alright
Yeah, baby, you're alright, alright, alright...

// Cruisin' //

Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one-night stand, baby, yeah
So, let the music take your mind
Ooh, just release and you will find

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

So good to cruise with you, baby

Let's flow, let's glide
Ooh, let's open up, and go inside
And if you want, it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you, baby, oh...
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way

The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
