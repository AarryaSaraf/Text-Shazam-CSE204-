// Old Fashioned Love //

(Old fashioned love, old fashioned love)

Strollin' down the lane at midnight
Old fashioned love, yeah
Steal a little kiss in the moonlight
Old fashioned love, yeah
You're the love of my life
The girl of my dreams
I can count on you, you can count on me

We got an old
Old fashioned love, oh, baby
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love, baby

Gotta be true to each other
In an old fashioned love
Like ours, baby
Never hurt one another, no
In an old fashioned love, ow!
Just like in the movies
But we're not pretending
Always and forever
Our love's one happy ending
(Our love is never-ending)

We got an old
Old fashioned love
You and me, baby, yeah
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love
Ooh, baby, yeah

Old fashioned love

You're the love of my life
The girl of my dreams
I can count on you, you can count on me

We got an old
Old fashioned love, yes, baby
It's so hard to find
This one of a kind
Old fashioned love, yeah

That's the kind of love
When a woman loves a man and a man loves a woman
Time keeps passin' and love keeps comin'
All the time, all the time
Strollin' down the lane at midnight
Steal a little kiss in the moonlight

Old, old fashioned love
You and me, baby
Old, old fashioned love, yeah
Gotta be true to each other...

// Are You Still Here //

Are you still here
Are you still haunting me
Are you still wanting me to want you
Although you have gone

Are you still here
I don't know what to do for this
I thought I traded you for Mr. Blues
But you keep hangin' on

I thought you had gone for good
I thought I could make it
Even though I thought I could
I can't take it

You're like a chain, my love
And I can't seem to break it
You're like a chain, my love
And I can't seem to break it

Yes, you're still here
How can you be here when you're there
I feel your presence everywhere
Although you have gone
You keep hangin' on
Although you have gone

// The Only Game In Town //

Yeah...

Lady Luck doesn't smile on everyone
You can bet your heart, she'll break it just for fun
Whenever the wheel spins, somebody's gotta lose, yeah
And I might be losin', but I can't walk away
Love's a gamble, but we all gotta play

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

I can take my pick, but I always seem to choose
From the deck of hearts, marked for me to lose
Those are the chances we all gotta take, take
You can count up the heartbreaks, but you can't cash in
Just keep believin', soon you're gonna win

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

There's no use cryin' about it, yeah
So, baby, what would life be without it

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

Yeah

Yeah, there's no use cryin' about it
Oh, but, baby, what would life be without it
Without it

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around, oh...
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town, yeah
Love is the only game around, oh...
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love's the only game

It's the only
Yeah, it's the only
Oh... well
Love is the only game

It's the only game in town
Talkin' 'bout love, yeah
Love is the only game around
It's the only game in town
Love is the only game...

// International Baby //

Fraulein, lips like cherry wine
Kissed me and then we were in Berlin
Senorita, no love could be sweeter
Lovin' that lets me go to Spain and Mexico

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in this world
You're my girl

Polynesian flower, you're the lady of the hour
No one makes Honolulu like I know you do
Little lotus blossom, no sense playin' possum
Together, you know we go lovin' in Tokyo

To me you're every woman in this world
You're my girl

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no

Soft and sweet
Yeah

Sweet bird with every tender word
You're takin' me on down to London town
Sister, sister, sister
I'm the envy of every mister
Rhode Island to San Diego
They envy me 'cause they know

You're my international baby
I don't mean maybe, no
To me you're every woman in my world
You're my girl

// Merry-Go-Ride //

If you could only let me in
I know that love, it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you

Yes, and take you on a merry-go-ride of love, oh...
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Come on, give in, baby, come with me
Your troubled mind and hang-ups, I'll set them free
Come into me, 'cause I'm into you
Unleash your massive passion, let love come through

Yes, and take you on a merry-go-ride of love, oh...
A spinning, turning, floating on air kind of love

Don't you want to ride

// I'll Try Something New //

I will build you a castle with a tower so high
It reaches the moon
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly
And compose you a tune
Give you lovin' warm as mama's oven
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new, yeah

I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will walk with your hand in my hand
You'll be queen of the stars
And everyday we can play on the Milky Way
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea
To wear in your hair
I'll do anything and everything to keep you happy
Girl, to show you that I care
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellows
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I'll take the stars and count them and move a mountain
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new
Got a try something new

If at first I don't succeed
Try again, that's what I'll do
Always trying something else
Always trying something that's new
Got to try something new
Got to try something new

// Destiny //

A gypsy once told me
That I was on a path of destiny
My gypsy, she told me
That I would catch a star meant for me
Baby, I've been around
I've been kissed a time or two
But my fate of love
Is destiny I never knew

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

A glow will find me
And I will love a child born for me
My violin will play
And the child will bring me love and harmony
Oh, baby, we'll spin around
We'll ride a carousel for two
We will pledge our love
My destiny is loving you, ooh...

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

Oh, baby, we'll spin around
We'll ride a carousel for two
We will pledge our love
My destiny is loving you, ooh...

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, you're my love
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

I caught a star, I caught a star
Out there meant for me
You're my star, yes, you are
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny, ooh...

You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny

I caught a star, I caught a star
A star that's meant for me, ooh...
You're my star, yes, you are
You're my destiny
My destiny, my destiny
You're my destiny...
