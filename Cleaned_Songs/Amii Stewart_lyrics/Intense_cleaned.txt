Album: Intense

// Friends //

Come on my friend and leave your caution to the wind
I know we used to keep that feeling out of sight
It's getting stronger, I feel it burning in my mind
Slowly teasing me it's growing deep inside

Come on and lay your tender lips down on my skin
Show me how sweet and easy it can be
And let us stick together and make it happen

I won't think it over again
Take you to the top
Tell me every hidden thought
Come on let me love you again
Do the best I can
Make me tremble with your breath

Come on my friend and leave your caution way behind
I wanna love your body till the morning light
Ooh, watch me my friend
I feel you reachin' in my mind
Though I know we'll be in love just for one night

I keep on trying to change my point of view again
But everything it seems to be the same
I want you where you are now
Don't wanna lose you

I won't think it over again
Take you to the top
Tell me every hidden thought
Come on let me love you again
Do the best I can
Make me tremble with your breath

Lay your tender lips down on my skin
Show me how sweet and easy it can be
And let us stick together and make it happen

Ooh, take me to the...
Take me to the top
You know I love you baby now and forever
Ooh, yeah

// Weak //

There's a part of me that just wants to do everything you say
There's an other part that just wants to turn around and slap your face
'Cause everytime I think you understand the way that it should be
You end up hurting me

I don't wanna fight I don't wanna lose everything we had
But you that know sometimes the good side loses to the bad
And everytime I walk away we end up shouting in the street
It may be bittersweet

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause I every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
And then I hear you speak
I get weak

Feels like time is standing still right here when you're touching me
And it feels like there's no place that I would rather be
But if it doesn't feel the same to you, then I'm not getting through
I've got to know the truth

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
And then I hear you speak

I get weak
You know that I get weak
Really I get weak

I'm not waiting anymore this is how I feel
I'm tired of excuses I've got to know it's real

'Cause I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
'Cause every time I walk away the devil takes over in me
Yeah
I get weak and then you win me over
I get weak coming back for more
Weak, think I will be stronger then before
And then I hear you speak
I get weak

// Make It Real //

Where we walk, down the road, everyday
With a plastic smile and we wave like we're in a parade

Ooh, and then we pass one another
And nothing but a "how do you do"
Ooh, but it makes me smile
And we'd stop for awhile
And just give me the truth now

We can make it real
Open your heart
Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real now
We can make it

Let your mind, take a walk, in the rain
Let you head roll back, touch the joy, remember the pain

Cause we can talk about the weather
We can weather it together my friend
And the sun will shine on your heart and mine
We will feel it again and again and again

We can make it real
Open your heart
Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You'll feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real, yes we can
No, we can make it real

This life that we're liven
It's all that we're given
It's all little precious time
But now it's the moment
Let your emotions breathe in the open sky
And fly...

We can make it real...

Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You'll feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real
...
