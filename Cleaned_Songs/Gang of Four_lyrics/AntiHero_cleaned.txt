Album: AntiHero

// Forever Starts Now //

They live in this time and this place
He holds her close as he laughs in her face
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
When the rubber hits the road
What could go wrong?
Nothing's wrong

What they gonna get at the end?
He gets down on one knee to make amends
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
That's when for him it's gone wrong
It's gone wrong

Her compliance will pay big dividends
So he gets down on one knee to make amends
He wants to be a hero, a hero!

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
She won't sing along with his song
With his song

// Day Turns To Night //

Nothing is ever
Meant to last forever
It's a clich√© 'cause it's true
I don't feel no regrets
Just so I can remember
Is it too late to say thank you

You caught me just in time
Before it got too late
Now nothing'll be the same
You've forever changed my fate

First I was nobody
Till you gave me the key
Opened the door for me
Then I was somebody

I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
'Cause I'll never forget all the years
That you brought me along for the ride
Took the world on side by side

So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night

I'm a little bit older
A little bit wiser
'Cause you taught me how to do it right
Only now that it's done
And the war, it is won
I can see that it was worth the fight

You gave me everything
Didn't want anything in return
With every step you'd take
Every move you'd make, I learnt

First I was nobody
Till you gave me the key
Opened the door for me
Then I was somebody

I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
'Cause I'll never forget all the years
That you brought me along for the ride
Took the world on side by side

So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night

So long, goodbye
So long, goodbye
