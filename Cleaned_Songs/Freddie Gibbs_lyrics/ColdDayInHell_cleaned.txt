Album: ColdDayInHell

// Barely M.A.D.E. It //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
So I just twist up a sweet
Brain tissue stay gettin burned
As I cruise up 94, did a robbery night before
He thought I was there to purchase 10, but I robbed him for 90 more
Now I'm 100 solid, bout to set up shop in Wisconsin
Grabbed my phone and chirped my plug in Milwaukee, he just responded
Homie told me sex, money and drugs, they rule the earth
So get your own, you know them thangs good as gone when they touch the turf
Destined to pay for my dirt, the resist of temptation was hard
So be a thug from your birth til you face to face with your God
And when I'm faced with that moment, I check out chiefin on straight kill
Baptized in a lake of fire, so this how hell feel

And I ain't never snitched or took the stand, bitch I'm a gangsta

Made nigga, bitch I'm a make it at all costs
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
Heard his family wept, with my weaponery blew the wall off
Know some Belizian boys that'll bury you with your balls off
Castrated
Niggas in yo click cut yo throat just cause you candy painted
Made a little change and they forgot that you barely made it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket of crabs
I couldn't put food in my budget, I was bustin my ass
To make a choice to either eat or have money for gas
Enough to make you break morals for the love of this cash
The devil work and he stay immersed in my idle time
When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cause I'm on my dick

I'm a made nigga, bitch I'm a make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Heard he utter words of my murder, but it was all talk
The killers I know don't get caught, but I bet they all walk
I'm a made nigga, bitch I'm a make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
This thuggin gon' be the death of me, lord we all lost

[B.J. The Chicago Kid:]
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me what would you do?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?

// Rob Me A Nigga //

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Cause the bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
Right now I just might rob me a nigga

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
The liquor got me lurking and looking for a lame nigga
To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'm a hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I'm a show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'm a be up in his crib waiting
"Bitch where the cash? I can taste it"
Put em on their face: what you know about kidnapping
And holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?
When your stomach empty it's easy to understand it
Got me out here taking them penitentiary chances
"Born in this world of tears, will die laughing"
Put that on the headpiece right above my casket
Still in the game, my batteries still lastin
Bout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
Right now I just might rob me a nigga

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
As I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm
Seen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm
Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, I'm a put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigger, "Where da sack at? "
Get hit, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
I'm a shoot you point blank, I'm just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that's the street code
I'm leave you there, do you, that's how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that's a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies scrap, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come
Forty eight hours, nigga round my way
Everyday nigga lookin like a sitcom
In this game of lose or draw nigga
You can be the one that get robbed
Or be the one to rob a nigga
But we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep
We gon wait it out and kill a nigga

// 187 Proof //

[Verse 1:]
I grew up wishing my life would be like the Cosby's
I go that extra mile to escape this ghetto monotony
See how this vicious cycle could fuck with you psychologically
You better cooperate with the state or become they property
Bitch my name be breaking bail from the street to the jailhouse
And it ain't no transaction unless I came with my scale out
Roll in yo college, I just might fuck up and fail out
Fucking bitch after bitch, stacking my chips, all I care bout
Fuck with GBA, bitch I need a CPA, come and count it up
Thousand thugs tryna catch him crowded around the bus
We start to throw down, if you down to fuck, then you down with us
I know hoes that'll smoke a stick, sloppy drunk, and get powdered up
This Corporate Thug World, they like you but they love the realest
Straight Gary gangsta shit, didn't come up off no fucking gimmicks, bitch
2Pac ain't back cause he got set up and shot in the chest
Biggie ain't either, so won't y'all gon let them niggas rest?

[Hook:]
I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I'm hard to kill like Steven Seagal with yo fucking troops
Yo choppas ain't chopping shit if yo niggas ain't down to shoot
And I'm ready to R.I.P. any nigga that y'all recruit
Cause I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
It's Gibbs, bitch

[Verse 2:]
A walking 187, 187 crazy
Sick like Moammar Gadhafi, straight 187 babies
I reach for that reefer stench and my shit knocking Brotha Lynch
So lock me in correctional, but you can't fix me or fucking see me
You know who you fucking with? A nigga who got shit to lose
I got niggas that rob you and rape yo bitch if they in the mood
Check my record, I been a fool, semi autos all in my locker
Flow stupid like I rode the bus to school with Waka Flocka
187 ways to die, bitch, this the end
6 niggas put 600 holes in yo 600 Benz
Bitch, I'm murder proof, I'm a live forever
Duncan block, Virginia street, bitch, we the clique together
Ask Pill who the real, bet he mention (Gibbs)
Killing niggas in the 4th Ward, shout out to my nigga Slick
Shout out to my nigga Hit, West side murder cat
Some of my niggas flow, but most of them beat that murder rep

[Hook:]
Cause I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
Cause I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
It's Gibbs, bitch

// Anything To Survive //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I was gone before he hit the ground
Saw his body shiver and get spinned around
He might be out for the count, them hollow tips pinned him down
Now I ain't slept in two weeks, I'm up like I'm tweaking
Serving geekers, man it's hard to get paper up when you beefing
Niggas know my face
Niggas know my name, where I stay at
Is they gonna bitch up or is they gonna be patient and get they payback?
Fuck a sitting duck, we just gonna clip up and go where they stay at
Add the pressure til them hoes get the message, I'm gon' relay that
I got five thousand, a couple ounces and plenty burners, bruh
TV and a microwave for my dro, fuck the furniture
And my homie sister a geeker, should I be serving her?
It's like we feed each other's addictions
I'm out here earning a living off of killing my own
Flipping, pitching them stones
Niggas gonna listen cause I'm living this shit in my songs
If I should die before I wake
Just know some busters ran up in my spot and shot me in my face
Cause I'm a motherfucking gangster

[Hook: Adrian]
And I move through the day, carry on through the night
What I do to get paid? Anything to get by
And I move through the day, carry on through the night
What I do to get paid? Anything to survive

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Young, black, violent, Islamic, that's how they painted me
Forgot seasoned and polished, plenty knowledge from scholars
Globe trotter, I be in the ZaZa in Dallas
Doing my daily routine with a queen from Hollis
Know that I came from the bottom here, for the challenge
Not trying to cause mileage, try to maintain the balance
But it's kinda hard when
Niggas that swore to be made men just can't maintain they silence
Central minds under storm, make it rain violent
Sodom and Gomorrah style, hurricane island
Hit em with the 4-5, if it get homicide, matter fact suicide
Wonder if his crew will ride?
Who am I?
It's the one and only bitter Wyatt Earp, acquire work, I do oblige
Get the work to you asap, through the dodge
These other niggas telling fairytales, but we them guys
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sly Polaroid]
High rollers send the yola down to Minnesota
Money is the motive, niggas know I go scrotum
Getting cabbage is a habit
If we establish any suckas ain't cut from my fabric
You can clearly see I'm messing with another stylist
We the best and we ain't never met DJ Khaled
Certified head bussa, so above your average
They comin from Texas, I'm balling like a Dallas Maverick
If you ever middleman me cause I'm shopping through ya
Money on your head is how I send ya profits to ya
If ya snitching, then I gotta send them choppas to ya
Fuck a witness, hit the shooters on the prosecutor
I'm talking digits, seven large on my debit card
Never been a thief, pussies fuck with credit fraud
My heart's colder than a popsicle
Give you more shots than a hospital
Cause I'm a motherfucking gangsta

[Hook]

// Twos And Fews //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I do it for the
Thug niggas and bitches off in my neighborhood
Bout to hit that pop with that product, make sure ya paper good
Statistics ain't in my favor, but I'm a make it through it
Don't work no job, man a nigga can't even get insurance
How you supposed to take ya babies on a doctor visit?
These conditions validate my excuse for this type of living
Gotta watch these cops cause I'm pushing poison like Michael Bivins
Running in your spot where you have them chickens is my religion
The Stick Up Man, so cut me in or cut it out, bitch
Quick to walk my dog up to your doorstep if you doubt this
Bury me with Swishers and at least an ounce to bounce with
Corporate Thuggin Mafia, you bout that life, or you ain't bout shit
Picture me rolling that brand new Ferrari California
And the sex was great, fuck a second date, it was nice to know ya
A bougie bitch that can't take the smoke, she ain't like the odor
Fresh off the dopehouse with geekers tweaking off my aroma
Fuck your artists, pistol charges, man I got like two of those
Better know when it come to them choppers, got quite a few of those
Nigga

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
A few of those get me right for the nighttime
Getting gone til I see the sunlight shine
Yo pick to stay with a pack of bitches, that's super cold
That OG kush and them platinum cookies, I'm stupid blowed
So whatcha need out the trunk, cause I got like two of those
And when it comes to them choppers, got quite a few of those
Nigga

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I'm fresh off my flight, nigga, New York City
Had the tool in the club like I'm Shyne and Diddy
Said this shit can get ugly like Craig Mack
And my niggas in ya crib asking where that bread at?
Club, that means a few bottles, a few shots mayne
Live and die in LV, 2pac mayne
Thought they had me boxed in, boxed in the corner
I guess they didn't know my momma had me on the corner?
All I know is crack rock, crack spots, nigga, crack pots
They say hit the dealership and buy the whole lot
See I'm irresponsible, I lost the whole top
And this shit I'm smoking on, it cost a whole lot
Give my niggas 20 grand, shoot up your whole block
Catch ya slipping on the porch, knock off ya whole top
It's the world motherfucker, next the universe
Counting paper hurt my hand, I need a fuckin nurse
It's Young Jizzle motherfucker, I get it how I live
You pussy niggas getting love, there go Gangsta Gibbs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Gangsta Gibbs ho
Two bitches cooking in the crib ho
A quarter kilo and some Kool Aid in the fridge ho
Thuggish ruggish black motherfucker in a black lac
Black talon knock the letters off a snapback
He pushing packages, I think he in the rat pack
We got the villa in Anguila, blowing anthrax
Mob shit, there really ain't no speaking about this thing of ours
Born and raised up in the G, a nigga beat the odds
You see me floating to the crib with a fleet of broads
Might wanna fuck in my garage when they see them cars
These niggas drop that goofy shit and yeah I'm sure it sold
There's real niggas rapping, there's only a few of those, nigga

// Let Ya Nuts Hang //

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Now nigga, you don't wanna see me when my sack low
I keep them killers at your front and at yo back door
Layed on a stretcher when it's pressure, man we bust thangs
Cause in the streets I claim, you gotta let ya nuts hang

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Caught in the cycle, black American psychopathic
And I can't do right, nigga, doing wrong is my rite of passage
Straight in the street life, I'm trying to interact with the 'matics
One hundred baggies all wrapped in plastic, I'm living savage
It's hot in these damn streets, shot this nigga last week
Police on my last nerve, I'm a gon' make this last serve
And hit 65 South and get blowed than a bitch
You see me back in the g, then that means I'm back on my dick
Back on that bullshit, full clip, don't play with a full deck
Hope my pack ain't caught up, it ain't made it to my hood yet
Did some niggas dirty, and I can't wait for the day they burn me
Cause I showed them hoes no mercy, Lord forgive me, I was thirsty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scrilla]
You don't wanna see me with that sack low
My name ain't Jody, but I'm coming through your back door
In all black, no mask, with a.45
And if this pussy buck a lick, then it's homicide
I'm from Zone 4 Atlanta, where these killers ride
Snatch a nigga out the car and take a nigga pride
And if we beefing in these streets, ain't nowhere you can hide
We kill a nigga, dump his body on 285
I'm getting tired of all these fuck niggas running around
Talking all that tough shit
Like you've been there and you've sold that
But in real life you don't run shit
My homie called me with a big lick
10, 000 bills, about 10 bricks
I'm walking in with that big stick
Gonna lay it down with that dope dick

[Hook]

// Let 'em Burn //

Burn muthafucka burn!
I'm made, the shit you muthafuckas can't fade

Jumped up off the porch and threw my nuts down in these streets, dog
Can't lean on my daddy, told my family I'm gon' feed y'all
Bitch niggas can't stand me cause I won't live on my knees, dog
Swear they gonna get at me, I'm in your hood
Bitch, I don't see y'all
Gangsta Gibbs from gangsta island, nothing but money piling
To the ceiling is all I'm feeling and all I think about
It's crazy how these controlled substances got us busting shit
I can't control my life, it's in sole control of the government
Across the nation it's plenty niggas in litigation
Sneetches cut your throat to cut time and soften their situations
Serving hard or soft you know me I'm dead with them demonstrations
Haters can't contest us, K-Y-S I can feel your frustrations
Yes some niggas tried to murk me
Guess those bullets wasn't meant for me
I'm a catch they ass and burn 'em, you suckas get no sympathy
A menace to my city, I forever live in infamy
And I know your so-called history's a mystery

[Hook:]
I show niggas no pity
Run in my fuckin city
Don't like it, come and get me
Father please forgive me
I'm a gangster, I'm a hustler
Couldn't play me for no sucker
I'll blow the roof up off this muthafucka

Let it burn
Burn, muthafucka, burn

We don't need no water
These niggas don't want no drama
I'm a terrorize these streets
Till these fools come get my like Osama
I ain't ducking or hiding
When I'm out here smoking and riding
Heard there's a hit on the babyface, bitch it ain't hard to find him
Must I remind him? Gangster shit ain't for play
You write this shit on the paper
But I live that shit every day
I seen the biz killed my dude in front of his family like some ho
Every time I hit the stage it's four police at all my shows
Mother had him, mother love him
Courts and judges, motherfuck 'em
Thousand grammin' went straight slammin'
In for life, it's corporate thuggin
Wear the mask, up in all black, you bitches rather be proactive
Talked to Charlie Mack he said I got the city on my back
They call me Bobby Suds since these niggas can't fade me
He got indicted by a snitching bitch named Stacey
I know these rapper niggas that got my brother's skrilla thirty five
Said Fred you hot, so these thug niggas gon' try to be by your side

[Hook]

// B.A.N.ned //

[Verse 1:]
Fuck you bitch ass nigga
I won't kiss ass with ya
Didn't like you from the jump
You jump on dick ass nigga
Bet yo RN be yo best friend when this here fin blast hit ya
Got a thick money grip and a thick booty bitch
I'm a twist a thick ass Swisher
And just get comatose
On that California dope
One night wasn't enough so yo bitch came back for another dose
Onions in my overcoat
Slamming and it's evident
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President
The motherfucking President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
Monica me down like I'm the motherfucking President
The President, President, bitch I'm out for presidents
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President

[Verse 2:]
You bitch ass nigga
I won't kiss ass with ya
Hope you mob with your squad, I done robbed some rich ass niggas
These niggas fake and it's stunting
Resume ain't 100
Bitch we made in that mid
Str8 Slammin Click, niggas run it
We booked this ho for a show, gave him the cash in advance
He saw GI 100 deep, was scared to hop out his van
Said Gangsta Gibbs, we cool with you, but yo, what's up with your fam?
Once this ho nigga hit the stage, I bet he pissed in his pants
We leave you comatose, pull that bulldog.44
Straight to his mouth, nigga said what he about
But deep down he really don't want it doe
Cause bitch I set the precedent, murk you with no evidence
GI to the Chi, bitch I'm the motherfucking President
I said the motherfucking President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
Monica me down like I'm the motherfucking President
The President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President

Fuck a bitch ass nigga
Just a bitch ass nigga
Bitch
You bitch ass nigga

Bitch

[Verse 3:]
And you can ban me from your motherfucking station, you can't ban me from the streets
Bitch I'm a gangsta, that's on nation
Them ho niggas on your label ain't part of the conversation and it's evident
Treat me like the President
The motherfucking President, President
Bitch I'm like the President
Monica me down like I'm the motherfucking President
The President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President

// My Homeboy's Girlfriend //

[Intro:]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches

[Verse 1:]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches
What I embody is so ungodly, God is my witness
Emotions froze, I'm so cold on every bitch on my team
A rolling stone, I move on like it's a daily routine
I used to have this bitch that had me twisted
Used to get drunk at the club and call me for random visits
She stumbled into my door and I smashed her in the kitchen
Yes she get rough when we sexing, flexing in all positions
Whispered and I often listened, she got a nigga at home
Not quite at home, he took a pitch and since '06 he been gone
She say she grown, she pay her bills and raise her kid on her own
Plus he touch down in a few days, I should just leave her alone
But it's that devil on my shoulder, telling me to come over
3am I hit the gas in my Chevy, blowin on doja
Got me stuck and I can't understand
Why I can't notice, I'm so bogus cause I know her man
I guess I'm dead wrong
Fa sho

[Hook:]
Money and bitches make the world spin
Fucking with you can make my world end
How I get caught up in this whirlwind?
Dead wrong, fucking my homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
But it's your homeboy's girlfriend
Fuckin my homeboy's girlfriend
Lovin my homeboy's girlfriend

[Verse 2:]
I wish I had the nuts to tell you this
While you was locked away in jail I was out here nailing your bitch
I even helped out with the house note, the car payments and shit
I never thought about our friendship, I just thought with my dick
And I was dead wrong, on bogus shit from the start
Cause of this lust in my mind, I carried this guilt in my heart
I be so weak to let a piece of pussy peel us apart
If you found out about this shit, might twist your feelings in knots
Speaking of feelings, I caught em
Big bag of dreams and I bought em
Visions of me and her stuck on an island hideaway balling
Sometimes I don't return her calls and pray one day she be off it
But yo it seems like since he came home, she been calling more often
Damn... guess she addicted to the way I treat her
Because she right back at my doorstep everytime that he beat her
Fussing and crying saying baby I need you, why you ignore me?
Testing me, stressing me, how dare she question my loyalty?
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Money and bitches
Niggas die for money and bitches
Trying to stay occupied, so I stay out there fucking bitches
But my affairs with this woman was extremely indecent
Truth is my homie got every right to come leave me leaking
Woke up with my phone on fire
Twenty, thirty missed calls
Called him back, he picked it up and I could tell he pissed off
He told me, bitch nigga, you see me, walk the other way
No room for explanation, just jump straight into pistol play
All them years we go back just got flushed down the toilet
Might lose my life behind this bitch, but man I just can't afford it
Whole situation could have been avoided
I wonder what went through his head when he picked up that loaded pistol and pointed
Like damn... if I can't have you in life, I guess I'll have you in death
Finished her off with 3 shots and turned the fifth on himself
Was it really love or did we both all fall for a sleazy broad?
Killed his girl and spared my fucking life, who had the deeper bond?
Damn

// So Amazin' (P.S.A. Part 2) //

[Hook: Sebastian Mego]
Sexual faces, screaming and shaking
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Had to beat it up, cause it was so amazing
Girl I know you can take it, I'm so impatient
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing
Had me coming back, cause it was so amazing

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I got a day off
So it's off to the hotel we creep
We ain't even gotta talk, baby take it all off
I'm a hit it 24 straight, no sleep
And have you blowing up my phone for the whole week
And dipping off on your dude on the low key
Hey man I got her on Patron doing things she don't even do at home
Could've sworn that was your freak
And I'm so deep
And she's so wet
She telling me that she don't wanna let it go yet
So I'm a slow my stroke down and leave her broke down
When I'm in town, girl I'm on deck
And don't be slipping with her phone, cause he gon' check
You gotta know that if I don't call, then I'm gon' text
I have you running up them walls when I get up in them draws
You know that I can do it all, baby no sweat
I know you sick of these lame-ass niggas so thirsty
Wanna rush and get up in it on the first day
You need a man that make you want it in the worst way
And beat it up like every day is your birthday
You want to bail, I can tell by the look in your face
Straight to the valet, she ain't looking to wait
And when you got something cooking, I've been looking to taste
I got a hot tub at my place and baby we can make

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Man I got a girl so impatient
At the hotel posted up waiting
And her boyfriend took her on a trip
She was blowing up my phone for the whole vacation
Lame niggas and the hoes stay hating
Steady tricking your dough, you can't make it
Girl, I know you want to ball for the cause
Blow it all at the mall on a pimp, straight lace him
Polo'd down to my socks and boxers
Had a couple rounds of straight shots of vodka
Add juice with that, she getting loose in fact
And when she blew that back, it's hard not to watch her
Got her running like a Cadillac, I ain't gonna stop her
Loaded up and keep me bustin off like a chopper
Straight thug shit, so let a thug hit
I bet you never ever put nothing above this
Cause these lame ass niggas so thirsty
I got swag so I slam on the first date
I'm coming through cause you want it in the worst way
I'm about to beat it up like it was your birthday
You want to bail, I can tell by the look in your face
It would be a crime not to hit it, how you looking today
Cause when you got something cooking, I've been looking to taste
I got a loud pack at my place and baby we can make

[Hook]

// Natural High (Even Higher Learning) //

[Verse 1:]
You like my
You like my
You like my
Morning, my light, my love, my heart, my soul
The only one I relate to
You've been looking for some one on one time
So let me pick you up and I'm a take you on a date boo
Everything I want and need
Am I in love? oh yes indeed
Only woman that I ever met in my life that had me tricking off all my extra cheese
Been in jail and I bled for you
You know the typical things that Fred'll do
And you remember back in the days
When I was 17, momma caught me laying in the bed with you
I'm a open up doors for you, diss all my hoes for you
You put me in my own world, make a niggas toe curl, like a real girl supposed to do
Plus I must admit I get sad when you away
I just can't live this life without you, I can't get through my day
One summer we had to break up cause you couldn't deal with the heat
Everybody in the hood wanna say that you a stone cold freak
They hit it last week, but I don't listen to a peep
Uh... this might sound like I'm simping
Y'all might just say I'm tripping
But you know a player gotta maintain
I don't flame Jane, I don't complete my mission
Your sense, your texture, your touch, I'm in lust
When I roll up with a couple blunts that roll with me, what's up?
One more puff, I wanna touch

[Hook:]
I wanna touch, wanna feel you
Can't ride without you by my side
I guess it's something when I'm near you
That keeps me on a natural high
I wanna touch, wanna feel you
Can't ride without you by my side
I guess it's something when I'm near you
That keeps me on a natural high

And I...
I love you mary, mary, baby
And I...
Don't go nowhere without my baby
And I...
I love you mary, mary, baby
And I...
Don't go nowhere without my baby
And I...

[Verse 2:]
Must say I do to you, so let's jump the broom
First time that we met, no sweat
Had to get you undressed up in my uncle's room
Sweet as two cherry pies
Red hair, green eyes
Gotta switch up flavors and colors, she accessorize
On the real, if you came as a meal, I would lick you fresh off the plate
Woke up this morning, brushed my teeth and kissed you fresh out the gate
Yeah I'm a fool for you, let them niggas hate
When I don't bring you 'round my homies say I'm handcuffing
Fuck em, they straight, they straight
They know you stay on deck
I make sure you stay fresh
Every time that I roll up, baby done shown up, wrapped in my favorite dress
That purple or that peach
Optimo, Swisher Sweets
Some fools can't move off that Mary
Freddie G never miss a beat
It might sound like I'm simping
Y'all might just say I'm tripping
But you know a player gotta maintain
I don't flame Jane, I don't complete my mission
Your smell, your texture, your touch, I'm in lust
When I roll up with a couple blunts that roll with me, what's up?
One more puff, I wanna touch

// Str8 Slammin' //

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Can you picture a nigga out here clocking cash and
Pulling stick ups, I guess I had to Glock and mask it
Nine zippers, let's bust that open, cut and bag it
Water whipper, I'm in the kitchen Str8 Slammin'
Thug niggas, and drug dealers, that's all I hang with
Puffing Swishers, and fucking hoes, we on the same shit
In the kitchen, gon' whip my weight up to a mansion
Eight figures, that's what I call Str8 Slammin

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
G.I. thuggin
Yes picture this Midwest nigga rollin
Hardrock hustling
Bitches stick to the dick cause you know a nigga holding
Living on some pimp shit
I'm a let y'all chase hoes, I'm a get chosen
Keep a bitch dick whipped
Got a whole lotta broads that'll bust that open
Fresh up off a straight dope stain
I know my clothes still smell like cocaine
The real niggas understand
I ain't trying to be the man
If you put it in my hands, it'll go mayne
I keep a whole thing or better pushed to the side
Got like 32 bells of bubba kush in the ride
If you wanna get high, all drugs I provide
Getting my thug on where I preside
Nigga been bust at, still I survive
Push packs and I live to tell it in my raps
Lost a couple homies, I can never get em back
Life got me stressed, so I'm twisting up a sack
I'm street certified, nigga - check my stats
Back up to the wall cause I'm coming up to bat
And these little niggas said they got racks on racks
So the stick up man had to put the tax on the tax
Got damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Fuck what I'm worth
Still out here on the grind
Trying to stack racks
Racks on racks, never caught slipping
Nigga get wrong, it's a toe tag
Fucks with the hood
Still eat good
Hanging with the killers with the black masks
They will kidnap your wife and kids
You niggas don't want that
Do what we gotta do to make it
Hope them jackers won't take it
If a nigga violate me I heard my young nigga's gon erase em
I don't fight over no bitches but I kill for bread
And I don't hang out with no niggas that sleep with Feds
Ride down on your block with that chopper, let that bitch go
If you try to open shop up, that shit closed
Money and the power
What we hustle for?
We already run ya house, ain't no kicking doors

[Hook]

// Menace II Society //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slamming
Freddie pull up in some '84 shit
Wrote this flow while smoking on dope, so call me the dopest
Crush these niggas feelings, then come right back in some mo shit
Different colors diamonds, I'm about to stunt on my old bitch
And slide out...
Black Macs and Cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take 'em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
Black Macs and Cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take 'em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
East Gary Indiana, bitch I'm puttin on
Get my weed out on the west cause that's my second home
Before you try to check a nigga, check out who you checkin on
Robbing on my resume, bitch I'm invading homes
Niggas call me Freddie Forgiato, I'm on low pros
Can't be sleepin on these streets, bitch it's no doze
Shouts out to the gang bangers, cain slingers flippin o's
Piru's, Hoover's, 8-tre's and 6-O's
Ride out
Plenty bitches got em undressin in my hideout
Bet she wishing I got her pregnant once I slide out
All my bitches is perfect 10s, nigga dime'd out
Keep it goin until her baby daddy find out
Keep a weapon, I'm never stressin
Shout out to G Malone, Jay Rock and 211
The peoples say my potna's is killers, menaces, dope dealers
Gangsta Gibbs, just a neighborhood thug nigga

[Hook:]
Ride out...
Black macs and cadillacs when we ride out
Man these bitches gon' stay attached when I slide out
We relax and take em back to my hideout
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
How about you and I
Hit the sky
Let's take a ride
Come on let's go
Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Gold D's and purple trees, let me fire up
Red Bull and Grey Goose til we wired up
She tell me she wanna see me, but I'm tired up
Shit I got a personal driver, put ya ride up
Yeah, a nigga shooting them dice, put ya five up
Say what we doin tonight, make ya mind up
Look I got this lil Cristal
To get you out of them drawers
I'm a keep it raw
After I do hit, I'm probably never'll call on some rap shit
Yeah I used to work at the mall on some black shit
Selling these hoes clothes, I'm a mack bitch
Can't you tell in my flows?
Gold rings on, Chanel Platinum all in her nose
That's my theme song
And you can't play the homies cause the team's strong
Girl we can't do nothin with them jeans on, on
So let them legs slide out

[Hook]

Big stacks, give me the racks when I ride out
You and I
Hit the sky
Let's take a ride
Come on let's go

// Neighborhood Hoez //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Sitting back, getting by dick sucked by the neighborhood ho
East side local 304, stay twisted off that reefer smoke
Stay twisted off them potent pills, might just taste the powder back
Candy nose, man I ran these hoes in a white Range Rove', 'bout to pound her back
No strings attached, bitch might be a ho but she my homie though
She got that friendly pussy, when I touch down she let my homies go
Preacher's daughter, choir every Sunday bitch you known to blow
When I was on the block broke back in '04, bitch act like she ain't know me though
But it's all to the good, baby I forgive ya, hoes caught up in the hype
See the chrome shine bright, and now they think I'm they type of nigga

This ain't a date and never hesitate, you can put your lips where you like but I like my swisha
"Fred you so cold on a ho," I know but I just sit back and get chose
All about my stacks fuck a rat bitch I'm gon' stay on ten toes
Got doctors, models, college freaks, and broads on strip poles
When I'm tipping in the G, gotta smoke one with my neighborhood ho

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Man, sometimes I like to kick it with them neighborhood hoes
Get drunk and puff a swisha with them neighborhood hoes
My bitch say I stay fucking with them neighborhood hoes
I swear, man it ain't nothing like them neighborhood hoes

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it
You riding around and you didn't
I am riding around with semis, life's a bitch so I pimp it
Bread long like Pippen, Gucci on, not Dickies
I will dick her down so quickly
I draw pistols with no pencils
You know what I'm here for, that's to get dough
Hotter than six niggas in a Pinto with the vents closed
Period, menstrual, sentimental bimbos
Telling me they love me but been with all my kinfolks
Want a slice like Kimbo, ice like igloo
I like a girl that like doing what her friend do
'Specially if it's me and I'm laying in the middle
And all my verses cold, my microphone should wear a trenchcoat
Trapping at the Citgo, yea the Citgo
Now I'm the shit, I remember when I was piss poor
Neighborhood hoes still hanging in the neighborhood
And I don't have to talk too much cause my paper do

[Hook x2]

// Heaven Can Wait //

[Verse 1:]
24 hours to live, what would you do?
Just get high, treat everyday like my birthday, smoke with the crew
Hit the hood cause you know bitches be thirsty for dudes with loot
I change the paint to money green on my cutlass, rumble the roof
Like it was reinvented, where the freaks is
What's a drop if ain't no bitches in it?
Ride with me today, I'm in a mood to go spend some spinach
On my niggas of course
Funny how we straight from section 8, now we chill in resorts
30, 40 deep on south beach, me and D-Edge
Brought some bitches with us, but fuck these Puerto Ricans instead
Do this for my people, hopefully I can leave them some bread
Before these punk polices or jealous streets leave me for dead
I live a wild life, some might say it's child-like
On my second childhood
Bubba kush, banana wood, sippin on some purple fluid
These drugs will kill me before I let you do it
187 Proof, I die today, I live through this music, Gibbs

[Hook: x2]
Before I check out, let me diamond my neck out
Blow a mil on my niggas, fuck bitches like I was fresh out
Fresh to death when I step out, every day approaching the gates
I live a helluva life, baby, heaven can wait

Heaven can wait

[Verse 2:]
Everyday I pray to be as strong as Huey Newton
Before you pull that trigger, take a closer look at who you shooting
Mirror image, nothing different, you just another slave
Tryin to succeed in these European's narcotics trade
Worked all week, 140 dollars was all I made
Fuck a job, I'd rather chop a rock and be chopping blades
Gotta watch these cops cause I came too far to die in a cage
Watch who you fuck, rather catch a bullet than die from aids
Before I check out, let me diamond my neck out
Crushing feelings on Broadway, I pulled that Monte SS out
Buy my mom a new spot and make sure that bitch super decked out
Swear I can't leave this Earth 'til I'm sure that you never stress out
Before I left out
I grab the zip and extra clips and hit the L on 21st and Virginia, and bless the fifth
Hit the lab so I can lay all the shit I didn't get to spit
Could die tonight, but what I write they forever gon' reminisce
It's Gangsta Gibbs

[Hook x2]

// My Dawgz //

[Hook:]
I do this shit for my niggas, my motherfucking dawgz
It's me and you against the world, nigga fuck em all
Whether we thugging in the streets or behind the wall
I do this shit for my niggas, my motherfucking dawgz
Yeah
For my niggas, my motherfucking dawgz
Yeah
For my niggas, I'm screaming fuck em all
Yeah
For my niggas, my motherfucking dawgz
Uh
For my niggas, I'm screaming fuck em all

[Verse 1:]
I'd ride for you
Damn near done died for you
When the po-po's searched the car, took the charge and I lied for you
That's on everything
A-one hundred solid, I never change
I'd trade my life for you nigga, I know you'd do the same
Whether we rob, steal, kill, just to get a meal
Thugging with me before this rap shit and the record deal
Surviving off the dollar menu from McDonalds
Promise we gon' live it up
That's if we live to see tomorrow
Never beg or borrow
My nigga take it til he make it
And ever since I was a kid, I fight for you like we related
You my motherfucking brother
Share my bitches, share my weed
If it's dough, how much you need?
If you sit down, I'll feed your seeds
Plenty time we disagree, but stuck it out like real niggas
We straight on the petty shit cause we see the bigger picture
I tell my homies that I love em while I'm still around em
I do this shit for them cause I couldn't do this shit without em

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Cause you's a down-ass bitch, and I ain't mad
I promise that for you and Matt, I might just give my last
So smart and beautiful, I'm so proud when I look at you
I call her my baby sister, but you my nigga too
Yeah, we used to fuss and fight
Cause we so much alike
Steady trying to prove you wrong, when all along I know you right
People say your brother do dirt, he can't keep his hands clean
But through it all, you ain't never shit on my rap dream
Love me when I'm balling, the same way when I'm falling
Miss my family while I'm working, I can't come around that often
Always make the time to call her
And let her know I'm gravy
Heard you bout to have a baby
Uncle Fred, that sounds so crazy
Maybe I've been tripping lately
Cause I ain't stop and holler'd
And make sure that you straight before I make another dollar
Sometimes my life be crazy in this race to get in richer
But I never put a thing before my family or my motherfuckin niggas

[Hook]
