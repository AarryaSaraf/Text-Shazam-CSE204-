Album: TexasSun

// Texas Sun //

You say you like the wind
Blowing through your hair
Come on, roll with me till the sun goes down
Texas sun

Say you wanna hit the highway
While the engine roars
Well come on, roll with me till the sun goes down
That Texas sun
Oh yeah

Texas sun

Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Come on, roll with me til the sun dips low
Texas sun

Texas sun, oh girl
The Texas sun

When I'm far from home
And them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me nice and you keep me warm
Wanna feel you on me
Can't wait to get back there again
Texas sun

Texas sun
Texas sun
Texas sun

You say you like the wind
Blowing through your hair
Well come on, roll with me til the sun goes down
Texas sun
Texas sun

Ooh, baby, you're so gorgeous
How about you and me take a lil trip
In the big body?

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Oh, girl

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Baby, oh I know

Take a ride with me baby
You by my side
How does it sound
You and I

// Midnight //

You stayed up in Poly
I lived in Crowley Town
Needed me to get you
From your mother's house
Baby, I'll be there just
Put on your lavender
Perfume and a nice dress
Girl, I hope you like this

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Sailing up the highway
You smoked with the windows down
Reflection in the rearview
Fading lights from town
I know you can't stay too late
I'll have you home in time
Let's find a place of silence
Beyond the county line

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Midnight black on the outside
Midnight black on the outside

I remember how it was back then
We were just young ones
And on that night you said you loved me softly
Left a haze on the window

I had to borrow my mamma's car that night
To come and scoop you
Just for some good fun
And we had a great time that night
I wonder where you are now

So if you hear this let me know
Oh
Maybe we can go again
Oh, yes

// C-Side //

She got them red heels on
Gold hangin' from her ears
Melanin lady
She got her jig on strong
It's so good to be here
With you

Somebody's gonna fall in love tonight
And I hope we make sweet love tonight

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

You shine in a sea of people
Oh, this moment's so regal
Melanin lady
Covered in all white lace
You're the baddest in the place
So good, shawty

Somebody's gonna fall in love tonight
Let's lose ourselves in this second line tonight

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

// Conversion //

Your love poured into my heart
Your love poured into my heart
Your love poured into my heart
Like the water that flows from the pitcher
Holy spirit penetrated my stone
Heart like the nails that were driven through your skin
I was smacked in the face with grace
Your righteousness given to me
I got a taste of your goodness
I'm not leaving I'm coming back for more and more
I spit out the slop I was eatin' on
Always left me dry
My bones have been made alive
From you breathing inside

Conversion, conversion
I crossed over the desert land
In your presence is where I stand now
Conversion, conversion
I was blinded swimming in my filthy
Now my heart has been turned to righteous
Righteous

I was a prisoner living in my prison
Of ignorance my mouth full of curses and bitterness
I was chained to my sin I was lovin'
Evil deeds in the dark
I was huggin' them tight
Close my eyes was clouded with lust for the adulteress
But her ways lead to death
I was on my way to hell
Ridin' on a train first class

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burdens of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith, I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burdens of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith, I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
And now I am happy all the day
And now I am happy all the day

I'm not the same man that I was
You stepped in and changed my heart
Now I'm walking the narrow road
Moved the scales from eyes
Transformed my soul
And now I see clear
You said, "Anyone to confess your name shall have life"
Now that I see, now that I see
And I want to be
