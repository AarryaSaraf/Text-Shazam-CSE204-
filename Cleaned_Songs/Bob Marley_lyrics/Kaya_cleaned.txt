// Kaya //

Wake up and
Wake up and
Wake up and turn I loose
For the rain is falling

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

I'm so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

I'm so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

Get up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose
For the rain is falling
Kaya man, kaya man
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is, rain is falling
Wake up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose

// Is This Love //

I wanna love you
And treat you right

Every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?

So I throw my cards on your table

I wanna love you, I wanna love and treat
Love and treat you right

Every day and every night
We'll be together, yeah
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah, oh-yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provides the bread

Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?

// Satisfy My Soul //

Oh, please don't you rock my boat (don't rock my boat)
Because I don't want my boat to be rocking (don't rock my boat)
Oh, please don't you rock my boat (don't rock my boat)
Because I don't want my boat to be rocking (don't rock my boat)

I'm telling you that, oh, oh-ooh, wo-o-wo!
I like it - like it this (I like it like this, I like it like this)
So keep it steady, like this. (I like it like this)
And you should know - you should know by now
I like it (I like it like this), I like it like this
(I like it like this, I like it like this)
I like it like this, ooh yeah! (I like it like this)

Satisfy my soul You satisfy my soul (satisfy my soul)
You satisfy my soul (satisfy my soul)
Every little action (satisfy my soul)
There's a reaction (satisfy my soul)
Oh, can't you see what you've done for me, oh, yeah
I am happy inside all - all of the time. Wo-oo-o-oo

When we (bend) bend a new corner
I feel like a (sweep) sweepstake winner
When I meet you around the corner ('round the corner)
You make me feel like a sweepstake winner (a sweep - a sweepstake winner)

Whoa, child! Can't you see? You must believe me
Oh darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
Can't you see? Why won't you believe me
Oh, darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
(Calling, calling, calling, calling)

When I meet you around the corner
Oh, I said, "Baby, never let me be a loner
And then you hold me tight, you make me feel all right
Yes, when you hold me tight, you made me feel all right

Whoa, child! Can't you see? You must believe me
Oh darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
Can't you see? Why won't you believe me
Oh, darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
(Calling, calling, calling, calling)

Satisfy my soul, that's all I want you to do
That's all I'll take from you, satisfy my soul

// She's Gone //

My woman is gone (woman is gone)
My woman is gone (woman is gone)

She had left me a note hanging on my door
She say she couldn't take it, she couldn't take any more
The pressure around me just couldn't see
She felt like a prisoner who needs to be free
Fools have tried, yeah - wise men have failed
Oh, listen to me, honey, life could never be another jail
Still we know now, we'll never see smoke without fire
And everyone you see has a heart desire

She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), she's gone, ye-ah
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard
Words that I never heard?
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard
Words that I never heard?

She made it through the exit (she just couldn't take it)
She made it through the exit (she just couldn't make it)
And, oh, my children, if you see me crying
My woman is gone
If you see me - if you see me - if you see me
If you see me crying
If you see me - if you see me - if you see me
If you see me crying

She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), she's gone, ye-ah
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard
Words that I never heard?
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard
Words that I never heard?

She's gone

// Misty Morning //

Misty mornin', don't see no sun
I know you're out there somewhere having fun
There is one mystery - yea-ea-eah - I just can't express:
To give your more, to receive your less
One of my good friend said, in a reggae riddim
"Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim."
The power of philosophy - yea-ea-eah - floats through my head
Light like a feather, heavy as lead
Light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah

See no sun! Oh
Time has come, I want you -
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow! Uh
I want - I want - I want you - (tomorrow)
Oh, wo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
I want you to straighten out my (tomorrow)!

Misty (morning) mornin', don't see no sun
I know you're out there somewhere having fun
Mysteries I just can't express:
How can you ever give your more to receive your less?
Like my good friend said, in a reggae riddim:
"You can't jump - you can't jump in the water, if you can't swim."

I want you (I want you) - I want you to straighten out my today -
My tomorrow - my-my-my - my - my
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
On a misty morning, uh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh!
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Straighten out my tomorrow - my tomorrow! Need some straightenin' out!
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Mist! Mm. (I want) Mist! (you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Misty! Oh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)

// Crisis //

They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all. Mm-mm-mm
They say love is a stream that will find its course
I mean some people think life is a dream
So they making matters worse

But no matter what the crisis is
No matter what the crisis is
Doing it, doing it, doing your thing
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Giving it, giving it, giving it, giving it
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

So - so - so much have been said, so little (been done) a little been done
They still killing - killing the people
And they - and they having (having their fun) - having-a - having-a lots of fun
Killing the people, oo-yoo! - (having fun) having their fun!
They just want to be the leader
In the house of the rising sun

But no matter what the crisis is
Oh, no, oh, no no - (no what the crisis is) no what the crisis is
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all. (Mm-mm-mm)
They say love is a stream that will find its course (Never ever)
Some people think life is a dream

No matter what the crisis is

Do it
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

// Running Away //

You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
But you can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself

You must have done (must have done)
Somethin' wrong (something wrong)
Said: you must have done (must have done)
Wo! Somethin' wrong (something wrong)
Why you can't find the
Place where you belong?
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)

Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
You still mean it: Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
But you can't run away from yourself
Could you run away from yourself?
Can you run away from yourself?
Can't run away from yourself!
Can't run away from yourself!
Yeah-eah-eah-eah - from yourself

Brr - you must have done somethin'
Somethin' - somethin' - somethin'
Somethin' you don't want nobody to know about:
You must have, Lord - somethin' wrong
What you must have done - you must have done somethin' wrong
Why you can't find where you belong?

Well, well, well, well, you running away, heh, no
You running away, ooh, no, no, no
I'm not (running away), no, don't say that - don't say that
'Cause (running away) I'm not running away, ooh! (running away)
I've got to protect my life, (running away)
And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion. (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left you; (running away)
Now you comin' to tell me (running away)
That I'm runnin' away. (running away)
But it's not true, (running away)
I am not runnin' away. (running away)

// Smile Jamaica //

Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then I came, the one that said
Hey Dread, fly Natty Dread

And smile (In Jamaica)
Want you to smile (In Jamaica)
Get it to together right now (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)

Soulful town, roots people
Said I see that you're having fun
Rockin' to the roots man rocker
Oh island in the sun

Oh Oh (In Jamaica)
Want you get it together (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)

Help the children, help us tonight
Oh lord help them decide
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well

Well well well well (In Jamaica)
C'mon and smile (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)
Get it together right now (In Jamaica)

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread
Fly Natty Dread

Help, help, help us tonight
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well

Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then it came, the one that said
Hey Dread, Fly Natty Dread

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread

In Jamaica
