It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talking to
Well, you (it's you), you (it's you), you I'm talking to now
Why do you look so sad, and forsaken?
When one door is closed, don't you know, other is open?

Would you let the system make you kill your brotherman?
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, Dread, no! Woo!
Would you make the system make you kill your brotherman?
(No, Dread, no!)
Would you make the system get on top of your head again?
(No, Dread, no!)
Well, the biggest man you ever did see was - was just a baby

In this life (in this life)
In this (in this life, oh sweet life):
Coming in from the cold!
We're coming in (coming in), coming in-a (coming in)
Coming in (coming in), ooh! (coming in)

In this (in this life, oh sweet life):
Coming in from the cold!
We're coming in (coming in), coming in-a (coming in)
Coming in (coming in), ooh! (coming in)
Coming in from the cold!

It's you, you, you I'm talking
Well, yes, you, bilyabong you! (it's you)
Ew! - you I'm talking to now
We-e-ell, why do you look so, look so, look so sad
Look so sad and forsaken?
Don't you know: When one door is closed - when one door is closed
Many more is open?

We-e-e-ell, would you let the system get on top of your head again?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Dread, no!
Would you let the system make you kill your brotherman?
No, Dread, no!
We-e-e-ell, would you make the system get on top of your head again?

// Real Situation //

Check out the real situation
Nation war against nation
Where did it all begin?
When will it end?

Well, it seems like: total destruction the only solution
And there aren't no use: no one can stop them now
Ain't no use: nobody can stop them now

Give them an inch, they take a yard
Give them a yard, they take a mile (ooh)
Once a man and twice a child
And everything is just for a while

Well, it seems like: total destruction the only solution
And there aren't no use: no one can stop them now
Ain't no use: nobody can stop them now

Check in the real situation (check it out, check it out)
Nation fight against nation
Where did it all begin? Wo-oo-o-o-oh!
Where will it end?

Well, it seems like: total destruction the only solution
And there aren't no use: no one can stop them now
Ain't no use: nobody can stop them now

There ain't no use: no one can't stop them now
Everybody struggling: ain't no use - ain't no use
Ain't no use you even try
Ain't no use: got to say 'bye-'bye!
Ain't no use! Ain't no - ain't no use: no one can stop them now
(No one can stop them now)

// Bad Card //

In a rub-a-dub style, rub-a-dub style
In a rub-a-dub style

// Could You Be Loved //

[Bob Marley:]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell, if what you're thinking isn't right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness, there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, wo yeah! And be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo yeah! And be loved?

[I Threes:]
The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you

[Bob Marley:]
Love your brotherman!

[I Threes:]
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

[Bob Marley {I Threes}:]
Don't let them change ya, oh!
(Scat singing)
Or even rearrange ya!
(Scat singing)
Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
{Ooh, ooh, ooh}
They say, only... only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive! Eh!

[Bob Marley:]
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, whoa yeah! And be loved?

[I Threes:]
Never miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied

// Forever Loving Jah //

We'll be forever loving Jah
We'll be forever loving Jah

Some they say see them walking up the street
They say we're going wrong to all the people we meet
But we won't worry, we won't shed no tears
We found a way to cast away the fears
Forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) There'll be no end

So, old man river, don't cry for me
I've got a running stream of love you see
So, no matter what stages, oh stages
Stages, stages they put us through
We'll never be blue
No matter what rages, oh rages
Changes, rages they put us through
We'll never be blue
We'll be forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
Forever and ever, yes, and forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
'Cause there's no end

Because only a fool lean upon
Lean upon his own misunderstanding, oh, yeah
And then what has been hidden
From the wise and the prudent
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
In everything, in every day, I say, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)

Because just like a tree planted
Planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruits
Bringeth forth fruits in due season
Everything in life got its purpose
Find its reason in every season
Forever, yeah!

(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
On and on and on and on
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We'll be forever, yes, yes we'll be forever
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
We got to be forever

// Redemption Song //

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look? Ooh!
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Whoa! Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them-ah can-ah stop-ah the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
All I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom
