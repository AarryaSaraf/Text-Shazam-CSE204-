// The Heat //

Bring the Heat! Bring the Heat!
Doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man
So I can treat you better

No I, I can't feel the Heat
Yet don't let it catch you
No, I, I can't feel the Heat
I know I can't catch you alone
I know I can't catch you alone

No, I can't finish my workout
I knew that the moment I run, honey
Won't help it make you better
Still I, I can't feel the Heat
Yeah, don't let it catch you
Don't, I, I can't feel the Heat
I know I can't catch you alone, no

Keep together
Stand on together
I know I can't catch you alone
I know I can't catch you alone
I I can't feel the Heat
Yeah
I know I can't catch you alone
Doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man, honey
So I can treat you better

// Accelerate //

I'm sick of has-beens coming home
Coming home to the world
And it's madness, who do you think you are?

So can I get the car to just start, please
Can I get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once
You see, please

And it's magic, and it's strong
I am strong in the morn
Yeah in the magic, if you knew who you are

So can I get the car to just start, please
Can I get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once
You see, please

Can I get the car to just start, please
Let me get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once to me
Yeah, me
So please

// Busy Earnin' //

So you come a long way
But you'll never have me
Never have things for a normal life
It's time to busy earnin'
You can't get enough

This busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
To busy learnin'
You can't get enough

And I get always
But I bet it won't change, no
Damn, that's a boring life
It's quite busy earnin'
You can't get enough

This busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
To busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
To busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
To busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough, no
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough

// Platoon //

Ooh brother
Ooh it's funny
How good you are

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

Under the ricks
Down by the beach
No, I'm not
Where you
Want me

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

I see the snake
Down by my feet
Walk on
Just you
Watch me

I'll knock you down
Brother, please
Go tell
Who you
Want to

Behind my back
And the love beneath
Whispered
Into
Nothing

// Drops //

When you're so high you (Don't think)
When you fall from the sky you (Won't break)

So come down from the clouds 
Come down 
So some down from the clouds 
Come down 

I've been loving you, too long
I've been loving you, for too long. 

So some down from the clouds 
Come down 
So some down from the clouds 
Come down 

When you're so high, you don't think 
When you fall from the sky, you won't break. 
I've been loving you too long. 
I've been loving you for too long.

It's calling on me
If what I see is true
To me your just a girl
And it's starting baby

Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

Are you mad about me?
Or do you see a fool?
To me your just the girl
Tell me
If it's starting baby
All I ever need

Too easy
All I ever need
Too cold
You'll be all I ever need
Too near me
All I ever need
Too slow
To me you're just the girl
You know that I could be the one
All I ever need
To get through
All I ever need

Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

Going on down there
So crawl up me baby
All I ever wanted tonight

Got to quicken up
Cos it's all or never now, again

You got a lot to show
Yeah but nobody's talking now

You're the shock I need
Gotta give me a go

It took him to his knees
So why are you giving up?

You can take it from my hands
I just watch you feed,
Cos I know what you think
About

I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
