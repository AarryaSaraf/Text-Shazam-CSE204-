// Come On! Let's Boogey To The Elf Dance! //

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro


Tie up your boots

Jump off the ladder

Pack up your clothes

Nothing's the matter

Mistletoe hangs up in the bedroom

Your sister's bangs

She cut them herself

Santa is here

Sleighbells are ringing

Twenty-one elves

They are all singing

K-Mart is closed

So is the bakery

Everyone's home watching TV


Santa Claus is coming

Hear the banjo strumming


Chestnuts and fire, holly and hay

Jesus and Mary, what a great day

Evergreen tree, covered in snow

Tower of Babel, tower of glow

There's Aunt Marie, hand on the fire

They give us good gifts

Like mittens and socks

Hijack a snow plow

Clear out the streets

Tell all of the neighbors

There's cookies to eat


Get up off the floor and give a shout

There's a lot to shout about

Santa Claus is coming to town

He's got the greatest gifts around

Away in a manger no crib for a bed

The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head

The stars in the sky looked downward where he lay

The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay

// We Three Kings //

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6


We three kings of Orient are

Bearing gifts we travel afar

Field and fountain, moor and mountain

Following yonder star


O Star of wonder, star of night

Star with royal beauty bright

Westward leading, still proceeding

Guide us to thy Perfect Light


Glorious now behold Him arise

King and God and Sacrifice

Alleluia, Alleluia

Earth to heav'n replies


O Star of wonder, star of night

Star with royal beauty bright

Westward leading, still proceeding

Guide us to thy perfect light

// O Holy Night //

Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth!

Long lay the world in sin and error pining

Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!


Fall on your knees

Oh hear the angel voices

Oh night divine

Oh night when Christ was born

Oh night divine

Oh night divine


Truly He taught us to love one another

His law is love and His gospel is peace

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother

And in His name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,

Let all within us praise His holy name.


Fall on your knees

Oh hear the angel voices

Oh night divine

Oh night when Christ was born

Oh night divine

Oh night divine

// That Was The Worst Christmas Ever! //

Going outside

Shoveling snow in the driveway, driveway

Taking our shoes

Riding a sled down the hillside, hillside

Can you say what you want?

Can you say what you want to be?

Can you be what you want?

Can you be what you want?


Our father yells

Throwing gifts in the wood stove, wood stove

My sister runs away

Taking her books to the schoolyard, schoolyard

In time the snow will rise

In time the snow will rise

In time the Lord will rise

In time the Lord will rise


Silent night

Holy night

Silent night

Nothing feels right

// All The King's Horns //

One mother rises
Pulling the sheets from the crib
All the disguises
Wandering stars, what she did
All the kings horns, all the kings horns
Saddled and worn
Raise the dead
Holy and infant
He came to raise up the dead

Wandering wisemen
What did you bring to his bed
Shapeless surprises
Incense to bring to the dead
Nothing is wrong, it's what she did
All the kings horns and kings men 
Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns and kings men

Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns raise the dead
Nothing is wrong its what she did
All the kings horns

// The Friendly Beasts //

Jesus our brother, strong and good

Was humbly born in a stable rude

And the friendly beasts around Him stood

Jesus our brother, strong and good


"I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown

"I carried His mother up hill and down

I carried His mother to Bethlehem town"

"I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown


"I," said the cow, all white and red

"I gave Him my manger for His bed

I gave Him my hay to pillow His head"

"I," said the cow, all white and red


"I," said the sheep with curly horn

"I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm

He wore my coat on Christmas morn"

"I," said the sheep with curly horn


"I," said the dove from the rafters high

"I cooed Him to sleep so that He would not cry

We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I"

"I," said the dove from the rafters high


Thus every beast by some good spell

In the stable dark was glad to tell

Of the gift he gave Emmanuel

The gift he gave Emmanuel
