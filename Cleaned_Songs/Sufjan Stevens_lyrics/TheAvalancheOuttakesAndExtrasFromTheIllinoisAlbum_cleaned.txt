// The Avalanche //

I call ye cabin neighbors

I call you once my friends

But I trust when you labor

And put my head to rest


But I was on the hatch

I was on the avalanche

And I had found my match

I was on the floor


I took a train from Virginia

To Illinois, my home

He said "I knew you had it in ya"

A mind to make its own


But I was on the hatch

Riding on the avalanche

I tried to take it back

I was on the floor


Come on, Stone!

Come on, Star!

Come on, Snow!

Come on, Car!

Come on, Hands!

Come on, Feet!

Come on, Face!

Come on, Street!

Come on, State!

Come on, Song!

Move it fast! (Take it up)

Move it along! (The Ohio River)

Come on, Life! (Take it up)

Come on, Lord! (Take it over)

Make it right! (To the Mississippi)

Make it Yours!

// Dear Mr. Supercomputer //

Oh my God

I can't believe it

What went wrong?

The human race, in its place

Superstition man's religion

And conditioned mysteries incomplete

And the raven with its haven

Gods-in-graven

Girls and boys Illinois

Springfield with its freak and banter

Strike the cantor

God is dead, God is dead


Oh my God I can't believe it

What went wrong? 

The human race, in its place

In religion, superstition

Man's conditoined mysteries incomplete


(Superman, Old machines

Kind as that, Energenes

Good as dead, Man-Machines

Computer, effigy

Sound the horn, make the bed

Pull the cord, raise the dead

In my car, on this street

On this earth, on this feet)


Take it for a patient man I caught it

Patient is the kind that gets you paid

Even if I had, man, I got it

Seems I never had it anyway

Sometimes it may seem your best intentions

Take off with a fever anyway


1-2-3-4-5-6-7 All computers go to heaven

If you think you got the vision,

Put it in the conversation

1-2-3-4-5-6-7 All computers go to heaven

If you think you got the vision,

Put it in the conversation


I rejoice in what I carry in my heart

it overwelms what a man

Great Emancipation plans,

and public transport, clap your hands, Abraham

Oh religion, superstition,

Man's conditioned mysteries incomplete

Oh the Raven with its haven

Gods-in-graven

All is dead, all is dead

// Adlai Stevenson //

Righteous men of the earth

Oh, have you been patient

I suppose our thoughts about United Nations


Adlai, Adlai

What did he say

And what is the answer?


1952, the heart was not your master

The accident you threw

Would carry through your laughter


Evidence, evidence

I've heard of it

And what is the answer?


Adlai, Adlai

Your holiday

The greatest of men, sir


Adlai, Adlai

What did he say

And what is the answer?

// Chicago (Acoustic Version) //

I fell in love again

All things go, all things go

Drove to Chicago

All things know, all things know

We sold our clothes to the state

I don't mind, I don't mind

I made a lot of mistakes

In my mind, in my mind


I drove to New York

In a van with my friend

We slept in parking lots

I don't mind, I don't mind

I was in love with the place

In my mind, in my mind

I made a lot of mistakes

In my mind, in my mind


You came to take us,

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mind set

All things know, all things know

You had to find it


All things go, all things go


All things go


If I was crying,

In the van with my friend

It was for freedom

From myself and from the land

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes


You came to take us,

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mind set

All things know, all things know

You had to find it

All things go, all things go

// The Henney Buggy Band //

Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror

From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there

In the car when your mother lost her temper

The catalog and the catastrophic smile


Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid

I kissed you on the face

I kissed you on the playground


Oh Father John, you cannot tell me

What's right and wrong

You cannot tell me

I jump before I get around you

Oh Father John


Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway

(Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself)


Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway

Forget about yourself and all your plans


Oh life, with your colorful surprises

Eleanor, how you put one on disguises


Oh Father John, you cannot tell me

What's right and wrong

You cannot tell me


In the mortal life

Far in the morning light

We're back from Bloomington

We let the runners win


Far in the morning light

We let the movies play

A weekend from the holiday


Pick it up with the band 

On the Ronald Reagan toll way

(Don't break down, let's go... forget about yourself)


Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way

(If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself)


Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around

Forget about yourself and all your plans

// Saul Bellow //

What's the worth of

All the work of my hands,

And the worst off

On Lake Michigan?


Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.


And my good friends

With their eyes on what it takes.

I could kiss them,

But the bravest make mistakes.


Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

Get in solid walls and with what it caused.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

Get in solid walls with the know-it-alls.

Get in trouble with Saul Bellow.

// Carlyle Lake //

Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow

Don't stop thinking of today

You're not getting any younger

You've got nothing to explain

You've got resolutions

Fastening in your wake

Take instead the high tide

At the man-made lake

It may take a while

It may take all day

All the implications

At the man-made lake

Oh stop thinking of tomorrow...

// Springfield, Or Bobby Got A Shadfly Caught In His Hair //

I don't care to say what

I failed to recognize

Every single day from the poker to the prize

Running out of Springfield

I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags

Found a woman there who said

she had a mind to make

me a messenger man


If my father took his life

for the national plan, I don't care

I'm not about to stick my grave with an

apron and a bucket of plans, never ever

I can take the pillow cases

off the yellow pillows,

make a property line from the bed

In the living room, the living room,

the morning papers made the most

out of nothing at all


So we took the room

with a view of the runaway

I took off my clothes,

and she took it for a holiday

I was taken for all the things

that I never had before

Running out of Springfield

she left me with a note saying:

"Bobby, don't look back."


And if my wife took a bicycle ride

with a knife in her hand

I saw it coming

All the shad-flies run at once

with a trumpet or a train,

oh I'm running from it


Wait a minute, wait a minute,

Give a minute, lady

I can explain the aftershave

Wait a minute, wait a minute,

give a minute

Bobby got a shad fly

caught in his hair

// The Mistress Witch From Mcclure (Or, The Mind That Knows Itself) //

And the winter moves about Illinois

When my sister picks a fight

With the Alexander boy

And my father locks the car by the store

Still we figure out the keys

And follow him once more

Oh my God, we see it on the floor

The woman on the bed

The ankle brace she wore

Stones and sled

It could have been some other

The mind that knows itself

Has a mind to serve the other

But we run back, scratching at the door

Scratching at the door


If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat

When my father runs undressed

He's pointing at my throat

And my brother has fit in the snow

And the traffic stops for miles

We take him by the elbow

Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor

A mind that knows itself

Is a mind that knows much more

So we run back, scrambling for cover

The mind that knows itself

Has a mind to kill the other

(Oh my God, no one came to our side

To carry us away from danger)


Oh my God

He left us now for dead

He left us now for dead

// Chicago (Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version) //

I fell in love again

All things go, all things go

Drove to Chicago

All things know, all things know

We sold our clothes to the state

I don't mind, I don't mind

I made a lot of mistakes

In my mind, in my mind


You came to take us

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mindset

All things know, all things know

You had to find it

All things go, all things go


I drove to New York

In the van, with my friend

We slept in parking lots

I don't mind, I don't mind

I was in love with the place

In my mind, in my mind

I made a lot of mistakes

In my mind, in my mind


You came to take us

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mindset

All things know, all things know

You had to find it

All things go, all things go


If I was crying

In the van, with my friend

It was for freedom

From myself and from the land

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes

I made a lot of mistakes


You came to take us

(If I was right or wrong I)

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

(Had my friend along the way)

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mindset

(?)

All things know, all things know

You had to find it

(?)

All things go, all things go


You came to take us

All things go, all things go

To recreate us

All things grow, all things grow

We had our mindset

(I made a lot of mistakes)

All things know, all things know

(I made a lot of mistakes)

You had to find it

(I made a lot of mistakes)

All things go, all things go

(I made a lot of mistakes)

// No Man's Land //

Up in the highest of heights

O'Hara blinks and fights

This land is yours; this land is mine.

I see the Captain in red,

and Cairo at his head.

This land is yours; this land is mine.


The lightning over the park,

the waters--brash and dark

We take a swim; we take a swim.

I never meant to escape

the carpet and the trade

This land is yours; this land is mine.


And when I make up my mind

I change it all the time

I take it back; I take it back.

The numbers over the dam,

Jo Davies and the band,

I count them out; I count them out.


There was a car in the bay

by the boat that swept and swayed

Whoever you are in the light

in the water that we made

I'm counting it out

I'm counting it out

I'm working it out inside

I'm counting it out

to the floor


The ferry hatches Moline

Panola Beauty Queen

She takes a bow; she takes a bow.

In Charles, we climb the hill 

and Danville window sill

I take it back; I take it back.

My sister she counts the bars,

the Macon county cars,

She takes a bow; she takes a bow.


The Mississippi amends

the Carver and the bends

This land is yours; this land is mine.

My brother punches my ear.

The injured ivory deer

I call my dad; I call my dad.

We skip inside of the store

the Mason winter door

This land is yours; this land is mine.


There was a car in the bay

by the boat that swept and swayed

Whoever you are in the light

in the water that we made

I'm holding your hand by the shore

With our collars pulled up tight

I'm counting it out

I'm counting it out

I'm working it out inside

I'm counting it out


(This land is not your land

For the right hand takes what it can,

ransacks with the mad man.

For this land is not yours or mine to have.

This land was made for the good of itself.)

// The Pick-Up //

All things past in the pick-up

Found my brother's badge

Abraham is live and well in the pick-up

And his wife casts no more spells

In the pick-up


Found myself in the pick-up

Seatbelt on my lap

And my sister with her braids

In the pick-up

Kissed my mother on the face

In the pick-up

Clapping with the human race

In the pick-up

// The Perpetual Self, Or 'What Would Saul Alinsky Do?' //

Everything is lost, uh-oh

But I know that you can take it to the Lord

Everything you are, uh-oh

Isn't all that you can gather for yourself


Do you love a lot? Uh-oh

Is it love that you just kiss to everyone?

Is your loving lost? Uh-oh

Is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?

(All that he has given to the world

Is the joy that he will carry to the door)


All that he has given to the world

All that he has given to the world

(Uh-oh, is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?)

All that he has given to the world

(For what it costs, uh-oh)

All that he has given to the world

(Everything is lost, uh-oh)

All that he has given to the world

(Is the joy that he will carry to the door)

All that he has given to the world

(Still I know that you can take it to the war)

// Pittsfield //

I'm not afraid of you now, I know

So I climbed down from the bunk beds this low


I can talk back to you now, I know

From a few things I learned from this TV show


You can work late till midnight, we don't care

We can fix our own meals, we can wash our own hair


I go to school before sunrise, in the cold

And I pulled the alarm, and I kicked up the salad bowls


Since the time we meant to say much

Unsaid things begin to take their toll

After school we shoveled through the snow

Drive upstate in silence in the cold


You can remind me of it

That I was lazy and tired

You can work all your life as

I'm not afraid of you anymore


If I loved you a long time, I don't know

If I can't recall the last time you told me so


Here in this house in Pittsfield

The ghost of our grandmother works at the sewing machine post

Hiding the bills in the kitchen on the floor

And my sister lost her best friend in the Persian Gulf War 

There was a flood in the bathroom last May

And you kicked at the pipes when it rattled oh the river it made


Stand there, tell me that I'm of no use

Things unspoken break us if we share

There's still time to wash the kitchen floor

On your knees, at the sink once more

You can remind me that I was tired

You can work late and give yourself up

Now that I'm older, wiser, and working less

I don't regret having left the place a mess


You can remind me that I was lazy and tired

You can recall your life as 

I'm not afraid of you, anymore

Anymore
