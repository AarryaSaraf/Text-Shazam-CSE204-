// Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone //

There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name

Leave me alone,
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
As long as you're something to own

Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you

// Someone Is Waiting //

Someone is waiting
To swallow all the halos out of you
As your face blows
Through my windows
Sending pieces flying all around the room

And I love you
And I want to
Shoot all the superheroes from your skies
Watch them bleeding
From your ceiling
As their empty anger falls out from their eyes
All alone...

// Song Against Sex //

And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, "Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream - 
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind 
So I'm always sober
Always aching 
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you...
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving - 
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.

// You've Passed //

The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing 
Through the hospital wall and away

And I wanted to hold you 
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you 
When your eyes were alive and awake
Always in life we all must make this mistake

And so I go it alone 
And the pressure is great 
I hold on to my own
Oh, please - oh, don't go away

I wanted to know you 
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake
Always in life we all must make this mistake

And so I go it alone 
And the pressure is great 
I hold on to my own
Oh, please - oh, don't go away
I'd like to see you when all of these angry days flow away

// A Baby For Pree //

Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets as soft as beets
In some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath,
And the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest
With a force hard and beating,
'Till wonderfully wet she will get 
Until she's soaked inside her clothes. 
And there is no sorry to be sorry for,
For a roll around the floor
Some afternoon so sound and soft,
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs,
And when the day it came to pour
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more.

// Where You'll Find Me Now //

All I perceive is wasted and broken
Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
Slam into me and into the ditch of debris.
And you smoke in the park, you sleep in the greenery,
Everyone barks but all still believing
To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me,

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
Tear into me and the scent of you sweating
Smells good to me, as long as we keep in our clothes
And out in the dark, the world is still rolling,
Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
And all that they are, just reeks with the sweetest belief.

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

All I could want is silver and spinning
Out from your arms and into the pretty 
Pit of your heart - so simply and softly we'd flow.

But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk.

Into you I will glow.
Into you.

// Three Peaches //

There is no dream, so wake up 
Run your lips across your fingers till you find 
Some scent of yourself that you can hold up high 
To remind yourself that you didn't die 
On a day that was so crappy - whole and happy, you're alive

And you seem so bruised
And it's beautiful as it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you, but they found you 
And they took you, and you somehow survived

There is no dream, so wake up
And if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
Then press yourself against whatever 
You find to be beautiful and trembling with life
Because I'm so happy that you didn't die

// Naomi //

Your prettiness is seeping through
Out from the dress I took from you
So pretty
And my emptiness is swollen shut
Always a wretch - I have become 
So empty 
And please, please don't leave me

I'm watching Naomi, full bloom
I'm hoping she will soon explode
Into one billion tastes and tunes 
One billion angels come and hold her down 
They could hold her down until she shines

I'm tasting Naomi's perfume
It tastes like shit and I must say
She comes and goes most afternoons
One billion lovers wave and love her now 
They could love her now and so could I

There is no Naomi in view 
She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls
And if she only really knew 
One billion angels could come and save her soul 
They could save her soul until she shines

So pretty

And please, please don't leave me here.
