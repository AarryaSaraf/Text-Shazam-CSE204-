Fo' shizzle bizzle, here we go again


Freshly dressed, I jump up in the mo'nin' tryna find some Zest

Psyche, we like the Bom, somebody betta ring the alarm

And hit the folks at the forum

Let my homies off the yard

I shall see the head nigga in charge

Push... Bush outta office, dump 'til they get off us

Make them offers, that leave niggas in coffins

[Goldie Loc]

Can you feel it my nigga, I'm 'bout to kill it my niggas

Sound like guerillas, fo' real'a off gangsta government millas

Coke killas, when it comes to off mic'n wit me

I was branded in a gang, fuck havin' techniques

Just ride, not a damn lettin' these fools breathe

Pop peas, push keys, find a stash fo' yo cheese

Is it possible that laws might get jealous

Hell yeah they be hatin' on the 3 Good Fellas

[Tray Deee]

Over-dosage of ferocious, WestCoast in effect

Bang straight gangsta shit, so you know it's on deck

Hold and respect, cold as it get, don't wanna test

Kidnap ya wife and ya kids, you get the message

Insanity, commanded me to savagely spit

Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it quick

No talkin', C-Walkin', we chokin' the block off

And throwin' up DoggHouse 

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

Don't you shoot that little mothafucka no mo'

That ain't what he said when he hit the chest went through his heart, came out his elbow

You shouldn't have been talkin' that shit bitch boy

Sayin' the wrong thing against the real McCoy

Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta

If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata

[Tray Deee]

We exploded, reloaded and sewed it up

Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump

Keep this mothafucka jumpin' 'til they close it up

Then we dippin' wit a sip and some hoes to fuck

Pour late, the hard way, ain't no bustas here

So explict you can only get it once a year

Eastsidaz, the ridaz, they change the game

And let you know from here go, we straight came to bang

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]

Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you

Ever see someone here, who gave a fuck about you?

Niggas on the streets gon' keep talkin' shit about you

As long as you clap fool, it's bigger than 'bout too

Fuck wit fools, that ain't never paid us

And try to turn the homies into traitaz

Blue rags with blue balls, fo' all you hataz

I shoot a shout out to the killas

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

WestCoast niggas and we all in yo house

Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out

Eastside ridaz and we all in yo mouth

Dogg Pound Gang we let the mothafuckin' doggs out

Always got a bitch, but never in the front seat

Still the same let the mothafuckin' doggs out

// Crip Hop //

[Chorus: Tray Deee]

I'm tired of that punk shit

Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit

I bang it to the tip-top

Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks

To the last drip-drop

To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks

I'm knowin that this shit hot

This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

[Tray Deee]

It's time to research the documents and pull some files

and put it down with this gangsta style

Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now

after peace treaty meetings and the weapons down

Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals

To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless

To manage this dramaticness I call my rep

Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check

Certified murder guide through the streets of death

Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met

From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash

Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast

Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag

Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs

Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock

Lick shots and the cops and control your block

Keep it true with the crew from the old to new

Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do

Notice who, participatin all the activity

That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies

So death to all my enemies

And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy

These weak niggaz killin me

with their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]

Yeah nigga this crip, crip, crip

Talk shit and I'ma bust yo' lip

I'm gettin chips in the summer in a nine-six Hummer

in D.C., fuckin with a breezy, easy

See we see all we can see

G.R. we can G, the Eastside family

Coherent, cohesive, the co-pilot

On this Eastside shit cuz, I'm co-signin

On the East fuck peace we ridin violent

Fuck where you been it's all about where I been

Sirens, gunshots, flood glocks get popped

when they all try to knock knock knock

Who is it - visit the papers, the streets and the labels

We got the hottest shit burnin on the turntables

I won't deny ya, I'm a straight rider

and you don't wanna fuck with me (yeh yeh)

[Chorus]

[Goldie Loc]

C.. R.. I.. P.. cause that's all we G

I'm from Rollin', 20, Gangsta Crip

and I'ma tell you how the shit gon' C (gon' C)

Now if I wasn't rappin motherfucker y'all be starvin

on my nuts without bucks like Marvin

You can't sleep, you can't eat, look who starvin

Written bill paid but still gotta be a slave

Flip your own money, make your own proper

Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya

Be a boss hog about your money, float loc

And trust no one, anybody can get smoke smoked

like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit

Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!

Niggaz ran in with toys

If you didn't see 'em it's the Eastside boys

We be mobbin, like a motherfuckin cut

Dirty dealt, lil' sag, lil' jay, lil' Chuck

Two times, trey times on yo' motherfuckin ass

Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass

It's just another day and forty dozen, niggaz strugglin

Is you hustlin, do you relate to drug smugglin?

If so, grab a nine and start to trip

But remember, don't let nobody punk you out yo' grip nigga

[LaToiya Williams]

Dogg Pound groovin, Eastside is the greatest

and other guys can't fade us

cause we're the hardest in the town

(?) and duces, never could be faded

And all you suckers hate it

Ohh crip is goin down

And baby have no doubt, we gonna turn it out

And that's on Eastside L.B.C.

And we're the best, we rockin coast to coast

and we be blowin dope, and baby that's the shit

I'm talkin real shit to ya baby (that real crip shit)

Duces 'n trayz bangin (that real crip shit)

Duces 'n trayz, bangin bangin bangin bangin (THAT CRIP!)

[Snoop Dogg]

Eastside.. ahh!  Eastside, Eastside

// Friends //

[Kokane]

Life is much mo' precious

Than you'll think

Like a game'll make yo chips sink

It's so hard

Hard to trust a smile and face

When niggas got intentions already taking yo place

Keep my head up and stand tall

If I stumble, then I'll fall

Will you pick me up at all?

Will you pick me up at all?

I'm a keep it gangsta till my end

Cause some people do pretend

And ain't too many of us that we can call friends

That we can call friends

Ohhhhhhh

[Goldie Loc]

Now all I gotta do is keep my head up

And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind

But I'm kind-hearted

And don't like being stepped on

If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position

Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say

I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day

Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody

But you know what I never do?

Smoke it off like Gotti

Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones

Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone

I never threaten nobody to make it happen

Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'

But if I had a chance to give it back

I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that

Do that, straight from the heart

Eastside till I die

We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life

[Tray Deee]

It's a trip how we Crip

Suppose the enemies still

With both sides ride causing plenty of tears

Insane's and 20's both from the same city

A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many

Me, C, and the G can think back to the start

Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park

And having a heart

To get 'em up if it was beef

Head up like G's, take it out in the street

Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view

So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few

But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case

And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase

You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke

A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close

And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now

Cause I could never see you doing bad without

And that's real

[Kokane]

Life is much mo' precious

Than you'll think

Like a game'll make yo chips sink

It's so hard

Hard to trust a smile and face

When niggas got intentions already taking yo place

Keep my head up and stand tall

If I stumble, then I'll fall

Will you pick me up at all?

Will you pick me up at all?

I'm a keep it gangsta till my end

Cause some people do pretend

And ain't too many of us that we can call friends

That we can call friends...

// Now Is The Time //

[Kokane & {Snoop Dogg}]

Oh.......Chassa-dee

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

From the LBC

Chassa-dee

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

La da da da da da da

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

From the LB....LB

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

[Tray Deee]

What up cuz? You know aint nothin different on mines

When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes

It's a statement that I'm makin and aint takin no backtalk

I'm blowin niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough

The last thought you rappin niggaz should think

Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat

On the streets over beef you dont compete with uno - you know

The general a criminal do low

Admit cuz I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it

Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin

By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate

A true rider with the mind - I pushed him outta his way

Fools petty and they ready steady comin with bullshit

A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick

A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast

Motherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash

[Chorus:  Snoop Dogg]

Now is the time

This is the place

To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace

West is the coast, east is the side

Long Beach is the city where them gangstas ride

Money brings power, power brings respect

Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech

This is how it goes and thats how it's done

Eastside 2-1 in the land of the fun

[Tray Deee]

Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait

I came home straight from the pen to take your place

Aint no chase this paper comin soon as I post up

And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin his dough up

Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up

Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative

I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike

Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight

Insane mental frame feel no shame or pitty

Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city

Trippin gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat

Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep

This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal

Kobe eatin what he speakin once he cant get the muzzle

Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it

You want it? Then all invitations open

[Chorus]

[Tray Deee]

I take seven old B's put 'em in the street

Then thats seven more busta's who claim they got heat

And then it takes seven more C's before I start to reach

Then thats 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets

Tray Deee never do it easy fool so dont expect it

Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected

No question I'm all you ever thought that you was

Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin up blood

Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust

Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up

All they talkin cause I'm chalkin whole districts off

Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off

Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched

All my comrads bomb back it's as sick as fuck

2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf

Check the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse

[Chorus]

[Kokane & {Snoop Dogg}]
[Kokane mumbling until the end]

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}

And keep it clean, and stay oh so mean

So rough so tough, haha

[Suga Free]

What his here? This for them suckas

Nigga I came from a long line of playas

That's why yo raggety-ass attitude is fucked up now

Suga Freeeeee......hahaha

Bitch swingin' on my dick sayin WEEEEE!

Now them 70 niggas? 30 gon' hate us

That's why I play the role, keep control

and throw them off wit' these dirty gators

See time was torn

Cuz if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit

BUT NOW?! You'd rather bring me down and see me fall

Walkin' wit my head down straight dependin' on y'all

[Soopafly]

Am I a star? NO Ya' in my car? NO

Now heffer don't act stupid, cuz y'know who I am

The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn

I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram

Better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that

Now blow me back while I'm pimpin on this funky track

Bang E.S. we givin' it up got the bitches singin' the rest

We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest

No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast (so fast)

Fuck wit' us I'll put a foot up yo ass

[Ruff Dogg]

Collect calls from the pen, so I catch it in the kitchen

The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches

And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jackup

That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our DaDa's

and ask them niggas in the Source Awards when I caught them

while y'all was pacin', the homies was bringin' up situations

Eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

[Chorus]

[Snoop and Kokane]

Dogghouse (woof) in ya mouth (we'll make you go away)
[Repeat 4X]

[Kurupt]

Yeah nigga, Dogghouse, this Kurupt bitch, yeah


OK, let the homies spray the K

Dippin hittin' switches bouncin' over ditches

Callicodes collapse niggas, perhaps niggas

Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'M YOUNG GOTTSTRA

Put it up, pistols might sizzle a nigga

For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga

LIke a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle

surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle

Who you thought we was? Temperatures might rise

Before everybody feel the fire from the 5's

I told Daz we about to fry niggas like fries

And seperate them by 5's, and light up the skies

Crip that D.P., K-U-R-U-P-T

Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth

Dogghouse gangstas (woof, woof, woof, woof)

Dippin' and I'm out, put a dick in yo mouth, ya bitch

[RBX]

Like this, for the sake of the game

Bitch nigga jaw-jackin' get ?blasted? out the frame

Let them punk punk you up

You jumped up and got stomped the fuck down, what now?

Showdown, got your three ring circus Bozo's

cannot work or see the tears of a clown

Listen nit wit, you can't get wit

try to sit wit, and get yo shit split quick

If you wanna say the word is bond

word is bond, then, I attack like ninja hunter

You rhyme soft like the other Hunter

Heather Hunter, fake a gangbang fronter

Capital D to the O-G-G

Capital H-O-U-S-E in ya mouth, oh bitch if ya didn't know

Long Beach City dirty like THE SOUTH!

[King Lou]

?Wit Suga Free in? I'm in this motherfucker leanin'

I'm quick to do it umm, meant to do it

Stayed on my toes like the nigga pimpin', watching the corner

Much love to my niggas rippin', in California

Doin it big with my nigga Bad, these niggas mad

At the 2001 Benz, guzzlin' Henn

It's Dogghouse and we all in, ballin'

Goldie got a couple of hoes hoppin' out the Rolls, we chillin

[Goldie Loc]

I came in bangin dub ?minutes? (20 minutes)

All my niggas know I ain't no motherfucking gimp

I get down damn, runnin' from damn town

Dogghouse nigga, Dogg Pound bound

How you motherfuckers like me now when I do it like

Bust on the microphone, cuss on the microphone?

Yeah this nigga like Tracy, Tray Deee

Bang his ass, slap his ass in the striz-neet

Catch him wit the headlock, pistol whippin' wit the glock

Lil' Goldie Loc about to set up shop

These motherfuckers don't like me anyway

Shit, I ain't got nothing to say, wit no time to play

What these motherfuckers thought I was about?

When I bust this bitch i put my dick in her mouth

Now all them niggas got something to say

But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga

[Tray Deee]

Yeah it's the genius of the click

Known to sleep a nigga quick

So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist

I drew the diagram how to mash the game

Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap

I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act

I got stripes and bars from a life at war

Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks

For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats

Do or die, to survive from my time of birth

Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

It's going down, Dogghouse gangsta style

And fuck Death Row, we'll take 'em out

We got the whole rap game bangin' now (C--RIP!!)

What you motherfuckers think this game's about?

[Chorus]
[Repeat 8x]

[Mixmaster Spade]

Oh, good evening Topp Dogg I'm so glad you're here

All the bitches in the front, the gangsters in the rear

I'm not Dr. Jekyll nor Mr. Hyde

Whoever told you that, they told you a lie

You been a waitin' and a waitin', as I can see

So treat me like the pope and bow to your knees

Oh the genius on the mic is back again

So get on the phone and go tell a friend

I been a waitin' for a while as you all know

And now I'm back on the mic doggin' the show

I got platinum 'round my neck, that will never fade

The name of the chain's Mixmaster Spade

A sure shot, body rockin'

A c'mon everybody get ready to rock

A sure shot, body rockin'

A c'mon everybody..............

Stay mashin on bustas not givin a fuck

[Chorus - Snoop Dogg, Kokane]

Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep

We connected

From the West to the East

Oh what you got beef?

[Kokane] Yeah [repeat 30X]

[Verse 2 - Havoc, Goldie Loc]

[Havoc]

Connect wit my dogs be that serious shit

Serious things when M-O-B and sidaz bang

Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs

And pressure to that ass we apply those thangs

Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours

Its a cold ,cold, cold world nigga its Doggy Dogg

Better walk or crawl(for real), cause on the real homeboy

Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue

Moms praisin the lords, rev paintin the picture

Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture

We keep it gangsta nigga, don't get it twisted nigga

Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missin nigga

QB and we trully, rep for ours

Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips

When it came to this game though we changed the shit

And fuck who you wit, its what you up in the club but yo

[Goldie Loc]

Uzis, AKs, Glock 40s and Tech 9s

Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead muthafucka

Come up short, wit yo life on support

Burnin rubber down the street in a black super spoke

Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome

Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose

Real talk, show you how to walk the walk

All black all times when I scheme and stalk

Its somethin about bein a cold blooded killa

I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass guerilla

I'm G'd up, smokin all the muthafuckin weed up

Drinkin on a full cup nigga

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]

Yeah, defintely connected

How you love that?

Uh, like I said you can't spell the West wit out the ES

East side up eastsidaz

From QB to the LB

You see what I see and G how I G

Feel me?

Eastsidaz, duces and trayz the old fashioned way

Alchemist...

Uh, yeah-yay

// Mac Bible Chapter 211 Verse 20-21 //

[Mac Minista]

There's a scripture in the Mac Bible that says

'He that trusts a ho, shall surely be broke'

'Pressure busts a pipe that make water run uphill'

Alotta you niggas talk that shit

But half you niggas ain't real

Will the real niggas stand up and be counted

Or lay down and be mounted

Cuz this game is not a playground, it's a classroom

It's not a holiday, but an educational process

And experience is your greatest teacher

So listen to the gangsta mack preacher

Macks do what they want, bustas do the best that they can

From half of a gangstas start, is a sucka's dream

In the game God said, that he would send a G

With the street ethnics and G-Code

With the gangsta Ten Commandments

And the gangsta Ten Commandments shall read:

'Thou shall kill a snitch'

'Thou shall check a bitch'

'Thou shall charge a ho'

'Thou shall send a sucker'

'Thou shall respect the G'

'Thou shall pack that steel'

'Thou shall keep it real'

'Thou shall flex his G's'

'Thou shall stack his green'

'Thou shall stay true to his game'

See I'm a gangsta, not a prankster

I don't pull rabbits out of my hat

But I will pull a strap from behind my back

Now how 'bout that!

// Break A Bitch Til I Die //

[Snoop Dogg]

Pimp

Its pimp shit, its pimp shit

Nigga said his bitch took him to court for child support

Its cheaper to keep her

Cheaper to keep her

Thats real talk

Cheaper to keep her

Thats real talk, its cheaper to keep her

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

Now if you don't think I know what the fuck i'm talkin bout

(What you talkin bout?)

Run down to the Dogg House, and see fo' yo own two eyes

Bitches try to pull snake moves to get a piece of the pie

[Hook]

Its impossible, to stop a ho

So let her go, and get the dough

Lead the way, or step aside

Break a bitch till the day I die

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

Check me out, no doubt, I flip the game and re-route

I check her in wit Magic Man Juan, or Pimpin Ken

I just got back from Milwaukee, the All-Star game

Not the NBA nigga, i'm talkin real playa shit mayne

Macks, ballas, hustlas, and prostitutes

On the real my nig, you got to, got to get the loot

And if you got to shoot to get the loot

Then I guess you got to do what you gotta do

But know this, fa sho this, its somethin for realler

From a fifty cent nigga to a thousand dollar nigga

Fuck George Bush, the army, and the G.I.

Nigga this P.I., until I D.I.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]

Now don't get mad when you see me wit ya girlfriend

She ridin shot gun, smokin the damn thang again

Now say it ain't true...

Baby you gank em and play em it ain't no ring on you

That ain't what I do, just because I spend time wit you

Don't really mean i'm lyin to you

You got to understand what this young pimp will say

Cause right about now, it ain't no time for play

Now watch me slap ya ass wit dicks, bitch

You was stricly dickly, why you turn clitly

Thats even better, now both of you bitches lick me

Then I sit back and watch y'all eat pussy

Kick off my feet and count my cheese

Snoop this ain't the XLF, this the P-I-M-P

Look, she think she burned out

Wait until I put her on the fast track and have her turned out

P.I!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tray Deee]

Lil pretty skinny ass bitch, but she gotta monkey

I know she suck dicks cause her lips nice and puffy

But she got the wrong thought, kinda got me turned off

Must be why she sweatin me, the ectasy she gon off

For realler, ho don't know i'm bout that scrilla

I peel her like a sunkiss for comin wit that dumb shit(stupid bitch!)

I keeps the P.I., poppin fa sho

Other suckas tend to love em, we just cop em and blow

Hos come, hos go, hos runnin ya slow

So keep her foot up in her ass, unless a dick in her throat

Main grew bitch will go what I make ya do

And keep ya eyes on my Stacys while i'm lacin you

Ya like sex and shit, and gettin naked quick

Ya lil wreckless bitch, so gon and check them chips

And bring every penny back home and deck

And pull a couple of mo' hos you know that wanna get wrecked

[Chorus]

[Hook]

// Sticky Fingers //

[Hook - 2x : Ric Rock]

Sticky fingers is the one I love

I love him, I love you

[Tray Deee]

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Sometimes I just look at how you buy me things 

Before I split you wide open and I take a whif

You so fine and now that you mind, it's that time

I'm holdin' on you close, can't wait to be kind

Slowly dig you out and spread you 'cross the sheet

Run my fingers through your hair, 'til you soft and sweet

As you clingin' to my fingers, time to get you hot

Wrap you up real tight, then I lick the top

Got you properly positioned to consume you whole

But I know as we together I'ma lose control

Any way I spark the flame and the games commence

As your aroma take over I get faded quick

See you fill me with a feeling so fulfilling it's thrillin'

That without you it's about to be a reason for livin'

I spend my last cash, even chose to fight

But yet I would even share if the mood is right

Let's get high

[Hook - 1x: Ric Rock]

Sticky fingers is the one I love

I love him, I love you

[Kokane]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah (You feel so good)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Goldie Loc]

Where my grinder at?

Where my grinder at?

So I can breakdown some Colombian black

Can't find my tire, so I use my 'tibs

Twist it up in some chocolate, now hit this shit

... And hold it in for about 20 seconds

Now how the hell you'd get "Mary Jane" naked?

Watch me light the cigarette up, I bet it burn out

Now hit some of this shit nigga, it get you turned out

Make you wanna jump back and kiss ya'self

Solo blunt to the neck, I don't need no help

But if I run to a bad bats, it's just anotha dollar loss

In time to pop my coller, 'til I pop a coller off

Situation sticky, no need for being picky

Don't touch ya face, the crystals make you itchy

Who's the theif that stole ya keef?

I had to smash on the teeth, right down the streets

You know why?

[Hook - 1x: Ric Rock & Kokane]

Sticky fingers is the one I love

I love him, I love you

[Kokane]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Late Night //

[Snoop Dogg] 

[talking while singing "Late night"]


Yeah, baby, I'm just out here trying to get this money...

I mean it's hard.. hustling late night

You know (late niight)

Some of these suckas out there tryna get what I got

Tryna pull me down (late night)

But you know.. I'm a real playa

Real hustler.. real gangsta

I'm bout getting this money (late night)

I don't give a fuck what time it is..

It can go down all night..

[Tray Deee]

Button up the honcho, grab the brownies and heat

First step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat

The squares asleep

But all the hogs out on the prowl

Blocks get locked down like they off a child

Time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes

Checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white

Dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks

Getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips

Baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss

So the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft

Late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two

With fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you

Impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming

The vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining

9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising

Occupation gangsta committed to thug life

[Kokane]

On a late night..

That's the time we gone ride

Nigga, it's do or die

Late night

We ain't checking for names

When the hollow points fly

On a late night..

Deeper and deeper

We had to get into some gangsta shit

Late night

Deeper and deeper

They don't know who they fucking wit

[Goldie Loc]

Dead bodies with a funky smell

Throw 'em in the ocean

Jack the fo' up two times

And young nigga, keep coastin'

Turn on the DVD and watch myself on TV

It's killings after killings but they don't know it's me

It's lil' G, now what you think that stand fo?

I'm gangsta on the streets and I keep it Crippin' in the studio

Who else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?

Gallop in yo shit like the black joust

To make it real simple and quick

If I don't have it, I gots to take yo shit

And it's all about the fast lane, nigga

When you see me on the streets, I got my finger on tha trigga

Never catch who's slippin' when I'm on them 2-wing deez

And when I get my bricks, I flood ya whole city in titties

Please believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker

Turned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas

[Kokane]

On a late night..

That's the time that we gone move a gang away

Late night

They call me Chef Boyardee, pushin' up some cakes

On a late night..

Deeper and deeper

I bang these streets for all so long

Late night

Deeper and deeper

Uh, wit this game that I got, I can't go wrong

[fades out]

// So Low //

[Lil' Mo (Kokane)]

Roll with me

Come smoke with me (Smoke with me)

Come close to me

So low (Come flow with me)

Dance with me

Take a chance with me (This is your chance)

Take a dip with me

Don't go

[Snoop Dogg]

Oh no, I have a party to attend

With some civilized people, and some more of my friends

I wish I could stick around

But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now

Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu

Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do

Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here

And I done already been there, so I don't really care

Now you can take that, take that

Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that

You can't do nothin about it

You know damn well what I got back at the house

And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes

Gimme the blues, hand my the booze

Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it

So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove

I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose

Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool

But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real

[Goldie Loc]

Yo, this the single house

We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch

Everybody get they groove on

I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on

Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips

Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13

Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean

Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up

Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up

Dog walk to the cat walk

I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk

There's somethin about the way you blow my mind

Got me wanna boogie all the time

Baby this is what I'm lovin

Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance

[Tray Deee]

Lil' momma got a gang of ass

Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast

Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance

Spark a conversation to ignite the flash

Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip

Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with

You can act like the mack don't effect your type

Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight

Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy

Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy

Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet

Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat

You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete

But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep

Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me

Girl cuz I'ma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be

[Kokane]

Come fuck with me

Drink with me

Smoke with me

Yeah, yeah

Loc with me

Drink some Hennesey

Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee

Yeah, yeah

[Snoop talking (Lil' Mo singing in background)]

Yeah you tryin to fuck with a nigga huh

I can't even trip though

It might seem like, some shit like, two-two

Beep-beep, haha, two-two

Beep-beep, two-two [Repeat until fade]
