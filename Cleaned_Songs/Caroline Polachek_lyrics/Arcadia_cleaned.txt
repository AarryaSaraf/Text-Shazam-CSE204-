Album: Arcadia

// Dominic //

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

// Arcadia //

Cars they were passing
Waves they were crashing on the shore
Fingers were burning the pages they're turning
And I want more
Here I ran from the west
Unto ruins where the sun dances with death

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now she holds me tight like I held you
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

To be had...

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now I know that time forgets us too
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

// Backwards And Upwards //

Love
What a mean
Poison arrow welcome to me
What a shot
When I
Bent over to tie shoe laces
Cut it out
At the seed
And the rip is a rotation
Drawing O
In the sky
With no answers in the jury

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Backwards and up, up, up up

Take the wheel

Oh, the driver is fine
But the passenger is carsick
Back it up
Turn around
Like a ferris wheel I shift it
"Oh, it burns
But it cleans"
Say the nurses in their tunics
"Just admit
You were wrong
It's the opposite of foolish"

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and up, up, up up

Backwards
Backwards
Uh huh, backwards, backwards
Words, words, words

// Getaway Ride //

Pass the screwdriver
(Cha cha cha)
Here's a key
To the courtyard
By the cemetery
(Cha cha cha)
When the world is watching
I'll take the easy way out
To wait until your signal
While you burn the place down

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
(what now)
Of this
(this is)
Desire
(Cha cha cha)
I'm a thief
(Blind thief)
In the schoolyard
(baby)
Or just wanting to be
(Cha cha cha)
Breaking single file
Tell me you want to escape
Down the road to nowhere
To watch my heart break

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what?
And so what?

Ride! We can make it
Oh, I've all but lost my mind
Take the rest of me
Take it all
You're my destiny
Ooh
Baby don't be ashamed

Ride...
Ride...

// Avenues //

Between the buoy of dreaming
And the anchor of home
I had you
Leaning into the beams
In the fading heat
I showed you yours, you showed me mine

All my avenues are green
No trembling or goodbye
But the shadows know I miss you
Dearly, dearly
So sincerely

Under buoys of dreams
Above an anchor home
I found you
And though you can't call me lover
I'm a star in your sky
Baby, I'm a loner by design

All my avenues are green
As heartache is unwise
Ashes scatter of what happened
Nearly, nearly
So sincerely

// Lady's Got Gills //

Why is your pretty friend wearing her collar high
Why does she turn away when you look at her in the eye?
It gives me the chills
It's like you to want the one
The one that you couldn't keep
Watch how she holds her breath
And leaves when you go to sleep

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

You'd give everything you have
If she'd just promise to come back
From her unexplained trips to the harbor
Where the tide runs black
There's no sense in trading places
To lock her up and keep her in the bath
Or learn how to hold her breath

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

Watching from the shore
No, you don't want to lose her
To the roar insatiable
Would you rather drown than say goodbye?

// Reprise //

Cold, unworthy, fickle heart
That's all too late in learning
That if I should love you till the last
I'll leave you be

// Izzit True What They Tell Me //

The second you offered me a ride
I couldn't get the thought out of my mind
Promises open when they're pried
Up with the vapor of a week of sighs
The cards say, "A change is coming near
And as a nestling on the bough
The fool is the martyr of the now"

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

Inviting you in a second time
How your possessions were lighter than mine
And how we talked all through the night
As if I'd have known you all of my life
Touching your finger to my eye
How you prove the card was right
That said you'd be all I have in sight

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

Ay, is the lesson cast asunder
Oh, and you can't even know
What kind of lack that you're leaving
Ay, want a rented bed of sorrow
Go to hell I adore you
Ay, ever-righteous call of thunder
Oh, I don't know what to call it
But I know that you feel it
Ay, ever-wretched call of wonder
With no regrets...
Now I receive you on the day
I hide and seek you on the hour
(In time)
In odysseys of no and yes
Even now, as a witness...
And even now...

Am I a finch, am I the cage
O either way I couldn't care
If you could see inside my head
Where every clock is stopped by you
Like in some silent threat
Like I'm the one that should be careful
Though it never could've happened without you
No it never could have happened without you...

Budding interrupted
In glory of their matching
Winding up the rope
Together and alone
Tell me a story
Leaving out the ending
I don't want to know
Whose heart was made to roam

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

// Wings Of The Parapets //

The wings of the parapets
Watch over the stage of joy and rage
They watch as I catch flight
And you fill the fuel to give me a ride

Here above the open ledge
With no control of which to speak
Oh, if love is a dependency
Resign me

Hear, a dove in the cargo bay
An-hundred miles beneath his feet
Oh, if love is the opposite of free
Resign me
