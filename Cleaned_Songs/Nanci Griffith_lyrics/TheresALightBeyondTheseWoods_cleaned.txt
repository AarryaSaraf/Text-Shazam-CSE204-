// I Remember Joe //

Oh, your golden lights of America
Joseph sought your prairies and your buffalo
And the humming of the rails down through
Kansas, they brought Joseph in from Baltimore
The Cavalry the Indians and an old dan were his only friends
Then the old dan died and the Indian's plight
Made the Cavalry young Joe's enemy

Oh, the outlaws spilled the blood across
The Kansas plains in the '70s
Joseph took a badge for America
To defend you from your fantasies
Joseph wore that badge across the Kansas prairies
To save the railroads
But the heroes that we made, well, they were
Ruthless soldiers who'll kill for gold

With a broken heart for the frontier plains
Joseph sat a-rocking in his front porch swing
That old tin badge is tarnished now
You know it was just a young man's dream
And old man's tales are hard to reach when you
Don't believe in your American dream
The Indians, the buffalo and old Joe Mason
They died from memory

Oh, your golden lights of America
Joseph sought your prairies and your buffalo
And the humming of the rails down through Kansas
They brought Joseph in from Baltimore
The Cavalry, the Indians and an old dan
Forsaken old man

Oh, your golden lights of America

// Alabama Soft Spoken Blues //

Southern man, you sure are pretty
Got a smile to still the city
And Lord, you know, you got those sleepy eyes
Alabama sweet-talking baby
Calmed the heart of a lonely lady
You kept me flying high
And the leaving easy
And it's Dallas in the rain
And I was dreaming

October winds still blowing, Lord
You know the song were flowing
From a broken-hearted lady by the wayside
Listen to my song
You kept it ringing clean and strong
You held me like an angel to confide in
And I tried to make you home
But I was dreaming

Lord, I guess you just ain't home
That damned old telephone
Is trying hard to help me find the lines here
Wish that you could understand
Why I love the other man
He gives me truth and reason
I believe in

Alabama soft-spoken blues again
Alabama soft-spoken blues again
Early morning fog is rolling in
Time for leaving

Alabama soft-spoken blues

// Michael's Song //

There's a light out on the freeway, says it's time to go
I'm wasting my time counting stains on a barroom floor
Thinking 'bout my hometown and the friends I'll leave behind
Mostly 'bout the man who writes his songs with smiling rhymes
And I'm holding on to a smokey view of his dreams in the midnight light

Michael counts his songs in the years of wasted miles
I used to think he was really part of that fantasy in rhyme
But looking back on all his tunes of butterflies and sunshine
There was only one about the man he kept inside
About the time he crossed the line and let a tear come to his eye

I used to hide out in his pretty smile
And hope it would shine me through the morrow
Until I learned the way it feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile without a soul to share his sorrow

The light here at the freeway, well, it's turning green to gold
The stains on that barroom floor ten miles back down the road
Thinking 'bout how that old bar brought Michael back to mind
And how I can sing his blues and be smiling here inside
I guess a weary soul will always sing Michael's smiling rhymes

I used to hide out in his pretty smile
And hope it would shine me through the morrow
Until I learned the way it feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile without a soul to share his sorrow

// Song For Remembered Heroes //

Well, it's that old time story of a new face to glory
Someone wanted my soul for their pride
What about the system of fools arranged for missing
Well, I can't lie, they all pass with time

Why do my people come and go?
I keep on leaving them behind, and Lord I miss them so
I've watched my heroes change from silver into gold
As the time goes, only memories grow

It's your smile that I remember, the dreams of the young and tender
Coming real, but now it seems
That highways are for foolish travelers, always bonded, always shackled
By the prayer that they're remembered in our dreams

I am just a barroom child, tried so damn hard to learn the style
Of your drunken tears, the way they smile
I guess I'll never learn the rules, I still play the simple fool
Who loves without the chains of lies

As the time goes, only memories grow

// West Texas Sun //

Wash away the tears, all the angry times we shared
All the feelings and the sorrows come and gone
We have left them slip away, because I'm standing here today
And I'm smiling at your old west Texas sun

I remember times when you'd weathered out my mind
But you always had a peaceful word to say
And you could bring always bring a smile with the mischief in your eyes
Still, I'm glad the miles kept me separate from your games

You know you're still as wild as those old Texas plains
Standing by the highway, do you still call my name?
Lord, I can't believe it's been such a long, long time
Since I've seen that Texas boy smile

Well, I'll be heading out of town, I may stop by next time around
Hell, it's raining, but at least that's something real
I came shackled down with fears about our dreams and wasted years
And now I know exactly how to feel

Wash away the tears, all the angry times we shared
All the feelings and the sorrows come and gone
We have let them slip away, because I'm standing here today
Smiling at your old west Texas sun

// Dollar Matinee //

Ronnie stood beneath the movie marquee
His memories all curled up inside
He was trying to remember
Was it August or September
He'd seen her for the last time

He'd heard that she'd become an actress
Lord, she always had the prettiest face
And he stood with his hands
In his pockets and waited
For the dollar matinee

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

The theater, she smelled so familiar
She was a smokey old velvet delight
Yes, and he sat down front
Just like he'd always done
With his feet hanging out in the aisles

And he watched her with eyes disbelieving
Felt something like time on his brain
And he told himself
Don't you remember it's only
Just a part that she's playing

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

She stood by some window in Paris
While the captions translated the scene
Oh, and Ronnie stared back
At her body and breathed
"Christ, that's the first time I've seen it!"

Behind him the people were leaving
Well, the busses, they were humming outside
But old Ronnie never went
To the movies unless
He could stay and see it twice

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

// Montana Backroads //

In an old pickup truck, with his hat pulled down
He drives them old Montana backroads
Remembering half-forgotten times, and wondering where it's gone
And if he can still carry the load

Now, the summer sun is setting, and the moon is on the rise
As he pulls that old pickup into town
And he parks beside the place where the feed store used to be
And he heads for an old familiar sound

Those honky-tonk bands still play old-time songs
Remembering how things used to be
Sitting at the bar with his head down in his hands
So alone with his memories
Lord, he's so alone with his memories

He remembers back in '33, or was it '34
The year that he won the rodeo
The buckle that they gave him, well, he still wears today
For that Brahma bull that he rode

But his riding days are over now, his back is getting weak
And his eyesight, it just ain't as good
As the days he'd spot a deer at a hundred yards or more
And bring back a month's supply of food

Those honky-tonk bands still play old-time songs
Remembering how things used to be
Sitting at the bar with his head down in his hands
So alone with his memories
Lord, he's so alone with his memories

Now the bar is getting set to close, they say he's got to leave
But it feels like, Lord, he just arrived
So he downs his last shot as he's heading for the door
Getting ready for that long and lonely drive

In an old pickup truck, with his hat pulled down
He drives them old Montana backroads
Remembering half-forgotten times, and wondering where it's gone
And if he can still carry the load

Those honky-tonk bands still play old-time songs
Remembering how things used to be
And he tumbles through the door, and he falls down on his bed
Still alone with his memories
Lord, he's still alone with his memories

// John Philip Griffith //

He was a simple man only to a stranger
And the kindness in his eyes
I still remember
Now that he is old
They say he's angry and he's cold
That his soul is dying

He's a wealthy man's dream
And he's a working man's dime
He has stood in both men's shoes
In his own damn time
The hard times of the thirties
Still linger in his mind
When he is lonely
He's out there in the cold
Twenty years away from home
Does he dream about his old home
In San Antone?
He's often watched the highways
But he's a man of sixty-five
Where ain't a soul in El Paso
Who would give an old drunk a ride

Now, he traded in his draftsman's pen
For a fishing pole
And his mansion on the hill
Is an alley in El Paso
The anchors of the fifties
Still hold to broken dreams
When his sorrows grow

He's out there in the cold
Twenty years away from home
Does he dream about his old home
In San Antone?
He's often watched the highways
But he's a man of sixty-five
There ain't a soul in El Paso
Who would give an old drunk a ride

Now, they tell me that John Philip
Loved to gamble in his day
And he burned his bridges well
When he walked away
He closed those corporate doors
Left his children and his home
Now no one owns him
