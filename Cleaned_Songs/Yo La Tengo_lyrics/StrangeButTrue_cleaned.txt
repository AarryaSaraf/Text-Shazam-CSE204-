A man taught his little monkey
How to help out with the chores
Together they sanded the woodwork
And painted all the windows and doors

They stained athe wood in the bedroom
And laid new tile in the hall
Then the monkey tried, all by himself,
To put paper on the wall

There was nobody home to help him
So he thought up his own little trick
He wasn't sure what he was doing
Or how to make the wallpaper stick

Instead of using paste
He stuck it up with monkey spit
Now the house smells like bananas
Wherever paper is hung in it
