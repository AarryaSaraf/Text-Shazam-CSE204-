// Pocket Calculator //

I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator

I am adding 
And subtracting
I'm controlling 
And composing

I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator

I am adding 
And subtracting
I'm controlling 
And composing

By pressing down a special key
It plays a little melody
By pressing down a special key
It plays a little melody

I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator 
With my pocket calculator

// Computer Love //

Computer love
Computer love

Another lonely night
Stare at the TV screen
I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous
Computer love
Computer love

I call this number
For a data date
I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous

Computer love
Computer love

// Home Computer //

I program my home computer
Beam myself into the future
