// Funtimes In Babylon //

Fun times in Babylon
That's what I'm counting on
Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
Before the new wing of the prison ribbon ceremony
Before the star of the morning comes looking for me

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out Hollywood, here I come

Fun times in Babylon
Mama they've just begun
Before they put me to work in a government camp
Before they do my face up like a corpse and say "get up and dance"
Before the beast comes looking for last year's rent

I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around my wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come
Look out Hollywood, here I come

// Nancy From Now On //

Oh, pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
Where my organs scream, "Slow down, man!"

How was I to know?
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Oh, hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon
I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes

How was I to know?
Milk and honey flow
Just a couple states below

Ooh, give me how it was
A place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
Run boy, run boy

// Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings //

Jesus Christ, girl
What are people gonna think?
When I show up to one of several funerals
I've attended for Grandpa this week

With you
With me
But someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig

Jesus Christ, girl
It hasn't been long so it seems
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
At the Hollywood Cemetery

You kiss
On me
But we should let this dead guy sleep
We should let this dead guy sleep

Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins

You came
I think?
'Cause the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things

But someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig
Someone's gotta help me dig

// I'm Writing A Novel //

I ran down the road
Pants down to my knees
Screaming, "Please come help me
That Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!"

And I'm writing a novel
'Cause it's never been done before

First house that I saw
I wrote, "House" up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out
"'Cause my reality is realer than yours"

And there's no time in the present
And there's a black dog on the bed

I went to the backyard
To burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said
"You can't turn nothing into nothingness with me no more"

Well I'm no doctor
But that monkey might be right
And if he is
I'll be walking him my whole life

I rode to Malibu
On a dune buggy with Neil
He said, "You're gonna have to drown me down on the beach
If you ever want to write 'the real'."

And I said "I'm sorry.
Young man what is your name again?"

Now everywhere I go
In West Hollywood
It's filled with people pretending they don't see the actress
And the actress wishing that they could

We could do ayahuasca
Baby, if I wasn't holding all these drinks

Something 'bout the way
Violet whips her hair
That makes me empty my pockets on the corner to corner
Bumming twenties as if I was the mayor

I don't need any new friends, Mama
But I could really use something to do
So if you're up for it sometimes
I swear you wouldn't have to be my muse

Heidegger and Sartre
Drinking poppy tea
I could've sworn last night I passed out in my van
And now these guys are pouring one for me

I'll never leave the canyon
'Cause I'm surrounded on all sides
By people writing novels
And living on amusement rides

// O I Long To Feel Your Arms Around Me //

Everyone's riding on the rolling tide
Their hearts are heavy and the sea is wide
I'll never make it to the other side
Friends of mine

O I long to feel your arms around me
O I long to feel your arms around me

O my love
O my love
Ooh
Ooh

// Misty's Nightmares 1 & 2 //

No crickets, no creatures are a stirring
On the last night of the Chinese year
I need a warm hand over the water
Ever since I lost mine in the fireworks disaster

Now I lay up wide awake
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day

Now I'm watching you changing the mirror
And I'm unable to move
When all my girlfriends appear in the doorway
I don't know how they got here
I don't know what to say about this

And they all go that way
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day

// Only Son Of The Ladiesman //

When I heard the ladiesman was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin

Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time if I'd been acting
When I sang "Moon River" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called action

I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodger's fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one night stand
I'm a ladiesman

Only son of a ladiesman
Only son of a ladiesman

Couldn't see his used-up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with the garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress

Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
Cowboy and the cop shot down the ladiesman
The humid nights in L.A. are now silent
I swear that man was womankind's first husband

Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman

// This Is Sally Hatchet //

Born the daughter of a comedian
Middle of the 80s
Someone turn that awful mouth-breathing down
Or else

Sally Hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
The longer it keeps raining, the more she has to struggle
To maintain a wonderful time
Oh yeah

Oh wanna love it up without me
I've got smoke in my lungs
And a past life in the trunk
Oh

Could he rattle by the way that she
Empties a few clips out
Do I have a choice now?
Point that thing away from me
Lady, oh

// Well, You Can Do It Without Me //

If you see a flaming sword in your dreams at night
And feel inspired to assign me up to the front line
Well give the order
You'll storm the border without me

If they tell you you're a genius but you need some proof
Ask anybody on the payroll to go out with you
If they avoid ya
Then they'll award ya definitely

Nobody that's around just seems to get it right
How hard is it to follow just a few guidelines
And smile while you do it

If you want a page written 'bout you in the book
But you need a food tester 'cause you cursed the cook
I'll take some wine
But you can dine without me

Without me
Who would let you play God
And make-believe that all the blasphemy 
Is coming only from me?

If you're bound for the throne but the king won't die
I can occupy the queen but that's for her and I
I can do her
And you'll be ruler without me 

Yeah, you can do it
But you can do it without me

// Now I'm Learning To Love The War //

Oh, oh

Try not to think so much about
The truly staggering amount
Of oil that it takes to make a record
All the shipping, the vinyl
The cellophane lining, the high gloss
The tape and the gear

Try not to become too consumed
With what's a criminal volume
Of oil that it takes to paint a portrait
The acrylic, the varnish
Aluminum tubes filled with latex
The solvents and dye, oh

Let's just call this what it is
The jealous side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose

Try not to dwell so much upon
How it won't be so very long
From now that they laugh at us for selling
A bunch of fifteen year olds made from dinosaur bones singing, "Oh yeah"
Again and again
Right up to the end

Let's just call this what it is
The jealous side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose, oh

I'll just call this what it is
My vanity gone wild with my crisis
One day this all will repeat
I sure hope they make something useful out of me

// Tee Pees 1-12 //

Well you took me to the movies
You took me to the dance
You took me to your warehouse
Tied up in the back of your van
You said, "Whip it out." and I started to shout
"I'm in love with the woman again!"

Well you took me to your office
We went to meet your folks
We went out to the garden shed
Where I took off all my clothes
And I was terrified by the look in your eyes
But there's a lot to loving I don't know

Well you took me to the ceremony
To sweat out all my fear
You came across the cosmic serpent
With pants rolling into his hair
If he's my spirit guide, I'm gonna stay inside 
I'm never sleeping in a teepee again

No no
No no no no no
Doo doo doo doo

Well you asked me where I came from
In the middle of round ten
I thanked you for the compliment
Before you clarified what you meant
You said, "What the hell are you doing here?
There's a crawler in my apartment."

Trout fishing in America
Baby go and buy a pole
But by the time I got around to reading the book
I was a celebrated deep sea pro
Was drinking Greyhounds way below the ground
On my very own TV show

Well we went to get some work done
So our faces finally matched
The doctor took one look at me
And took a skin graft out of my ass
If this is what it takes to take you one date
I'm gonna put my mammoth behind glass
If I make it out alive from Hollywood and Vine
I'll build a cabin up in the Northwest

No no
No no no no no
Doo doo doo doo

// Everyman Needs A Companion //

Everyman needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

Oh, oh

John the Baptist took Jesus Christ
Down to the river on a Friday night
They talked about Mary like a couple of boys
With nothing to lose, too scared to try

Everyman needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you, oh

Oh, oh

Joseph Campbell and The Rolling Stones
Couldn't give me a myth, so I had to write my own
Like I'm hung up on religion, though I know it's a waste
I never liked the name Joshua, I got tired of J

Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
