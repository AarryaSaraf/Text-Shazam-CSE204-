// Dream Baby //

Sweet dream baby, 
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream.

Dream baby, got me dreamin'
Aweet dreams the whole day through.
Dream baby got me dreamin'
Sweet dreams in nighttime too.

I love you and I'm dreamin' of you
That won't do
Dream baby, help me stop my dreamin' of you
And make my dreams come true.

Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream...

// Down Came The World //

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world.

She must have loved a little
Just to keep me hanging on
How could lips that kiss so sweet
Lie and be so wrong?

Our love was just a pattern
Of the perfect boy and girl
The only dream I own
In this world.

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world.

[Instrumental]

I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world
Down, down, down came the world...

// You Beat All I Ever Saw //

I've walked through many towns
With fortunes lost and found
Seen the beauty of this land
Made by nature and by men.

But when I leave I don't look back
For I've only left my tracks
I've crossed the burning bridges
And walked through miles of sand.

Seen the lowliest in the law
You beat all I ever saw.

[Instrumental]

I've dreamed a million miles
About your eyes and smiles
I know I've loved the best
I can't be content with last.

I've scanned the skies of blue
For just one glimpse of you
But they threw away the mold
Of a love that's grown so cold.

Your heart would never thaw
You beat all I ever saw...

// She Loves Me (She Don't Love You) //

Well, now I can see
You're dancin' every dance with her
And it seems to me
You're dancin' much too close to her.

When you sat at our table
You sat next to her
But I know that it's true
She loves me, she don't love you.

Well, let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even tellin' me that I'm the guy for her
And if a little thing you do and say
Has given you away you're in love with her.

Well, just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
Oh, what it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me.

Here's your coat there's the door
I think you better leave
'Cause I just know that it's true
She loves me, she don't love you.

[Instrumental]

Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even tellin' me that I'm the guy for her
And if a little thing you do and say
Has given you away you're in love with her...

// Born To Love You //

Born to love only you
Destined to die alone without you
Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you.

Night after night wanting for you
Living a life built around you
Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you.

[Instrumental]

Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you...

// The Dark Side Of Fame //

Just a kid with a song when he wandered from home
In search of the phantom of fame
She promised she'd wait but he got back too late
Just a scene from the dark side of fame.

In the wrong frame of mind he took to the wine
Holding pieces of love's broken chain
It was colder than jade in this world that he'd made
All alone on the dark side of fame.

His songs were soon curled on the lips of the world
They earned him the highest of claim
And yet his greatest desire was the simple warmth of love's fire
'Cause it's cold on the dark side of fame.

The wine took its toll and soon he grew old
Much younger than most people do
But there's no trace of shame in the sound of his name
Though he lived on the dark side of fame.

He lived on the dark side of fame...

// John's Back In Town //

John does some singin' they call him a star
He plays with a hillbilly band
He goes lots of places picks his guitar
Old John ain't a home lovin' man.

John's got a woman he calls her his queen
He buys her them city made clothes
And she's 'bout the sweetest that I've ever seen
There is someting that John never knows.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be se
You'll know that John's back in town.

[Instrumental]

When John's out a tourin' I wear his best suits
Smoke up his old big cigars
I lie with his woman, wear out his boots
Shauffer his limousine cars.

When John's making money he keeps on the go
So if you should hear he's around
Buy one of his records or go see his show
Help me keep old John out of town.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be seen
You can figure that John's back in town...

// Listen, They're Playing My Song //

Down the street a baby just cried
When he woke up all alone
A train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound
Is chilling me right to the bone.

A song is playing I can barely hear
About a love that's gone wrong
The freezing rain on my window pane
Listen they're playing my song.

Taps being played by a soldier's grave
So sad it torments your soul
Just listen to that north wind moan
Tonight it's so dark and cold.

Somewhere a siren cuts through the night
Sounds like a whole world's gone wrong
Thunder just warned but it's coming a storm
Listen they're playing my song...
