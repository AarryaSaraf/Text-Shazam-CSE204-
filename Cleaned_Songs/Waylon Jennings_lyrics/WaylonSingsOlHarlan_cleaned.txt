// She Called Me Baby //

She called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I woke and she was gone
There's no more baby, baby all night long.

She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby, baby all night long.

[Instrumental]

She called me baby, baby all night long
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each time in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby, baby all night long.

I still hear baby, baby all night long...

// Sunset And Wine //

I left the old farm down in Texas
And bummed all around for a time
Then one day I found myself staring
At a sign that read Sunset and Wine.

The big cars and the beautiful women
Put beautiful thoughts in my mind
I decided to be a great actor
On the corner of Sunset and Wine.

Then a man with a cigar approached me
And he put his face right to mine
And declared a great star hit this cover
On the corner of Sunset and Wine.

[Instrumental]

Well, I thought he was right for a while
For the band seemed to thrill with each line
And they put my name in the sidewalk
Near the corner of Sunset and Wine.

Now six wives and six divorces later
I'm down to one very thin dime
And I wish I was back home in Texas
And I'd never seen Sunset and Wine.

[Instrumental]

I wish I'd never seen Sunset and Wine...

// Woman Let Me Sing You A Song //

Woman let me sing you a song
Woman let me sing you a song
That tells how you've done me wrong
So it's your fault if it's long.
Woman let me sing you a song.

Well, the neighbors all say I run around
Yeah. the neighbors all say I run around
But baby if I do I'm still miles in back off you
Woman let me sing you a song.

[Instrumental]

You tell our friends I drink too much
Now the whole town knows I drink too much
But the reason why I drink
Is a thought you make to think
Woman let me sing you a song.

Woman let me sing you a song
Woman let me sing you a song
I said I'd die for you
And I have the time or two
Woman let me sing you a song.

Now, woman I've done sang you my song...

// Everglades //

He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man 'bout the kind to kill
But the jealous fight and the flashing blades
Sent him on the run through the everglades.
Running like the dog through the everglades.

Where a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville.

[Instrumental]

Well, the posse went in and they came back out
And said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye the debt is paid
It won't last long in the everglades
A man can't live in the everglades.

But a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville.

[Instrumental]

Now the years went by and his girl was wed
His family gave up they thought he was dead
Now and then the people would say
They had seen him runnin' through the everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the everglades.

Where a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville...

// She's Gone, Gone, Gone //

She said if I ever deceived her
She'd be gone before I could count ten
Well, I guess that I didn't believe her
'Cause look at the trouble that I'm in.

And now he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Cryin' won't bring her back
The more that I cry the faster the train
Flies farther on down the track.

[Instrumental]

If I only knew where to find her
I'd crawl there on my hands and knees
But each tick of the clock is a reminder
She's one second farther from me.

And now he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Cryin' won't bring her back
The more that I cry the faster the train
Flies farther on down the track...

// Busted //

My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes. but I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound. and I'm busted
I got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills gettin' bigger each day.
The county will haul my belongings away, 'cause I'm busted

I went to see my brother, gonna ask him for a loan, I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, but I'm busted
My brother said there ain't one thing I can do
Wife and the kids they're all down with the flu
I was just thinking about calling on you, 'cause I'm busted.

[Instrumental]

I ain't no thief but a man can go wrong, when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone, and I'm busted
Well, the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow
Me and my family gotta pack up and go
I'll make a living but where I don't know, I'm just busted...

// Beautiful Anabel Lee //

I was a child and she was a child
Yet our love was something to see
My parents were poor I was turned from the door
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee.

Now the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the soft eyes
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee.

[Instrumental]

But not even the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can't keep me away from my meeting someday
With my beautiful Anabel Lee.

And the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the soft eyes
Of my beautiful Anabel Lee.

My beautiful Anabel Lee...

// Heartaches By The Number //

Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay.

I've got heartaches by the numbers, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the numbers, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end.

[Instrumental]

Heartache number three was when you called me
You said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on my door
I waited but you must have lost your way.

I've got heartaches by the numbers, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the numbers, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end...

// I've Got A Tiger By The Tail //

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

Well, every night you drag me where the bright lights're found
There ain't no way to slowin' you down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

[Instrumental]

I thought the day I met you you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
Now the pace we've been living takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail...

// Heartaches For A Dime //

I called you on the phone to say I love you
That I'd stop by for you at nine
My heart broke when you said that it's all over
Someone else would take up all your time.

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime.

[Instrumental]

I went downtown to join the merry makers
I told myself that here's where I belong
I thought that I was doin' fine without you
And then I heard somebody play our song.

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime.

That's a lot of heartaches for a dime...

// Foolin' Around //

I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

I wasn't foolin' round the day I said I'd do
Many a night I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
When it's you a fool I'll always be.

I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

[Instrumental]

Honey, fool around you'll know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome 'cause I'm used to that
When you're tired of foolin' round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me...

// In This Very Same Room //

That's the very same door that I carried her through
On the night we were married last June
And right overthere is the very same chair
That she sat in when she said we're through.

Overhere you can see where I got on my knees
And I begged but her heart was a stone
Overhere's where I cried did you know I'd died
Right here in this very same room.

[Instrumental]

To your right there's a crib and it's never been used
Perhaps that's why we're apart
And there sits a phone that she used on alone
To make plans with her new sweetheart.

Then she walked overhere and she picked up her things
Then left me alone in the gloom
Overhere's where I cried did you know I'd died
Right here in this very same room.

Right here in this very same room...
