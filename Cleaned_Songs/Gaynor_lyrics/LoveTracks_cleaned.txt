// Stoplight //

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

Just gettin' over a hit and run
And let me tell ya, it ain't no fun
I couldn't give you the right of way
Till I believe every word you say

I took a ride for too much lyin'
Spun my wheels and left me cryin'
So understand, it's love I'm heedin'

I've had my fill of speedin'
It's a case of live and learn
Read all signs before you turn
Love came in and left so fast
It shook me up
A classic case of whiplash

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

You've so good lookin' you drive me wild
But I've been over some rugged miles
I'd like to go where you have in mind
But I'd be crossin' the yellow line

And so I'll pass with just a kiss
Conditions say no more than this
The lane of love, it's fast and wicked
What's really cold, it gets no ticket

I've had my fill of speedin'
It's a case of live and learn
Read all signs before you turn
Love came in and left so fast
It shook me up
A classic case of whiplash

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

And if your love is really true
I'll give my everything to you
Till then I'm flashin' you a

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean
[repeat last verse and fade]

// Anybody Wanna Party? //

Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party

Love, sweet love won't you be good to me? 
You could set me free
Come on, set me free
We could dance 'neath the pale moonlight
Feeling good tonight
Feeling good tonight

Please somebody's got to get me to the action
Some satisfaction is what I've been searching for
Got to find myself a happy situation
Some celebration
Somebody who calls for more

Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?

Hey hey
Get down

It'd be nice to realize a little romance
I could dig some slow dance
I could dig some girl-meets-boy
Can't put too much time in searching for some reason
Must be the season
For doin' that jump for joy

Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?

Love sweet love won't you be good to me? 
You could set me free
Come on, set me free
We could dance 'neath the pale moonlight
Feeling good tonight
Feeling good tonight

I'm a person with a passion for some livin'
Can't help givin' my body a real good time
I'm a sucker for the music and the laughter
I know right after
That lovin' is soon sublime

Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?

Hey hey
Get down (Anybody)
Get down get down (wanna party)
Get down get down
Get down (Anybody wanna party)
Get down get down 
Get down get down
Get down

Anybody wanna party down tonight? (Anybody)
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?

Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party

// Goin' Out Of My Head //

Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Over you
Over you
I want you to want me
I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you
And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'Cause I can't explain the tears that I shed
Over you
Over you
I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right

I must think of a way
Into your heart
There's no reason why
My being shy
Should keep us apart
Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right

Night and day and night
Wrong or right
Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right

// You Can Exit //

You've been giving indications that you're leaving
And I'd wish that you'd admit it right away
Help me understand the pattern you've been weaving
Is it only out of habit that you stay

Lay it on the line hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
You can exit anytime
You can exit anytime

I can feel the good going in your kissing
I can see the sign of cheating in your eyes
Could it be another girl you might be missing?
Do I have to try to see through some disguise?

Lay it on the line, hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
You can exit anytime
You can exit anytime

When we met we thought we'd write love's perfect story
And then we'd dream we'd be together until the end
If you want we can revive that flame and glory
Is this really love or just pretend

Lay it on the line, hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
Ha - you can exit anytime
Ha - you can exit anytime

Honey there's just no reason to keep playing this cruel heart breaking game
If you feel like moving on just say something, you know I just might feel the same
I know your find, but so am I
If you don't like the signs
If you don't like the feel
You can exit anytime

// I Said Yes //

Wowow, hahahaha, yeheyehe

He was bad, he was clean
Dressed to kill that is wrapped on me
I can't kill
Coz that's all I understand
Wowow

You were gone, left me blue
We both know how long we've been through
What Am I
Convenient love for you
Wow

Yes, no
It hurts me so
Heart is weak
But mind is go
Do your dance
What is life without sweet romance

I took a chance and I said yes
At time when I needed love
I open my heart, let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet
True happiness
So I confess
I said yes

Must confess
He'd say yes
I said Y-E-S
Wowow

With my heels
Have some fun
Dance and dance
Till the morning sun
You're so good
When love goes like it should

Watch me by
Dance that high
Far away from the tears
I've cried
Tears that cruel
We live in an awful groove
I made a move

I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet
True happiness
And so I confess
I said yes

He'd say yes (He'd say yes)
I said yes
Oh, I said Y-E-S
I took a chance
And I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Oh oh I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one
I said yes

// Substitute //

Say
You've been waiting much too long now
Don't know when she's coming home
Say now
You've been loyal true and faithful 
All this time of being alone
If I could get that same dedication 
I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back (come back) (come back)
Ooh! I'll be your substitute whenever you want me
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
(Send my love and admiration straight to you)

Say (Say)
Everyday you waited for her, I've been waiting here for you
Say (Say)
All this time I've been lonely knowing what you're going through
I waited 'til my chances occured, 'cause you can't keep relying on her
If she doesn't come back (if she doesn't come back)
I'll be your substitute whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Each day by your window (you sit and sigh) hoping to see her face
Well you might as well forget about her and find someone to take her 
Place
I'll be your substitute whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
I'll be your substitute whenever you leave her, 
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
