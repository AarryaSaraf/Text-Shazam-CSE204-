// How Long (Betcha' Got A Chick On The Side) //

Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side

I know you want us both and I know the reason why (I know why you want her)
I can give you so much lovin', but presents she can buy ya (how much can money buy)
Last night you're in my arms, but tonight I'm all alone
How long (how long) will this game go on, How long (how long) Oh oh how long?

Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side

It's plain, plain enough to see that you're not happy with me
I can't keep playing gamest o keep my heart straight
I want to turn to walk away but it's harder to do than it is to say
How long (how long) will this game go on, How long (how long) Oh oh how long?

Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (I bet you got another, yeah you got another lover)
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (I caught you, I caught you with her twice)
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (can she love you? Can she love you like me?)
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (can she love you? Can she set you free)
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (iYou got another lover, you got another lover)
Betcha got a chick on the side
Show you another trick, I know you got a chick on the side (I know you got another, another chick on the side)

It might hurt me for a while
But one thing I am sure
I'll get over you, yes I'll find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart
How long
Will this game go on
How long
Oh oh how long

// Sleeping Alone //

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
Tossin', turnin', cryin' from sleeping alone
Sleeping alone

(He went away)
Without a sound
(He went away)
Without a sound
I'm all alone

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
No one near me hears me by my pillow
By my pillow

He went away without a sound
He went away and left me here without a sound
All alone

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
Tired of sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone

(He went away)
Ah, you had to go, but I'm thankful for the beautiful times we had
(He went away)
Take my love as a friend, and when we meet again, it will sure make my heart feel glad
(He went away)
I'll never forget the night we kissed for the first time
(He went away)
Even though you must, you'll never go away from my mind

I have the blues

// Easy Days //

Easy days, when we can just relax
Easy days, that's when love can make you feel
That life is for real
We're just dreamin' and hopin' that someday soon

We'll have those easy days when we can lay around
And let the children play
And let choirs of angel sing our love to the world

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

When the sky's blue above and you're happy
Dreamin' of who you love but you only
Make believe he is near
There so much for you to see, do and go here
So relax your mind I'm sure you'll find

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

Easy days, sitting there all alone
Easy days, no one rings a telephone
They think you're not home
And you're glad that they could not get through it
And give you just one maybe two of those easy days

// Wanting Things //

Tell me how long must I keep
Wanting things,
Needing things, when I have so much.
There are many men who have much less than me,
Day by day they make their way.
And they find more in life thank I can see.
Tell me,

When will I learn to resist
Wanting things,
Touching things that say "do not touch."
Peo-ple that I meet seem to think I am strong,
They don't see inside of me.
So they don't know I'm weak and often wrong.
Tell me,
Why must I keep wanting things,
Needing things that just can't be mine!
(Yes, wanting things,
That just can't...
Be...
Mine...)

// Going Down Slowly //

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Don't get in too deep, brother
Don't get in too heavy
Don't fix, so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, John see
But he sees just a little too late
Losing his freedom and losing his soul
Now all he can do is just wait for the others

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down, yeah

Don't you get in too deep, sister
Don't get in too heavy
Don't you fix it so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, Mary see
Bu you see just a little too late
Had her history rectified
Now, all she can do is just wait for it to happen

Going down slowly
Slowly going down
Holy moly slowly going down

Don't get in too deep, brother
Don't get in too heavy
Don't fix, so you can't move about
Whenever you get ready

Born free, John see
But he sees just a little too late
Losing his freedom and losing his soul
Now, all he can do is just wait for the others

Going down slowly
