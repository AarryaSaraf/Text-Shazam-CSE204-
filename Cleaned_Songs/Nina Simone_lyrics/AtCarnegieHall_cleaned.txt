// Black Swan //

The sun is falling and it lies in blood
The moon is weaving bandages of gold
Old black swan where oh where is my lover now
Where oh where is my lover now

Torn and tattered is my bridal gown and my lamp is lost
With silver needles and with silver threads
The stars stitch a route for the dying sun
Old black swan where oh where is my lover now

I had given him a kiss and a golden ring
And a golden ring
I had given him a kiss of fire and a golden ring
Oh with silver needles and with silver threads
The stars stitch a route for the dying sun

Black wing o black wing take me down with you
Take me down with you take me down with you
Take me down with you
Old black swan take me down with you
I had given him a kiss of fire
Take me down with you

// Will I Find My Love Today //

The rain has stopped
The streets are fresh and warm
The sky is clear
The day begins to form
Once more I step outside
And in my quiet way
Once again these words I have to say

Will I find my love today
Will I see his smiling face
In some quiet, romantic place
Will he come my way

Will I find my love today
How I wonder how we'll meet
In the park or on the street
Will he come my way...

How am I to find love
What am I to do
I'm a lonely girl
With no rendevous

Will I find my love today
Will I see his smiling face
In some quiet, romantic place
Will he come my way

How am I to find love
Tell me, what am I to do
I'm a lonesome girl
With no rendevous

Will I find my love today
How I wonder how we'll meet
In the park or on the street

Or if I don't
I know tommorow
I will say
Will I find my love today

// The Other Woman-Cotton Eyed Joe //

The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone

Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

If it hadn't a-been for Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Oh where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
My Cotton Eyed Joe

Tell me where do you come from and where do you go
Tell me where do you come from my Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

Oh Joe if you hadn't been so slow
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from where do you go
I come for to see you and I come for to sing
And I come for to show you my diamond ring

Well if it hadn't a-been for Cotton Eyed Joe
Well I'd a-been married a long time ago
Oh where do you come from where do you go
My my Cotton Eyed Joe
