// The Twelfth Of Never //

You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like april snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost it's perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets

Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time

Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like april snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost it's perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
A long, long time

// Silver City Bound //

Yeah...
This is a song... was sung by leadbelly and it was written for...his friend...
He had a friend named blind lemon...
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to texas...
And I learned this tune from a record
I heard by him

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down
Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promises land
Take me by the hand oh babe

And lead me to the promised land

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promises land
Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promised land

I'm silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

// When I Was A Young Girl //

When I was a young girl I used to see pleasure
When I was a young girl I used to drink ale
Right out of the ale house and into the jail house
Right out of the bar room and down to my grave

Come mama come papa sit you beside me
Come mama come papa and pity my case
My poor heart is aching my heart it is breaking
My body salve-aided and I'm bound to die

Go send for the preacher to come and pray for me
Go send for the doctor to heal up my
My poor heart is aching my heart it is breaking
My body salve-aided and hell is my home

I want three young ladies to bear up my coffin
I want three young ladies to take me along
I want them to carry a bunch of wild roses
To put on my body as I pass along

One morning one morning in May
One morning one morning in May
I spy this young lady all clad in white linnen
All clad in white linnen cold as a clay

When I was a young girl I used to see pleasure
When I was a young girl I used to drink ale
Right out of the bar room
Right out of the ale house and into the jail house
Right out of the bar room down to my grave

// Lass Of The Low Country //

Oh she was a lass from the low country
And he was a lord of high degree
But she loved him oh so tenderly
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god

One day when the snow was on the mead
She passed him by on a milk white steed

And she spoke to him low nobody paid no need
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god

Now if you be a lass from the low country
Don't love no man of high degree
For he don't got a heart or no sympathy
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god

// The Young Knight //

Down deary down
There was a knight and he was young a-riding along the way Sir
And there he met a lady fair among the stacks of hay Sir
Down deary down

Quote he shall you and I, Lady among the grass lay down oh
And I will take a special care of the rumpling of your gown oh
So she told him
If you will go along with me into my father's hall Sir
You shall enjoy my maiden's head and my estate and all Sir
Down deary down

So he mounted her on a milk white steed himself upon another
And then they rid upon the road like sister and like brother
Down deary down down deary down
And when they came to father's home all moulded all about Sir
She stepped straight within the gate and shut the young man out Sir
Down deary down

Here is a pursue of gold she said take it for your pain Sir
And I will send my father's men to go home with you again Sir
And if you meet a lady fair as you go by the town Sir
You must not fear the dewy grass or
The rumpling grass of her gown Sir
Down deary down down deary down

And if you meet a lady gay as you go by the hill Sir
Here is the moral of the story
If you will not when you may you shall not when you will Sir

// You Can Sing A Rainbow //

This next song is a combination of
Two songs and they are both children's songs
And they are all about
The beauty of children and it can't be said too much in words
Our children are so very beautiful
They lack all our sophistication and all
Of our fear until they just plain beautiful

Murphy limo
Sweet-est little fellow
Everybody knows
Don't know what to call him
But he is mighty like a rose
Looking at his Mammy
Rise so shiny blue
Til it seems like heaven
Is climbing close to you

// Hush, Little Baby //

Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

And if that mockingbird don't sing,
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

And if that diamond ring turn brass,
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.

And if that looking glass gets broke,
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.

And if that billy goat don't pull,
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.

And if that cart and bull turn over,
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

And if that dog named Rover won't bark.
Papa's gonna to buy you and horse and cart.

And if that horse and cart fall down,
Well you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
