// Trouble In The Mind //

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day.

I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before.

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind,
Life ain't worth livin,
Sometimes I feel like dyin'.

Goin' down to the river

Gonna take my ol' rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock away from there.

You been a hard-hearted mama
Great god! you been unkind
Gonna be a cold, cold papa
Cause you to lose your mind.

I'm gonna lay my head down
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen
Pacify my mind.

Well it's trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my worried mind,
When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'.

// Porgy //

This song talk about the same Porgy
That we've talked about for two years now
His name is Porgy only this one was written by eh
Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh

I got my man now I got Porgy
My baby understands now I got my Porgy
I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when i feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man got my Porgy now

Though you say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
Oh oh baby I'm changing my style nad way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man I got my Porgy now

// You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To //

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire

While that breeze on night sings a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above

You'd be so nice you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

// In The Evening By The Moonlight //

In the evening by the moonlight
When my mother had finished working
We used to sit around the fire place
Till the cornbread it was done
And then we all would eat our supper
After that we'd clean the kitchen
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare
To have a little fun
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down
That hung upon the wall
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright
How the folks would enjoy it
They would sit all night and listen
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear banjos ringing
You could hear them by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear folks all singing
In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear banjos ringing
In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah
