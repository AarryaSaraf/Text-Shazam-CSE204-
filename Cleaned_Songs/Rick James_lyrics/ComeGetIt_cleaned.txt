Well alright, you freaks! Get ready to jump when he calls, here he is
Mr Funk Prophet, Rick James and the Stone City Band!

Let's get stoned, tonight! Sing!

Stone City Band, won't you funk us all along
Won't you funk us on down?
Stone City Band, let the show begin
Because we love your sound

Stone City Band, won't you funk us all on up
Won't you funk us on down?
Stone City Band, let the show begin
Because we love your sound

Come on! Ow!...

Uh-uh, don't stop now!
Showtime, y'all!
Where all you Stone City citizens, smokin' more than [?]
Get on this, sing!

We are Stone City Band... (smokin', smokin', smokin')
We are so part of the city they call ghetto land
I wanna say it again. Everybody sing:

We are Stone City Band...

...The music, that we're playing
Remember what I'm saying, that we
Understand it, understand it, understand it... understand it! Uh!

But what more can one man do, well
To take away all this city's sadness?
You're playing a funky tune
I'm gon' play it for ya
And make it funky on this city's madness
I said yeah, yeah, yeah. Sing it out!

We're a Stone City Band!

I wanna say it again
Come on girls, keep on singing

Won't you give them now?

Alright, alright! Now we spell the name, alright!

// You And I //

You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand
That's right
Don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere
You wanted to go

You and me
We are as close as three-part harmony
Wouldn't you agree
And if by chance
Our romance ended it would surely be
The end of me

Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
'Cause they really don't know
They'll never see of hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell

Whoe, baby yeah
Now sing it, sugar
Do-do-do

You and I
We'll be together til the six is nine
That's right
When you need me
I never hesitate, I always come
It's so much fun, yeah

You and I
Although we're poor
Our love has greater wealth
Than Hughes himself
And if by chance
There is an afterlife when we die
Hope it's with you and I

Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
'Cause they really don't know
They'll never see of hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell

Sing it do-do-do....

You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally

// Sexy Lady //

Funk on!

Now, there's a girl on the street
And she walks by, tries to meet you
If you're by sometime, well
She's looking good! My, my, my
Lookin' fine, well

Now, there's a man on the block
And he's checking for some money
How his money's long[?], yeah
He's talking trash! Well
Talking cash, y'all (cash-money, that is)

She said "you've got the time"
He said "where is the money?"
She said "life was no good"
He said "stop talking funny"
She said "here is your breeze"
He said "baby don't you be so mean
I love you, sexy lady
I love you, sexy lady"

Now, there's a girl, that I know
How she loves to cop-and-blow whenever I'm around, well
She keeps me up, well
Never down, y'all

She loves the lamps and to dance
And she says I'm treating romance just to past the time, yeah
I love her body! No, no, no
Love her mind, y'all

She said "you've got the time"
He said "where is the money?"
She said "life was no good"
He said "stop talking funny"
She said "here is your breeze"
He said "baby don't you be so mean
I love you, sexy lady
I love you, sexy lady"

Horns!...

// Dream Maker //

[spoken:]
When time allows my mind to sleep
When thoughts and visions of your being become as real to me as life
I then, become aware

You... Are there
With eyes closed, I can taste everywhere
(Dream Maker... Ooh)
Your eyes, your lips, your breasts, your hair
Such a dream so real, such a love I feel, I want to stay there... forever and ever...
In the realms of this dream.
Oh dream maker, oh weaver of magical dreams, make this dream come true tonight.

Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest height that we can reach

Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest heights, yeah, yeah

I'm not the kind of man who don't like to please, no
You don't have to ask me to get down on my knees for your love
I know I'm just a man; I do the best I can.
If that ain't good enough, then I get on up and try it again.

Baby, your spirits in me even when you're not around
Lord knows, when you're gone I get chills
Visions of lovemaking become so breath taking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest height that we can reach

Oh, Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest heights, yeah, yeah

Baby, I'm just a man with love on his mind
I don't like to make love too fast, just do me slow... girl, take your time.
And when lovemaking's though and we're fast asleep
And my dreams of loving you, a fantasy I made with all I have in it.

Baby, your spirits in me even when you're not around
Lord knows, when you're gone I get chills
Visions of lovemaking become so breath taking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Oh, Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest height that we can reach

Dream Maker... Make my dream come true tonight. Let me take her, to the highest heights, yeah, yeah

(Dream Maker, Ooooh)

[spoken:]
Oh dream maker, oh weaver of magical dreams, when we awake, let it be love that we make... Until it's time to dream (again)

Before this ghetto life becomes the death of me

Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa

It's like you always told me, keep your head to the sky

Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa

Mom, I've been thinking about it
You know, I've been thinking about it all my life, all my life
And I've been hoping, I've been hoping
One day I might go to Hollywood, to Hollywood
Where the singers, and the movie stars, and the people, living mountains
And the sun shines all the time
Ain't nothing much, and I got to keep on

Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
