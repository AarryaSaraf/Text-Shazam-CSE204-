// New York Town //

[Rick James:]
Wow, New York City
I need a cap
Yo - taxi!
Thanks a lot, man, for picking me up
[Taxi Driver:]
Where are you going, buddy?
[Rick James:]
Ohhm, bring me up to 125th street, Lexington Avenue, man
[Taxi Driver:]
Nah, no way, I am sorry, man, I ain't going up there
[Rick James:]
What do you mean, you sorry, you can't take me up there?
[Taxi Driver:]
Ah no, get outta my cab, I am not going into Harlem
[Rick James:]
What do you mean?
You can't leave me in the middle of the street in Manhattan
Just like that
Wow, is this a trick?
Better call me another cab
Yo - taxi!
I hope it's a brother this time

When I want to get down, I go to New York town
There I can party all night
When I walk in the door that's where you've been before
The freaks are there to give me delight
The Ladies there are everywhere
And we party from night time 'till dawn
Then I get up at 10 and do it all again
I could never stop getting it on

People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)

When I want to get high, up on my jet I'll fly
To the city where you never come down
I walk in Central Park, but never after dark
'Cause you never know who's hanging around
The Puerto Rican girls, their hair is curled
And the sisters are as fine as can be
Even the girls are a trick, they say was half as slick
And it's the only place where you can be free

People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)
People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)

(Ohh, uhh)
New York
Wow: New York
New York
New York City, New York
New York
Well, New York
New York
New York
Yeah, New York
New York
New York City, New York
Yeah, yeah

// P.I.M.P. The S.I.M.P. //

Say, girl, what's happening, baby?
You know you're sitting on a goldmine, you need to follow me
You can make lots of money
And of course I can [?] and dress and be the funnest

Mary chose a pimp
He put her on the street
It was no accident
She was found in a hotel suite
Face down in the floor, lying in her underwear
No one even cried and no even seemed to care

That Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P

Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
And she know, she is a pimpers party
She is a pimpsky light
Now she's gone and he's still left to carry on
It's so wrong
P.I.M.P., pimp

Excuse me baby, but my name is Don Wonder
And I wonder if I could buy you a drink
Cause I got something I need to run on you

Mary chose a pimp
She changed her name and moved out west
All her money went
On his wardrobe and nothing less
She even bought his house
While she lived in a motel room
Her days were spent alone with the comfort of a silver spoon

Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P

Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
Didn't she know?
Mary's going nuts out in the rain
Selling her body for pain
Giving all her money to some chump so he can dress funny
P.I.M.P., pimp
Mary's going crazy, girl is going out of her mind
Didn't she know the price she had to pay was high to be a hoe
Horns blow
P.I.M.P., pimp

You pimp, you simp, your on the street
Running your game on all the girls you meet
Fake diamonds on your fingers and Cadillac cars
Trying to catch a girl at a local bar
So you catch her and you school her and you teach her the game
Next thing you know, the girl's going insane
Now she's lost at the cost of the tricks she's turned
She's just another hoe who just been burned

Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P
Mary had a pimp
Mary had a P.I.M.P

// Tell Me (What You Want) //

Unity
Brother, sister, there's got to be
Unity, yeah

A little honesty and trust among us
A little love and harmony, and there'll surely be
Some unity
