In the shadow of the night
I hear your voice and I'm alright
It's in my ear, it sounds so clear
It makes me crazy

In the middle of a dream
I wake up to a silent scream
I can't escape your haunting sound
Please come to me, baby

And don't be trickin' (trickin', trickin', trickin')
Of my word stickin' (stickin', stickin', stickin')
When I'm with you, and you're with me
My love's alive and kickin'

Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah
Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah

In the middle of a day
I think of every word you say
When we lay down, I feel like we're
So close we are one

At the end of every night
I think of how I hold you tight
The words I said, we lay in bed
Lost in each other's eyes

Love, don't be trickin' (trickin', trickin', trickin')
Of my word stickin' (stickin', stickin', stickin')
When I'm with you, and you're with me
My love's alive and kickin'

// Day And Night //

Making love with you was just so easy, baby
Like counting from one to three
Choosing you to be with was so pleasing, sugar
Eternally, yeah

Giving up my body was a rustling, darling
The night I remember well
How I watched you tremble and your body quiver
Girl, now don't you tell

Just you wait and see what I have in store
(Just you wait and see, baby)
Talking sexually, I will give you more
(Talking sexually, darling)
Feel the nature rising this heart of mine
(Feel the nature rising)
I will do it better to you, girl next time

I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
Oooh yeah yeah, baby

I wanna make love to you day and night
Yeah, yeah

Day and night
With you baby, you baby, you baby, you baby

I wanna give you something to remember, baby (remember, baby)
You know I really can (you know I really can)
Satisfy the need that you've been missing, honey (missing, honey)
Do you understand (do you understand)

Move a little closer, let's get deeper baby (deeper baby)
Into this love affair (into this love affair)
I wanna taste the passions of a million kisses (million kisses)
Everywhere!

And just you wait and see what I have in store
(Just you wait and see, baby)
Talking sexually, I will give you more
(Talking sexually, darling)
Feel the nature rising this heart of mine

Hey-hey-hey-hey-ey

Ooh, uh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Frankie was a brother
And his skin was just as dark as night
Suzy was a sister
And just coloured pretty Suzey, very white

They met in a nightclub
Somewhere in the year of '89
Suzy told her girl friends
"Well I think that colored boy is really fine"
Oh yeah

They look so wild and crazy, yeah
Check them out and see, yeah
I think I'll let the walls down to my prison
Let my heart go free, yeah

Now wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Don't care what people say, naw
Step into the dark side of the rainbow

What I'll do is right
Just a silly game of Black and White
Be it together

Talkin' about Black and White
Black and White
Be it together

Talkin' about Black and White
What color you are

Oh say, can you see (can you see)
Just what color you are (just what color that you are)
Black, yellow or white (black or white)
Everybody is a star (everybody is a star)

Frankie looked at Suzy
And he caught her staring in his eyes
Suzy's girl friends told her
What was happening just wasn't very wise, now
Oh no

If it was another world
They'd met each other face to face
No one ever heard the conversation
That was taking place
Oh no

Do you wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Maybe take a chance, yeah
If the talk that they may talk about us
May I have this dance, baby

Do you wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Break the silly rules, yeah
Maybe if we get to know each other

Groove out all the fools [?]
Bring it to the light
Cause when you break it down
It's just silly games of Black and White

Be it together
Talkin' about Black and White
Black and White
Be it together
Talkin' about Black and White

So just stand and be proud (be proud)
Sing a song, sing it loud (sing it soft and sing it loud)
Bring the truth to the light (bring it to the light)
Come together black and white (come together, come together)

("Calling people of the world") come together
("Black boys, white girls") come together
("I have a dream") come together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come together ("black boys, white girls")
Come together ("calling people of the world")
Come together ("as sisters and brothers")
("I have a dream") Come together now!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Black and white
("I had a dream today")

Come together

Cause of all the things I'd do for you
But if the world thinks I'm crazy, I don't mind
I'll do what I got to do

Steal, break stuff, sting[?], I'll shoot someone to deliver
Anything your heart desires

And it's just a waste of time
But they just don't understand I can't quit it
Girl, I got to make you mine

Rob, steal, beg, deal, do everything that I gotta
Just to keep you close to me
Pay, bray, leave, stay, anything that you wanna
Just say you'll stay, and maybe be with me

You know I never doubt you, I can't live without you

To give you my all
I know you will remember that time when in September
We had us a ball

Remember, we were wasted, and oh, how sweet you tasted
With kiss after kiss
I know I won't forget it, but girl I just can't quit it
I just can't resist

// Get Wit It //

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

Can't nobody ever say, what they will not do
Give them just a minute, you will change a mind or two
Kissing on the right face, softly on the right place, now
Make you do some strange things, and until your face brings smile

Oo-oo-oo-ooh

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

I know it's just incredible, I gotta bust this
And run a rhyme about a feeling that I know you miss
It's self-explainable, it's so attainable
Just like a higher level, that you wanna reach
Or like a war of practice[?], but you never preach
Say he's so reliable, but so deniable
Or everytime you see him, you're so triable
Stop fakin', you know you want him!

You always tell your friends, that you never just get loose and play
Now I understand why they never hear a word you say
Everytime you see me, you always act so strange and shy
Stuck-up little cute girl, and now I know the reasons why

Oo-oo-oo-ooh

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

He reads you like it's history, you're not a mystery
You're like a light show, ready girl and good to go
He wanna try you, and he could buy you
And if your loving is that good he won't deny you
You wanna play it cool? Oh really, who's the fool?
You heard the rumour and it said that he was really cruel
You got your own mind, and give it in time
He is the champagne, and you're the cheap wine
You're gonna write your friends, and talk about him
What's in your dreams, and now you never doubt him
It's really plain to see, he is your fantasy
And in his life girl, is where you wanna be

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
I could get it (like this y'all), I could get it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Let me get it (like this y'all), come and get it

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
I could get it (like this y'all), I could get it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it (like this y'all), come girl and get-get wit' it

Get it
Get it
Get wit' it

Show me what you really wanna do for me tonight girl, girl...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)
Let me just go down on you, so I can finally feel it too, too...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)
Give me so much joy, that I will always be your love toy, toy...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)

Oh, do it just like that...

// Rock And Roll Eyes //

Can you remember long ago
You were my first real love
Elvis was on the rise
Singing for both of us

Can you remember yesterday
It breaks my heart, when I
Think of how our love went astray
Hurts me like when Hendrix died

Gave me a reason for living
Gave me a reason to try
Gave me a love I could see through, yeah
Looking in your rock and roll eyes

All these memories (all those memories)
They are fading (fading, fading, fading)
And they just keep on fading fast
If you come back, oh, I'll be waiting (waiting, waiting)
Ooh yeah, yeah

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If we only knew love hurts so much,
Would we play that song again?
Could we make the same mistakes?
Would Jimmy Dean ride again?

Give me a reason for living
Give me a reason to try
Give me a love I could see through, yeah
Looking in your rock and roll eyes

All these memories (all those memories)
They are fading (fading, fading, fading)
And they just keep on fading fast
If you come back, I'll be waiting (waiting, waiting)
Ooh yeah, yeah

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
Yeah, yeah, yeeeah...

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again...
