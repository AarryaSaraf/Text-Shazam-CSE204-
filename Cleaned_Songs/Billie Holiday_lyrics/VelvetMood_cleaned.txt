// Everything I Have Is Yours //

Everything I have is yours
You are part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny

I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine
Everything that I posses, I offer you

Let my dream of happiness come through
I'll be happy just to spent my life
Waiting at your back end call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

Everything I have is yours
You are part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny

I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine
Everything that I posses, I offer to you

Let my dream of happiness come through
I'll be happy just to spent my life
Waiting at your back end call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

// Prelude To A Kiss //

If you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
My prelude to a kiss

// When Your Lover Has Gone //

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers life can't mean anything
When your lover, when your lover has gone

// Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone //

Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

// I Gotta Right To Sing The Blues //

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
A certain man in this little town

Keeps draggin' my poor heart around
All I see for me is misery

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan inside
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
A certain man in this little town

Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me
It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to sing the blues

I gotta right to moan and cry
I gotta sit and sigh

Down around the river
Soon that deep blue sea
Will be callin' me

It must be love say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues

There's nothing left for me
I'm full of misery
I gotta right to sing the blues

// What's New? //

What's new
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever, I must admit
What's new
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking, what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed, I still love you so

What's new
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever, I must admit

But how can you know, I love you so

// I Hadn't Anyone Till You //

I hadn't anyone till you
I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be,
A someone in the wide world just made for me
Now I see I had to save my love for you
I never gave my love till you
And thru my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you.
