// School Boy Crush //

Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four
Wait till everybody's (long) gone
There must be so many things that we can explore
Maybe I can walk you home
If it starts to rain, we can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

She said hey, wait a minute, hold on
She said hey, just a little bit, hold on
When ever I try to think of what it feels like to feel it
For the first time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy, but don't you touch

That ain't much, only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret, can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
(But) we should take it rather slow
If we play it cool, it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we will be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

// It's A Mystery //

When I hear you call my name
So soft and low
I get to feel so good
Way down inside of me
You could have had the choice
Of anyone you want
I can't understand why you're here
Right here beside me now, oh baby

It's a mystery
What you see in me
I know I got to
Keep on seeing you
It's a mystery
What you see in me

When I speak to you
Over the telephone
I just want to be right there
Beside you, girl
Cause holding you and loving you
Is on my mind
I'm so glad, I'm so glad
You feel the same way too

// Groovin' The Night Away //

We didn't come around here to sit around and mope, no no
We didn't come around here to sit like this and lookin' bored
We came down here to party
That's what we're gonna do
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away

I know that times are tough
But it ain't here, not tonight, no no
Get up off your backside
Got to d it right
Let's roll up the carpet
Time to get down
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away

Now that we got started
Let's keep keepin' on till dawn
I won't stop until I drop
Got to get it on
We came down here to party
That's what we're goin' do
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away

// If I Ever Lose This Heaven //

If you're foolin', only foolin'
All I ask is "why?"
And if you're playin', all I'm sayin' is
Feelings sure can lie
And if you're lyin', keep on lyin'
Don't tell the truth, don't you dare
You can't drop me, baby you still got me
After takin' me way up there (way up there yeah)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven
Oh, I'll never be the same (not the same no)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven (ooh)
Oh, I'll never be the same (never be the same no)

When you're kind, ooh extra kind
Then suddenly oh baby get cross
You're so moody, but you really get to me
And I can't turn you off whoa
You're fascinating, much more fascinating
Than the dark side of the moon
You're so exciting, hey babe I'm re-writing
This book of love called "you" (yes it's you)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven ooh
Oh, I'll never be the same (never never be the same)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven ooh
Whoa, I'll never be the same (no)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven (if I ever lose it baby)
Whoa, I'll never (never never baby)
Never (no I won't no)
Never (never)
Never (be the same)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven whoa
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven
Oh, I'll never be the same (never be the same oh)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven...

// Why //

Why did love bring us together
I wonder if it was real or
Whether it was something out of time
A situation we could not explain
Could it be your love was just like
Sunshine turned to rain

Try as hard as I may, girl
I can find nothing to say, cause
Yesterday you walked right out on me
An I can't find the reason why
Still I can't decide if it was really my
Mistake that made you break away from me
All I have left is the memory

Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
You made me believe
I needed something more than what I had
Then you had to leave
And all it did was make me sad

Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
You made me believe
I needed something more than what I had
Then you had to leave
And all it did was make me sad
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you...

// High Flyin' Woman //

Stand up
Don't let the people get you down
Play some funky music, get dancin'
Better than hangin' around
You got to fight, fight
The blues ain't strong enough to beat you
Come on out tonight, don't need money
I'll be there to meet you

'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again

Time was
We were just like sister and brother
But you got hung on him, all the time
He treated you like the others
Hey now
He's gone from your life, let's celebrate
Put on these high-heeled shoes, paint your face
Got no time to waste

'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again

Hey, hey, gonna make you a high-steppin' chicken again
Hey, hey, come on baby, come on out tonight
'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again
Forget about the past
You'll never see that man again
'Cause I believe I can make you
A high flyin' woman again

// Cloudy //

Cloudy, use to be so easy to love you
Now babe, you seem to have a million problems on your mind, at the one time
Cloudy don't you drift away, ooh
Cloudy don't you drift away
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely (slowly but surely, oh babe)
Oh baby, maybe I could be the one to help you solve, all those things
Just try all you have to do is open up that door, ooh
What are you waiting for
Cloudy don't you drift away (don't you drift away)
Cloudy, don't you drift away, no, no
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely (slowly but surely oh babe)
Oh baby, oh baby, ooh
What you trying to prove, by turning me away

Your killing my love, ooh
What we had, ooh, is it real again, is it real again, ooh
Cloudy don't you drift away (don't you drift away)
Cloudy, don't you drift away, yeah
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely (slowly but surely oh babe)
Oh baby, oh baby, yeah
Cloudy, don't you drift away, yeah
Cloudy, Oh you seem so far away
Feel like I'm losing you slowly but surely, oh baby
Cloudy, don't you drift away
Cloudy, don't you drift away

// How Sweet Can You Get //

You git a way about you, lady
You can charm the birds right out of the trees with your sweetness
Maybe if I stayed around you long enough
I might find how good this thing could be

Can you get sweeter than sugar
Can you get sweeter than wine
Can you get sweeter than perfume
Can you get sweeter than sunshine

How sweet can you get
Oh baby, how sweet can you get
How sweet can you get
Just how sweet can you get
How sweet can you get, how sweet

Ooh when you smile at me the clouds all disappear
You are warmer than a sunny sunny day in L.A. baby
Still it seems too perfect and I really got to know
That is why I got one question for you
And I just gotta say

Can you get sweeter than honey
Can you get sweeter than wine
Can you get sweeter than roses
Can you get sweeter than sunshine

Something kinda tells me
That the best is yet to come

How sweet can you get
How sweet can you get
...

// When They Bring Down The Curtain //

When they bring down the curtain
Everybody's gonna think it's over
In the back of my mind I know
It's only the start of the show
When they bring down the curtain
That's when my troubles begin
When it gets to you, girl
That's the hardest part to win

Sitting here in my room backstage
With only my thoughts to keep me company
Read the script again from an empty page
Still I see your face in front of me
But I can't let this feeling take over
I've got to go out and play my part
No one else realizes
I'm doing it all with an aching heart tonight

The houselights dim and the show has begun
All the lines seem to flow so easily
People laugh but I can't join the fun
All my words just echo back at me
Still I go through the motions
Tell a joke, pull a funny face
No one else has a notion
I've lost something that I can't replace tonight

When they bring down the curtain
Everybody's gonna think it's over
In the back of my mind I know
It's only the start of the show
When they bring down the curtain
That's when my troubles begin
When it gets to you, girl
That's the hardest part to win
