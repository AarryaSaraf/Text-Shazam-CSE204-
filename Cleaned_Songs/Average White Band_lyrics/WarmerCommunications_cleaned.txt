// Your Love Is A Miracle //

Your love is a miracle
Much more than a habit to me
Your love is a miracle
Black magic in the first degree

I get by on your sweetness
Got a taste for that kind of
Sugar in my tea
Don't you cut off my supply
There's no substitute for
This burning desire
You've given me

When I come home at night
Lookin' for something
To make me feel all right

Just to tease me you hold back
Uh, you shouldn't do that
I'll go crazy and do something
You might not like

Baby when I'm out of reach
Never really out of touch
You know you keep me hummin'
So please promise me, wherever I might be
Your love (will) keep me coming through

// Same Feeling, Different Song //

I used to wake up at night
With this song going through my mind
Tried so hard to write is all down
But the melody was hard to find
Then one night about a week ago
I was passing a nightclub door
I heard something
That made me turn around
I had to go inside for more

It was the same feeling
A different song
Thought I'd heard it before
But it must be wrong
Same beat, just a different groove
Whatever it I
Makes you want to move, move, move

Those people were dancing a new thing
Going crazy before my eyes
I felt the shivers come over me
Knew I had to take a run outside
I went back home and turned my radio on
The D.J. had just begun

He said this song is a mystery to me
But I know it has to be a number one

It had the same feeling
A different song
Thought I'd heard it before
But it must be wrong
Same beat, but a different groove
Whatever it is
Makes you want to move, move, move

I thought it was the same old thing
But as I listened
Something changed
Now everywhere I go it keeps on
Haunting me
It was that same feeling
To find out what the secret is
Is easy said but hard to do
I leave it up to you to solve the mystery
It was the same feeling

// Daddy's All Gone //

I don't have much to say
Thought I'd call you up anyway
Just to try to show you the way
That I feel today
I miss you, baby

I sure am on the road
I don't need to say much more
Just the same old well, known stranger
That I was before
It seems like yesterday now

Daddy's all gone
Only half way home
He's holding on to the telephone
Saying please don't let the show go on

There's a bus every other hour

There's even the midnight train
But that don't leave me the power
To see your face again
It's not that simple

You see there's a room full
Of smiling faces
There's a man standing by the door
Say it's time to change our places
And get down on the floor
Kill 'em, baby

Daddy's all gone
He's just half way home
He's holding on to the microphone
Singing please don't make the show go on

// Big City Lights //

Hey, (look at) those big city lights
They won't shine tonight for me
It's raining, I'm walking the streets
My heart is way down, down in my shoes
Talking, talking to myself
There's nobody else who can hear me

Your love put me on the corner
When I came back and found you were gone
Tonight I feel the city won't
Let me come home

Hey, (look at) those big city lights
They used to be so friendly to me
I came to New York to make it our home
Now you've gone and left me here, here on my own
East side, West side, who's on my side
If I could find where you are I might know

Laughing and drinking
With bad weather friends

Makes me forget for a while
But every time I drain my glass
All I can see is your smile

Hey, (look at) those big city lights
Buildings closing in on me
Hey, (look at) those big city lights
Only make it harder to see

I can't believe you really left me
All this time you said I was your man
But I'm gonna find you
And I know that I can
Know that I can

Hey
Tell me what about those big city lights

// She's A Dream //

Yes, she was beautiful
And she smiled at me
As she passed my way
In the heat of the noon day sun
Oh the promise of those eyes
Got me hypnotized
I ask her to stay
And continue what she's begun
She stayed and I wondered why
As the time flew by
Day faded away into the night
It all felt so perfect
When it dawned on me
I saw the light

She was a dream
Disappearing as quick
As she came into view
When I awoke to find
She was a dream

Tried to get myself back to sleep
To chase her shadow along the night
Keep this illusion alive
I felt that we'd met before
On another shore some other time
She was a love of mine

Oh she was a dream
Thought that my ship had come in
Then I awoke to find
She was a dream

Every night I lay me down to sleep
I pray that I'll find her again
Though I know in my heart
She's a dream
She's a dream

When I think of that island day
The ocean spray the burning sand
It all seems so real
And if we ever meet again
Somewhere out there
I know just how I feel

She was a dream
Every night I lay me down to sleep
I pray that I'll find her again
Thought I know in my heart
She's a dream
She's a dream
Oh, I know
She's a dream...

Just my imagination running away with me
Ooh I don't even know her name
Ooh gonna find her, gotta find her
She's a dream
She's a dream

// Warmer Communications //

If you know what's right for you
I know what's right for me
I won't tell you what to do
But I'll tell you what I see
We gotta change the way it is
Try to keep it tight
Acting just like strangers
Surely can't be right

It's got to be warmer
We got to have warmer, warmer, warmer
Warmer communications

Trying hard to touch you
If I might be so bold
Trying hard to reach you
Don't put me on hold

If we can't communicate
If we don't even try
Standing here like losers
The world will pass us by

It's got to be warmer
We got to have warmer, warmer, warmer
Warmer communications

Burrrr.. it's so cold
I can't feel you
Burrrr.. it's so cold
I can't reach you

// The Price Of The Dream //

The price of the dream is dear
Let me make it clear
Let me make it clear to you right now

Look at me, do you think I would try
Breaking your heart
There is no reason to tear yourself apart
No, no
The price of the dream is dear, let me make
It clear
Let me say that I would do all that I can
For you

You know what we got to do
I can see through your eyes too
It takes some understanding

To see it through without demanding
A little bit of give and take is what it needs
You and me that's the way I always want
It to stay

Please tell me baby
Do you think we can make this sacrifice
The bumpy road to love, is worth all that
It costs
The price of the dream is clear
It's already here right now, right now
Right here and now
The price of the dream is dear
Let me make it clear, right now
The price of the dream is clear

// One Look Over My Shoulder (Is This Really Goodbye?) //

Here we are, untogether
Wish I could say that it isn't so
We've put each other through so much pain
It doesn't make sense anymore
Still it tears me up inside to think
That I might never see you again

I can't pretend
We've been through so much stormy weather
While we've been together
I can't coldly walk away I gotta have

One look over my shoulder
One last look in your eyes
The outlook may be colder
Is this really good-bye

It's too late, got to face it
We've come to a fork in the road
The signpost shows a different way
And I realize
I've got to stop thinking with my heart
Make a new start
We've come through so much stormy weather
Tried to stay together
I can't simply walk away without

One look over my shoulder
One last look in your eyes
The outlet may be colder
Is this really good-bye
