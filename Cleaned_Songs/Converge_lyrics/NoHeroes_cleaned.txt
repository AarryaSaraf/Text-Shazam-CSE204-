Album: NoHeroes

// Heartache //

We are all falling down
We are all falling down
We are all falling down
We are all falling

Every word that you pray
Makes another slave
Every idol that you build
Brings another plague
Every cross that you bear
Grows another grave

We are all falling down
We are all falling down
We are all falling down
We are all falling
Down, down, down
We are all falling down

Under the weight
Of our heartache
Under the weight
Of their mistakes

// Hellbound //

For lost hope and his son
I'll avenge what once was
For his name and his love
These cold hands spill their blood

For lost hope and his son
I'll avenge what once was
For his name and his love
These cold hands spill their blood

Grant me the strength
To stand up straight
To make them pay
Spill their blood

Grant me the strength
To bear this weight
Show me the way
Spill their blood

// Sacrifice //

Hit the lights
I've had enough
Hit the lights
I've had enough

Guilt to build a city
Shame to fill a sea
Reasons to give up
And lose everything
Regret to burn this body
Filth to cut these bands
Reasons to bury this
And everything we have

Hit the lights
I've had enough
Hit the lights
I've had enough

Guilt to build a city
Shame to fill a sea
Reasons to give up
And lose everything
Regret to burn this body
Filth to cut these bands
Reasons to bury this
And everything we have

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the...

I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care

// Vengeance //

Enemies' eve
Burn to believe
Guns in the ground
Are all I see

Love, liars, thieves
All targets to me

Jaws at my heels
Mean nothing to me
Knives at your throats
All that I see
Don't doubt in me

I am vengeance
Built for war

// No Heroes //

In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate

Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are
And who you claim to be

No more heroes
No more heroes
No more heroes
No more heroes

In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate

No more
No more
No more
I walk alone
No more
No more
No more
I walk alone

In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone

In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are
And who you claim to be

// Plagues //

Dark days
Greet us with teeth
With claws her wings climb
Cold eyes gaze wide with awe
With spite
Everyone, everywhere
Every beast, every man pays her price

// Grim Heart / Black Rose //

When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When I build coffin worlds with words
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black

When I see me in your eyes
I just want to go blind
When our words build coffin worlds
I just want a place to hide
When old ghosts meet new regrets
My daylight fades to grey
When our days bring guilt and shame
My heart turns black

These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted for you
These are my tombs
Painted black and blue
These are my tombs
Painted just for you

Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye
Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye

Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye
Goodnight
Goodnight, dear
Goodbye

Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light
Black rose, be my light

In the darkest of days
Be my heart
In the darkest of nights
Be my heart
In the darkest of days
Be my heart
In the darkest of nights
Be my heart

// Orphaned //

Bright eyes fading
Young eyes beaten
To black and blue
Sunrise has been sinking
Since I was two

One wounded
And another dead
One wounded
And another dead

I've spent years
Building up these walls
When all this time
My sky has been falling

Burden to bare
This anger is
Empty but heavy
My heart carries
The weight of your world

One wounded
And another dead
One wounded
And another dead

My wounds are open
I'm out of blood

Bright eyes fading
Young eyes beaten
To black and blue
Sunrise has been sinking
Since I was two

Burden to bare
This anger is
Empty but heavy
My heart carries
The weight of your world

// Lonewolves //

From a victim to a friend
Don't ever let them in
Keep your scars on your sleeve
And your heart in your hands
All the whores with their wars
Their gaping mouths want more
All of them choke on regret
We sit in silence

Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you

From a victim to a friend
Don't ever let them in
Keep your scars on your sleeve
And your heart in your hands
All the whores with their wars
Their gaping mouths want more
All of them choke on regret
We sit in silence

Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you
Dead or dedicated
Alive or medicated
A coward queen or harlot heart, it's up to you

This world owes you nothing
This world owes me nothing
This world owes us nothing
This world owes us nothing

This world owes us nothing
But a hard road to walk
These mountains that we climb
Is everything we've lost

This world owes us nothing
But a hard road to walk
These mountains that we move
Is everything we've lost

It's all up to me and you

// Versus //

Now it's us versus them
Now, just us versus them

Jaws are biting at your heels
We hunt you in bad dreams
We know just what you are
The secrets that you keep
Cloven hoof is pounding
Faster than your heart
Strength in desperation
And the sting of loss

Time to cut them down
It's us versus them
Time to take a stand
It's us versus them

Jaws are biting at your heels
We hunt you in bad dreams
We know just what you are
The secrets that you keep
Cloven hoof is pounding
Faster than your heart
Strength in desperation
And the sting of loss

Time to cut them down
It's us versus them
Time to take a stand
It's us versus them

Now it's us versus them
Now, just us versus them

// Trophy Scars //

In pure ghost white I see what was mine
Drowned in jet black that haunts your shadows
Endless night begins
This forked road now bends
A forked tongue appears to lead us astray

All this that I have is all that you are
Cutting for love a new trophy scar
Just not worth the tears and penance
Not worth the blood that we both pour

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
Without your name
Without this pain

Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn we will someday
Born to burn with hell to pay
Born to burn we will someday

Born born to burn with hell with hell to pay
Born born to burn we will we will someday

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name

I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without this pain
I want to live without the guilt we give
I want to die without your name

// Bare My Teeth //

In cold blood I claim this day
I charge blind into the fray
In the name of all my pain
I bare my teeth to make him pay
I sink on down and greet her end
With the worms and the dead
With serpent strength and true hate
I bare my teeth to make her pay

I take my flight

In cold blood I claim this day
I charge blind into the fray
In the name of all my pain
I bare my teeth to make him pay
I sink on down and greet her end
With the worms and the dead
With serpent strength and true hate
I bare my teeth to make her pay

I take my flight

I will take flight
For one last time
With raven wings
And two black eyes
Don't be afraid
With demon speed
The gift of hate
I bare my teeth
To make them pay
Don't be afraid

Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere
Nowhere to hide

// To The Lions //

To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

This raging sea won't have you
This weary grave won't keep you
These tired arms won't hold you
As she closes her doors

To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

Inferno dreams won't leave you
This moonless night won't guide you
These brittle ghosts won't love you
As she closes her doors

Queen of guilt
Queen of grief

To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

This raging sea won't have you
This weary grave won't keep you
These tired arms won't hold you
As she closes her doors

Queen of guilt
Queen of grief

Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
