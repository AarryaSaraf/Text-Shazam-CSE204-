// Just Like That //

Just like that, just like that
You are walking out of my room, just like that

Just like that, just like that
You are walking out of my room, just like that

Saw you packing up your things, all your jewels and rings
So if you have to go
I won't say no

Saw you packing up your things, oh, all your diamonds and rings
But if you have to go
I won't say no

I say, just like that, just like that
Just like that
You are walking out of my room, just like that

Want you to know that I love you so
So if you have to go, if you have to go, if you have to go
I won't say no
No, no, no

I miss you away, but you don't understand
So, if you have to go, if you have to go, if you have to go
I won't say no, won't say no

Just like that, just like that
Just like that
You are walking out of my room, just like that

Just like that, just like that
Just like that
You are walking out of my room, just like that
