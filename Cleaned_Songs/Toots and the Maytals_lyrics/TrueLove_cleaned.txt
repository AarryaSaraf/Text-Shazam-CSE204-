Album: TrueLove

// True Love Is Hard To Find //

You say that your love was just for me
And that's why I've got to be yours
You told me the day will never come
When you will walk out on me
'Cause you know that true love is hard to find
Of course you know that true love is hard to find
Just because you know that true love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very hard to find
I say true love, true love, true love, true love, true love is hard to find
You told me that you know I have to travel all over
That you would take care of my business for me
But darling all I ask of you is to leave those business alone
And say your love endures for me

'Cause I know that true love is hard to find
Of course I know that true love is hard to find
I believe true love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very, very hard to find
I say true love, true love, true love, true love, true love is hard to find
And know it fills my heart with joy forever and love for you
Darling I always think of you
And always know my heart fills with love for you
'Cause I know that true love is hard to find

// Still Is Still Moving To Me //

Still Is Still Moving to Me
With Willie Nelson

Still is still moving to me
I swim like a fish in the sea
All the time
But if that's what it takes to be free
I don't mind
Still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

And it's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words
But I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

// Sweet And Dandy //

Eh hey!
Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must, "wipe her eyes"
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Johnson in the room a fret
Uncle say he must, "hold up him head!"
Aunty say, "him nuh fi foolish like a nuh time fi him wedding day"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
Twenty bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up inna white
Fi go eat out Johnson wedding cake

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must, "wipe her eyes"
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Johnson inna room a fret
Uncle say he must, "hold up him head!"
Aunty say, "him nuh fi foolish like a nuh time fi him wedding day"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
And 20 bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up inna white
Fi go eat out Johnson wedding cake

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Hey
But it was sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy
Sweet and dandy

It was sweet and dandy!
It was sweet and dandy!
It was sweet and dandy!
