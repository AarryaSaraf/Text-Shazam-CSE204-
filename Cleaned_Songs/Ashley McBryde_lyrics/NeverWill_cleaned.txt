Album: NeverWill

// Hang In There Girl //

About fifteen, grey sweatpants
On the edge of the road, puttin' up a flag
On a beat-up mailbox
Barely hanging on

Half a mile on the other side
Of the low water bridge and the poverty line
Two old mutts and a single wide
That's home

I know, all too well, that look in her eyes
Yeah, I've been right there
At the end of that drive

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Tangled up in the small town weeds
Dreamin' of the day you leave
And all the places you wanna be
I know

A set of wheels, a set of keys
You can almost feel that summer breeze
Check the oil and the anti-freeze
And go

When that moment comes, buckle up and hold on tight
Yeah, I've been right there
At the end of that drive

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Trust me when I say you're doin' fine
You know, growin' up takes a little time

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Alright

// One Night Standards //

I ain't gonna stay for the weekend
I ain't gonna jump off the deep end
I ain't gonna ask where your ring is
Thing is, we all got secrets

You don't wanna hear about my last break up
I don't wanna worry 'bout space you take up
I don't even care if you're here when I wake up

It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view

I don't want a number, you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards

Well, I ain't Cinderella either, but who is?
Call me what you want if the shoe fits
I ain't gonna say I never do this, 'cause truth is
Lonely makes a heart ruthless

Ain't nobody gonna hurt nobody
Ain't nothing wrong with needing somebody
You can leave all that
Down in the lobby

It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view

No, I don't want a number, you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards

Well how it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view

No, I don't give a damn about the morning after
Bottles on the floor, don't even matter
I don't want a number, you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
The one night standards
The one night standards

// Shut Up Sheila //

Shut up Sheila
Can't you see we're all talking?
Why don't you and Jesus take a walk down the hallway?
Shut up Sheila
It's already so loud from these damn machines
Can't my mama's mama just die in peace?
Shut up Sheila

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way
We drink and we get high
We laugh at the wrong time
We don't cry
And we don't pray
Oh, we don't cry
We don't pray

Shut up Sheila
This here is a family thing
And ain't nobody bought you a ring
Shut up Sheila
I don't remember askin' you
And if we wanna throw the ashes off a goddamned roof
Then we're goin' to

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way
We drink and we get high
We laugh at the wrong time
We don't cry
And we don't pray
Oh, we don't cry
We don't pray

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way

// First Thing I Reach For //

Brown liquor in black coffee puts my headache off for now
The hurt last night put on me still spinning me around
And I light up a smoke, even though I can hardly breathe
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

Another night of bad decisions, there's one still laying in my bed
The bastard in me wishes he'd've woke up first and left
And you'd think a girl on fire would stay away from gasoline
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

Oh the last thing I need is to need you like I do
And the first thing I reach for is anything but you
If I can keep away the lonely for a moment, well that's good enough for me
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

If I can keep away the lonely for a moment, well that's good enough for me
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

// Voodoo Doll //

You know how this town talks
But I didn't hear a thing
I just had a feeling, rattle in my bones
I saw what I saw now I can't unsee it

Scratches on my wall
Her face in my mirror
Whispers down the hall
Smoke on the ceiling

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin' it
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

It's one hell of a curse
I know she ain't sleepin' 'cause I ain't sleepin'
Damn, those kisses hurt
They ain't gonna stop
So I've been keeping salt around my door
Red candle burning
Better light one more, it ain't workin'

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin' it
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin'
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

You've got yourself a voodoo doll

// Sparrow //

Telephones and post cards
I called you from the lobby bar on Tuesday
How's the Okra coming up?
And boy, I wish I had me some
Save me a plate
Yeah, I've been sleeping alright
I get a couple days in July
Kiss Dad for me, I love you both, goodnight

Sparrow, oh it wouldn't trade nothing for the way it feels to fly
It ain't fair though, how you miss the ground when you're out here in the sky
Higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

Hard rain over Fayetteville
Jack and Coke, a sleeping pill
Living the dream
30, 000 feet down there, you're
Waking daddy up in his chair
And cutting the lights and locking the door
And saying a prayer

For a sparrow, wouldn't trade nothing for the way it feels to fly
It ain't fair though, how you miss the ground when you're out here in the sky
You're higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

And higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

Sparrow
Sparrow
Sparrow

// Martha Divine //

I've got this feeling
And I got this shovel
Between me and you and it
You're in a little trouble
I saw you sneaking
And I know what happened
I think it's kinda funny you got caught
Only, I ain't laughing

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel, you're bound for Hell
But evidently, the devil was busy so I moved you up in line, Martha Divine

Well, you call him 'Darling'
And I call him 'Daddy'
And Daddy says he'll whup me if I don't keep momma happy
Honor thy father
Honor thy mother
But The Bible doesn't say a damn thing about your daddy's lover

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel, you're bound for Hell
But evidently, the devil was busy 
So I moved you up in line, Martha Divine

Momma's an angel
My daddy isn't
Looks like a little more of him rubbed off on me than didn't
Well, I'll leave you to it
They'll never prove it
And if they ever find out, I'll say, "The devil made me do it"

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Martha Divine, your ass is mine
And it ain't murder if I bury you alive
Martha Divine

// Velvet Red //

Velvet red
Velvet red
He'd come callin'
Velvet red

There was a narrow road to that old foot path
Where the briar tangles into the muscadine
That old, abandoned cabin
Was the perfect place for forbidden love to hide

She was the mayor's eldest daughter
She had a taste for the fruit of the vine
And he was a poor boy down in that holler
Who made his living on his homemade wine

Velvet red
Velvet red
He'd come callin'
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
She'd come runnin'
Velvet red

Don't you know their love grew, like the wild flowers do?
She'd start to miss him with an awful thirst
And when that sun went down, she'd go sneakin' out
And he'd be waitin', callin' out to her

Velvet red
Velvet red
Makin' love on
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
They were drunk on
Velvet red

There was a child born twenty years ago
To a mother who never wed
Though she gave no name for the father
She called her daughter little velvet red

Velvet red
Velvet red
Mama calls me
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
My mama calls me
Velvet red

// Stone //

You sat as still as one at the dinner table
With nothing to say after grace
You were hard as one 'cause you had to be
Yeah, the oldest ones turn out that way

And if I had me one for every time you let me down
I'd build a wall
I guess I did
Yeah, you taught me all about which ones sink
Which ones skip

But there's throwin' ones
And rollin' ones
Gettin' us to open up was like gettin' blood from one
The steppin' kind
The steady kind
The, "Hey, I've got your back," ones you can stand behind
I'm just now findin' out now that you're gone
We were cut from the same stone

I sway like you
When I get nervous
I'm shy like you, but most folks couldn't tell
I get the same shade of red as you did when I'm angry
I'm red right now 'cause I'm mad as hell

At the throwin' ones
The rollin' ones
Gettin' us to open up was like gettin' blood from one
The steppin' kind
The steady kind
The, "Hey, I've got your back," ones you can stand behind
I'm just now findin' out now that you're gone
We were cut from the same stone

Yeah, there's a lot of things that should be written in one
But your name ain't one of 'em
So I carry one
And it's a heavy one

I'm just now findin' out now that you're gone
We were cut from the same stone
The same stone

// Never Will //

I heard go on, and go
But just know where you're goin' is a dead end
Playin' in bars only makes you
The star of a house band
And sometimes the hardest part
Was just to keep playin'
I'd been gone long ago if I'd listened
To what they were sayin', what they were sayin'

But I didn't, I don't, I never will
No, they just started a fire they can't control
And I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
Knowin' I didn't, I don't, I never will

They said "Seein' your name up in lights
You know it's gonna change ya
You'll look in the mirror some night
And you'll see a stranger"
But you gotta play the game
If you ever wanna play to the big crowds
You've gone as far as you'll ever go
Unless you're willin' to sell out, girl, sell out

Well, I didn't, I don't, I never will
No, they just started a fire they can't control
And I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
Knowin' I didn't, I don't, I never will
Oh, I never will

Money and fame it'll go to your head if you get it
They never did understand all the reasons we did it
I can point out the names and the faces of the people who said it
Oh, but honestly, I just don't want 'em to get any credit

Oh, I didn't, no, I never will, I never will
Oh, they just started a fire they can't control, oh no, no
And you know I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
The way it feels
I didn't, I don't, I never will
I never will

// Styrofoam //

In 1941, a physicist named Ray McEntire
Rediscovered a method first discovered by Carl Munters
An inventor from Sweden, you knew that, right?
Yeah, I looked it up
Anyway, ol' Ray found a way to make large quantities
Of extrudent polystyrene in a closed-cell foam form
That was resistant to moisture

But you and I know it as styrofoam
Which reminds me, tonight, on my way home
I need to hit the Kwik Sak
And for five bucks, I got myself a portable box
I can fill with ice and keep all my Natty Lights
Nice and cold
You gotta love styrofoam

You can cram it down in your flower pots
Get it in peanut form and fill up a box
So that the crappy ash tray that your kid made in class
To send to Grandpappy don't get cracked along the way
Hey, it's also used to make rafts for the US Military
I'm for anything that supports the US Military
Thousands of usages, all kinds of stuff
And that includes forty-four ounce cups

Styrofoam
I fill it half way up with Diet Coke
And top it off with brown liquor
Now, I'll walk down Main Street and catch me a buzz
Right up underneath the nose of the fuzz 'cause of
Styrofoam
You gotta love styrofoam
I know I do

Some folks say, "Hey, what about Mother Nature?
It decomposes so slow"
I'm no scientist, all I know is this
Beer I'm drinkin' is so cold
Thanks to

Styrofoam
Styrofoam
Styrofoam

So thank you, Ray McEntire
Thank you, Carl Munters
And thanks, Steve (Steve)
The guy at the Kwik Sak
Styrofoam
Styrofoam
