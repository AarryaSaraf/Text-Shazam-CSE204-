// Eternal Rains Will Come //

Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there's no time for us
Take comfort in what was

So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
When the flood comes to drown us
There's nothing we can do

Here it comes
Our death comes
And in my sleep
I can't forget

Reaching for the surface, I see you

// Cusp Of Eternity //

Child of autumn was born
To a world of deceit and then a land of lies
Break her bonds would take her away
The stars that stands are lost in eternal sorrow

Ah...

She walks across the country
She holds her hand up high in the rain
Mother was screaming for help
She turns around to stare at a scene from her memory

Ah...

She sighing, wishing her heart
Flew through a flap of wings that's come from a dream
That someone is waiting to see her name
Coming to inside at the cusp of eternity

Ah...

// Moon Above, Sun Below //

You are sleeping unhampered by guilt
Comes the morning you shut down
The devil's breath is a disease on your lips
Reaching out for your loss
You prey on your flock

Seeking out the weaker hearts
With eternity in your grip
And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion
They will eat from your head

With the moon above and the sun below

I can't remember the sun upon my skin
Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within
I'm always waiting for you before I sleep
There is no comfort in the distance that we keep

In a river of grief I am drowning
And your grip is surrounding my heart
Balancing on the edge of failure
And relieved, should I fall
Scattered dust upon my eyes
A winding road taking you nowhere
A winding road taking me home
And my home is my grave

Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say

Voices of despair is a familiar friendship
A society in your head holds the code to destruction

Dying fast
Summer dying fast
And this can't last, as nothing ever lasts
In a forest of flesh
There is a need to sever myself away from happiness

Still no drifting sun
Black upon the earth
Still the air is dry
And the locust wait

There is no help in the wake of our needs
There is no help to dispel the pain
There is no help yet some cling to a phantom
There is no help, only circles on the water

Only circles on the water

// Elysian Woes //

What is left when the morning comes
Is the memory of a future
And when my plight is done
There is nothing left to hold onto

There were friends waiting at my door
They are gone now, for the year is new
I stuck by my word
And when the rains came
Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt

Are we nursing destruction?
Pursuing a dream we once had
Was it our intention
to follow this road 'til the end
Even if the end is a world of sorrow?

There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable
So I come for you always
And I welcome pain
For a second of belonging somewhere
There were times when I lost my way
With hope pouring from my soul
In a shelter from the sun
I don't want to bare my scars for you

// River //

Show me a sign of troubles in your heart
Spare me your lies and tell me that you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care

And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away

In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives

// Voice Of Treason //

The mist is sleeping on the water
And winter is hiding in my heart
Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down
I can't pass through to the other side
She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers: "you've seen darkness before"
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?

Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?

// Faith In Others //

The grave of our youth is up ahead
And life has become a burden
We move in circles of suppressed despair
Waiting for the sun
And turning stones to find evidence
But it hides in the recesses of our hearts

A written decree of our loss
And we carried no faith in the cross
And the cold years are coming
For the victims of a longing

Out through the doors of starvation
And into the rains of damnation
Where the bitter winds are singing
For the victims of a longing

We carried along through squalor
With an inborn need to dominate and possess
It gives birth to an anger inside
And we can't control this
The blood of departure in our tracks
Dripping from our emptying vessels
Your hand reached out to hold mine
But you're grasping melting ice

Asleep in the rain
A child once again
And the ghost in my head
Has forgiven me

Lifted his curse upon me
