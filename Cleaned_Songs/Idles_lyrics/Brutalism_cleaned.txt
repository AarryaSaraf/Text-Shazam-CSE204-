Album: Brutalism

// Heel / Heal //

I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum

I'm done

I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum

I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm done

I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum

I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm fun

I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum

Ah
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun

I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum

I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm fun

Sexual violence doesn't start and end with rape
It starts in our books and behind our school gates
Men are scared women will laugh in their face
Whereas women are scared it's their lives men will take

Patience
I've got no goddamn patience
But I tried to shake shake shake it up
But I shook myself to boredom

Best friend
I do not like your best friend
And all those shades of grey-ah
They turn my blood so cold cold cold cold!

When it comes around
We barely scream or shout
Or rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

No no no you don't
Not a-fucking-gain
With your rhyme and your reason
And your cause

Shepherd
You want to be a shepherd
Well good for you
Go ahead
Your life won't be so tepid

But when it comes around
We barely scream or shout
And rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black
Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black

I'm from the migrant crew
I don't live in a menagerie
I don't give a fuck about me or you

'Cause I'm so cold
I'm so cold

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we

Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no

// Faith In The City //

I got a job in the city
1, 2, 3, 4

There's no god in the city
Uncle Noel's got cancer in his brain
Uncle Noel's got cancer in his lungs and his brain
I thought it would tear that man apart
Luckily, uncle Noel's got Jesus in his heart

I'm an Aquarius
1, 2, 3, 4

Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Hey

There's no jobs in the city
Mike lost 116 months
Allegedly all because of Benedictine monks
Bucky couldn't help him find a job
Luckily Mikey found himself at peace with God

I'm evangelical
1, 2, 3, 4

Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)

// 1049 Gotho //

My friend is so depressed
He wishes he was dead
I swam inside his head
And this is what he said

Help me
Help me
Won't someone set me free?
There's no right side of the bed
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

My friend is so depressed
She wanted to have sex
I pissed in the kitchen sink
As she slowly undressed

No way
No way
We never shall decay
We won't last five fucking minutes
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

I guess this is as far as she goes
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far

My friend is so depressed
He wishes he was dead
I swam inside his head
And this is what he said

Help me
Help me
Won't someone help me sleep?
There's no right side of the bed
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

My friend is so depressed
She wanted to have sex
I pissed in the kitchen sink
As she slowly undressed

No way
No way
We never shall decay
We won't last five fucking minutes
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

I guess this is as far as she goes
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go

Yeah-ee, yeah-ee, yeah-ee, yeah
Yeah-ee, yeah-ee, yeah
Yeah-ee, yeah-ee, yeah
Yeah-ee, yeah-ee, yeah

I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go

My friend is so depressed

No tact, breaking backs
You ain't their problem if you're not paying tax
Run it over, be cool
You ain't their problem if you never went to school
I'm shaking fast
Whip crack whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and dear dear wine

Rachel Khoo
Rachel Khoo
Let's drink to the summer time until we turn blue
I'll tear down every wall of a C.A.R.A.V.A.G.G.I.O
Just for you
It's true it's true
Whip crack, whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Deal drugs and cheap cheap wine

Let's go

My old man's a dustman
He's a sculptor by his trade
He always wears the trousers
And he carves with a hardy spade
We're sinking fast
Whip crack, whip crack, whip crack, whip crack, whip crack, whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and good ol' good ol' wine

// Stendhal Syndrome //

Did you see that painting what Rothko did?
Looks like it was painted by a two year old kid

Hot air
Hot air

Ignorance is bliss, yeah?
Well I'm not pleased
Because you spread your opinion like a wretched disease

Hot air
Hot air

Did you see that photo what Billingham took?
He needs to take a leaf out the screensaver book

Hot air
Hot air

If all photos were as you wanted them to be
There would be page three as far as the eye could see

Hot air
Hot air

Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love
Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love

Did you see that selfie what Francis Bacon did?
Don't look nothing like him, what a fucking div

Hot air
Hot air

Did you see that pink thing what Basquiat done?
Looks like it was drawn by my four year-old son

Hot air
Hot air

Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love
Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love

Here he is somehow
Oh, here he is somehow
Hey!

"Ah sure, see Mark, he'sâ€” he's got one of them fuckin' [?]... he's the future."

Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens

It seems like no one cares
I think I'll take the stairs
'Cause nothing ever

He punched himself in the face
To prove he wasn't gay
'Cause nothing ever happens

Over and over and over and over again
Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens

I dropped onto my knees
And prayed to Jesus please
Will something fucking happen

Then they killed poor George dead
They put a hammer through his head
Now nothing ever happens

Over and over and over and over again
Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens

// Benzocaine //

Oh Benzocaine

I think it's a crime
That when you look in your baby's eyes
You won't see mine
You won't see mine

The memories will stay
The brain will start to fade
Boredom creeps in jade
With God on Benzocaine

Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine

Chalk white
Gobshite
Bleeding gums
I thought the Benzocaine was supposed to numb
Supposed to numb
Supposed to numb
Supposed to numb

Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine

How many optimists does it take to change a lightbulb?
None!
Their butler changes the lightbulb

Always poor
Never bored

The S.L.C. want Timmy's student loan back
He'd happily oblige but he's used it all on gak

Always poor
Never bored

One miscarriage
Two abortions
One degree
Seven jobs
Sally danced her socks off as Jesus sobbed

Always poor
Never bored

I could've danced with another
'Cause she passed out on your stairs

Always poor
Never bored

Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing

Compensate with humour
Or if really bored then sing

Always poor
Never bored

Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing

Compensate with humour
Or if really bored then sing

Always poor
Never bored

// Slow Savage //

It was dark and cold as a knife when we tussled through the pines
You can howl at the bed sheets
Scream at the moon if you like
But it won't help me some, won't help me if we die
But it might help me some, might help me if you cry
She said, "Wait! We'll be better if we wait, better if we wait"
I said, "There's no amount of time to carry the weight"

La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai

'Cause I'm the worst lover you've ever had
I'm the worst lover you'll ever have

For two years in a row I forgot your birthday
For two years in a row I thought it was a Thursday

Maybe it was God
Maybe it was coke
Maybe I'm a drunk
I don't know
But at least now I remember your birthday

'Cause I'm the worst lover you'll ever have
Hands down, goddamn worst lover you'll ever have

La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai

'Cause I'm the worst lover you'll ever have
I'm the worst lover you'll ever have
