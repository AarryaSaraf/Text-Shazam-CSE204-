// War //

Wa-ching!
That's the sound of the sword going in
Clack-clack, clack-a-clang clang!
That's the sound of the gun going bang-bang
Tukka-tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk-tukka
That's the sound of the drone button pusher
Shh, shhh, shhh!
That's the sound of the children tooker

Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)

This means war!
Anti-war!
WAR!
This means war!
Anti-war!
Anti-war!

Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
Send Johnny into open fire
Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
We're gunning for the stone-faced liars
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
Send Sally into open fire
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
We're gunning for the stone-faced liars

And we're all going straight to hell

// Grounds //

You will not catch me staring at the sun
Not sucking on a dum dum, not turning round to run
No Hallelujahs and no kingdom comes
So you will not catch me staring at the sun
Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers
Fee fee fi fi fo fo fum
I smell the blood of a million sons
A million daughters from a hundred thousand guns
Not taught by our teachers on our curriculum

Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers
I am I
Unify

Not a single thing has ever been mended
By you standing there and saying you're offended
Go ahead, tell them what I've intended
I'll say what I mean, do what I love and fucking send it
Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers
There's nothing brave and nothing useful
You scrawling your aggro shit on the walls of the cubicle
Saying my race and class ain't suitable
So I raise my pink fist and say black is beautiful

Do you hear that thunder?
That's the sound of strength in numbers
I am I
Unify
I am I
Unify, unify, unify
Do you hear that thunder?

// Mr. Motivator //

Repeat after me

I am I and I intend to go, go, go
Like Conor McGregor with a samurai sword on rollerblades
Like Vasily Lomachenko after four pints of Gatorade
Like Kathleen Hanna with bear claws grabbing Trump by the pussy
Like Delia Smith after ten chardonnays making me a nice cookie

How'd you like them cliches?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
Yes you can
Woo-hoo!

I am I and I intend to go, go, go
Like a Frida Kahlo painting of the poor on your fuck off wall
Like Tracey Emin in her unmade bed listening to The Fall
Like Flava Flav in the club riding on the back of John Wayne
Like David Attenborough clubbing seal clubbers with LeBron James

How'd you like them cliches?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Woo!

It's all about the confidence
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it

// Anxiety //

My girlfriend just dumped me
For Friday night TV
And a boy who's six-foot-three
She hates me
I fixed the numb, but the numb don't fix
Now I fixed and I just feel sick
Sick sick, I feel kicks
But the kicks don't kick so I act a prick

I've got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety

Our government hates the poor
Cold leaders, cold class war
Given drugs you can't afford
So the poor can't buy the cure
Car crash country, car crash scene
Car crash dislocated knee
Car crash tabloid guillotine
Car crash cash for the bones you see

I have got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety
Anxiety
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)

// Kill Them With Kindness //

"Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!", said the puppy to the snake
I've got a real big mirror of a smile and I hold it to the fakes
Hard boot sound to the ground so I see what shakes

And I'll kill them with kindness
I'll kill them with kindness
Ain't no dormouse here

It doesn't mean you have to bow, or say "Your Highness"
Just kill them with kindness
If you wanna beat the machine, keep your teeth clean

And kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kindness

I guess you cannot tell from my tone, I mean ba-ba-business and I ain't on my own
I'm guessing it is hard for you to see, that-that-that-that empathy will cut down your throne
Don't you mind people grinning in your face, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, set the champ to the chase
Woo

'Cause you'll kill them with kindness (kill them with kindness)

Your hum-drum, sarky slow lines don't bother me none
"Wa-wa-wa, woo-woo-woo" said the flower to the sun
Our love-locked congregation gift will get you slapped
"Na na na na na gnaw", said the beaver to the dam

'Cause we're killing with kindness
Killing with kindness
We're killing with kindness

Woo!
Ay ya ya ya ya ya ya ya there ain't no dormouse here

// Model Village //

A lot of nine-fingered boys in the village
They haven't got much choice in the village (Yeah)
Model car, model wife, model village
Model far, model right, model village
They ain't too friendly in the village (In the village)
There's a tabloid frenzy in the village (Don't read The Sun)
He's "not a racist but" in the village
Gotta drive half-cut in the village
Model low crime rate in the village
Model race, model hate, model village (Village)
Got my head kicked in in the village (Wah)
There's a lot of pink skin in the village
"Hardest man in the world" in the village
He says he got with every girl in the village

Take flight, take flight
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Model village

I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death

(Yeah, I'm a fuckin' dragon)
Still not in love with the village
Homophobes by the tonne in the village
A lot of overpriced drugs in the village
A lot of half-pint thugs in the village
Model car, model wife, model village
Model far, model right, model village (Model village)
I see a lot of gammon in the village (Hey)
I don't see a lot happen in the village (Nothing happens)
Just give them an anthem and they'll sing it
Still they don't know the meanings in it (Meanings in it)
Just saluting flags 'cause it's British
Idiot spirits think they're kindred
Model low crime rate in the village (In the village)
Model race, model hate, model village
It feels like the village is self-pillaged
Still someone's making a killing

Take flight, take flight
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Take flight
Model village

I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death
I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death

You gotta laugh as the curtain twitches
And the villagers bury their riches
But the village doesn't know what rich is
Just snitches snitchin' on snitches
Only one thing to do in the village
Just say toodle-do to the village
Toodle-fucking-do

// Ne Touche Pas Moi //

This is a sawn-off
For the cat-callers
This is a pistol
For the wolf whistle
'Cause your body is your body
And it belongs to nobody but you
But you

Ne touche pas moi
This is my dance space
Ne touche pas moi
This is your dance space
Ne touche pas moi
This is my dance space
Ne touche pas moi
Consent!
Consent!
Consent!

This is a sawn-off
For the cat-callers
This is a pistol
For the wolf whistle
'Cause my body is my body
And it belongs to nobody but me
But me

Ne touche pas moi
This is my dance space
Ne touche pas moi
This is your dance space
Ne touche pas moi
This is my dance space
Ne touche pas moi
Consent!
Consent!
Consent!
Consent!
Consent!
Ne touche pas moi
This is your dance space
Ne touche pas moi
This is your dance space
Ne touche pas moi

// Carcinogenic //

Run the people down to the bone on their knees
9-to-5 every day of the week is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)
There's a minimum wage, whilst your boss takes a raise
He lies through his brand new teeth, he is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)
Over-working, working nurses and teachers
While you preach austerity is...
Carcinogenic (carcinogenic)

You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can

Cramming people into high-rises, while selling their welfare for low prices
Public spending gets big slices, while ignoring the true crisis
Where were you when the ship sank?
Probably not queuing for food banks
Probably waving your Union Jack
Probably rallying for new tanks
Probably to blow up the ice caps
Because the lunatics have taken over the asylum
Ah-ahhh

You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can

Methamphetamine, crack and heroin and living a life on tik is...
Carcinogenic!
Ten pints of G, Mad Dog 20-20, two packs of Bucky and some boozey-oozey is...
Carcinogenic!
Class division and bear-baiting on television for better ratings is...

You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can
You only die once
You'll never come back
You're gone when you're gone
So, love what you can

// Reigns //

How does it feel to have blue blood coursing through your veins?
How does it feel to have blue blood coursing through your veins?
How does it feel to have blue blood coursing through your veins?
How does it feel to have blue blood coursing through your veins?
Huh?!

Pull on my reigns
Pull on my reigns

How does it feel to have shanked the working classes into dust?
How does it feel to have shanked the working classes into dust?
How does it feel to have won the war that nobody wants?
How does it feel to have won the war that nobody wants?
Huh?!

Pull on my reigns
Pull on my reigns
Pull on my reigns
Pull on my reigns

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

// The Lover //

There's a feeling washing over me
It was built by you and me
Our unity makes me feel so free to say...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"
I feel the feeling and the feeling's pure
I gotta feeling I ain't scared no more
Because my people love me make me feel sure to say...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?

Look Ma, I'm a soul singer
Singing in the faces of the middle finger
So, I bite my thumb and let it linger
To say, "fuck you, I'm a lover"
If I don't like the music you fake
I just won't listen to the piss you take, 'cause
Sycophants is not a good band make and...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"
You say you don't like my clichés
Our sloganeering and our catchphrase
I say, "love is like a freeway" and...
"Fuck you, I'm a lover"

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it feel good?

I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
I want to cater for the haters
Eat shit
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!
Eat shit!

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da don't it taste good?

// A Hymn //

I want to be loved
Everybody does
I find shame in the crack-like corpse un-cadaver reign
I want to be loved
Everybody does
I find shame gripped tight like your withering fame
We made it
Shame

Hot Zumba classes at the new church
I lost ten pounds for the wedding
I played happy til my teeth hurt
Sofa surfer extraordinaire
Lambert's ash in my falling hair, yeh

I want to be loved
Everybody does
I find shame cuts rips real nice as we change lanes
We made it
I want to be loved
Everybody does
We made it
We made it

Shame

Teletext has a place in my heart
Ten percent discount, I'll show you how
Gregory's birthday in a placid town, wow
Janine held the flag with white knuckles
I'm burning the Astra til the wheels buckle, yeh

I want to be loved
Everybody does

Shame
Shame
