// Damaged Goods //

The change will do you good
I always knew it would

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The sins of flesh
Are simply sins of lust
Sweat's running down your back
Sweat's running down your neck
Heated couplings in the sun (Or is that untrue?)
Colder couplings in the night (Never saw your body)
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good
Damaged goods

Send 'em back
I can't work, I can't achieve
Send em back
Open the till,
Give me the change you said would do me good
You said you're cheap but you're so smart
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

// Horizon //

Let me put the water in the bowl
For your wounds, babe
Let me fill you up with the fingers of love
You can't lose babe
When you watch me play, does it feel bad, darlin'
When they choose me?
Say again, this place
Say again, this place

I broke my neck
Dancing to the edge of the world, babe
My mouth is wet, don't you forget it
Don't you lose me
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon

I broke my neck
Dancing to the edge of the world, babe
My mouth is wet, don't you forget it
Don't you lose me
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon

I've gotta scratch it down, I never could amount
That's it, babe
And now the sugar's run out
And I don't know what to say
Say again, this place
Say again, this place
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon

And every now and then, I think about
When you'll die, babe
There's a fall in my head
It floods what you said into the room, babe
I don't belong in the desert
Yes, I can see it, take me home, babe
Say again, this place
Say again, this place
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon

Here is your princess
And here is the horizon
Here is your princess
And here is the horizon

// I Dream Guillotine //

My jaded visions of a
Jaded city broken
By a jaded wealthy jettison
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

Put your children in a chokehold
Put the poor in a chokehold
There's no such thing as a broken home
There's no such thing as a broken home

Tell that to the front line
The bread line, the welfare line
The factory line, the factory line
The factory line, the factory line

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me where we'll end
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead

My bastard visions of a
Bastard city broken
By a bastard wealthy jettison
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

Put the children in a chokehold
Put the poor in a chokehold
There's no such thing as a broken home
There's no such thing as a broken home

Tell that to the front line
The bread line, the welfare line
The lottery line, the lottery line
The lottery line, the lottery line

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me when we're fed
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead

All aboard
All aboard
All aboard
All aboard

All aboard the cocaine ghost train
All aboard the cocaine ghost train
All aboard the cocaine ghost train
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me when we're fed
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead

// Mercedes Marxist //

Forgive my crippled head
Our revolution's dead
They've gambled all our pride
They want money instead
They've gone and speared my side
I think they want me dead

Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what he said
Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what she said
Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what I said
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check what I said
Chuck, chuck, chuck, check, check, check, chick, chick, chick, chick what she said

"Suicide's for cowards", he said
Whilst sat drinking himself to death

I'd bow on my knees for you
But I'm already wasted
I'd wait at the gates for you
But I'm already wasted
I'd bow on my knees for you
But I'm already wasted

Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out

Forgive my crippled head
Our revolution's dead

// Model Village (Remix) //

A lot of nine-fingered boys in the village
They haven't got much choice in the village
Model car, model wife, model village (Nice car)
Model far, model right, model village
A lot of bad blood in the village (I fucking hate them)
Neighbourhood watch in the village
Model dog, model watch in the village
Model run, model tits and acrylics
Model low crime rate in the village
Model race, model hate, model village
He's "not a racist but" in the village
Gotta drive half-cut in the village
In the village, if you're black you ain't British (British)
In the village judge a man by our pigments
In the village it's all Chinese whispers
Everybody's nose in your business
Model village

I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death

Hahaha
Little boy (You scared mate?)
Come on stay up and be a fucking man

Model low crime rate in the village
Model race, model hate, model village (Village)
Model snowflake in the village (Cocaine)
Model day, model raise, model piss-head
Got my head kicked in in the village (Wah)
There's a lot of pink skin in the village
In the village made of glass, like your chin is
In the village we smoke fags, not ciggies
"Hardest man in the world" in the village
He says he got with every girl in the village
He said he was the slag of the village
Coke face take bags in the village
Still not in love with the village
Homophobes by the tonne in the village
In the village, yeah they got a lot of spirit
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make em' drink it
Model village (Model fucking village)

I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death
I beg your pardon
I don't care about your rose garden
I'm listenin' to the things you said
You just sound like you're scared to death

You gotta laugh as the curtain twitches
And the villagers bury their riches
But the village doesn't know what rich is
Just snitches snitchin' on snitches
Only one thing to do in the village
Just say toodle-do to the village
Toodle-fucking-do

// Sodium //

I feel like I understand
How it feels to kill a man
Sure fire I retire your plans
Tastes like metal

Tendon piercing like a dog
Elbow teeth crack feels like God
Shake your money maker
Tastes like metal

Kni-kni-kni-kni-knives out
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying

They say fame is a hell of a drug
Until they peel the wings of a dove
It's a losing streak I'm on
Tastes like metal

Hear the bells, they ring for you
You can run but I'll run too
Dark light shine bright like a blood sheen
Tastes like metal

Kni-kni-kni-kni-knives out
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying

// The God That Failed //

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
The god that failed

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed
