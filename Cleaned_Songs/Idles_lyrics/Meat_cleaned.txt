Album: Meat

// Queens //

Covered in blood
He was there for the taking
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Dancing on the city
Walls we were breaking
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Indigenous Children
Littered the streets
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Contorted and wasted
While we eat for free
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Parading around
Some Buddhist temple
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
I saw a man
Sat doused in petrol
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Caked in Vigour
And colours of pride
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
The smell of victory
Blows my mind

QUEENS
Stop taking photos of yourself

I dream about
Burying you in a forest
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
If I were you
I wouldn't wait for the chorus
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
I've seen your face
A thousand times
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Ignorant smiles
A mile wide
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
No one loves you
I can tell
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
As you spill your guts
In personal hell

QUEENS
Stop taking photos of yourself
Stop taking photos of yourself

Well heaven knows
Who will help you now
So take some photos
If you're hanging 'round
If I had my way
You would see what for
You would see me waiting
From the Ocean floor

Well heaven knows
Who will help you now
So take some photos
If you're hanging 'round

// Romantic Gestures //

Death by chocolate
Atlantic salt
Take my heart
And the flowers I stole

Sunday morning
Kurosawa
You
Are
Beautiful
You
Are
Beautiful

It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If I recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying

It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If I recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you

We danced to Stagger Lee
In the moonlight
Draped in gold
We dance to exploding boy
Like we were five years old

I will sack all my friends off
Pretend I like Elvis
I won't do those things
You could colour me selfish

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying

// Nice Man //

Gotta' take drugs if you want to win
Gotta' make love if you want a kiss
Get it when you're on your own
So you buy a new telephone

Hallelujah, he's wearing thin
Even the blind can see through him
Lucid cracks in the dream
Bruises into the scene

Defecated freedoms
And overusing the word
You will always see him
For what your heart would prefer

Rage
Takes time
The way my heart
It bleeds straight in
It bleeds straight in

Gotta' shout loud if you want to know
Gotta' break bones if it's not enough
Always part of the game
Pulling heart strings to maim

Is that what you will tell your kids?
He's only violent when he's wasted
Maybe he's just insecure?
Maybe he'll beat up for cure

Defecated freedoms
And overusing the word
You will always see him
For what your heart would prefer

Rage
Takes time
The way my heart
It bleeds straight in
It bleeds straight in

Rage
Takes time

I know you don't care
I tear apart my soul
I tear apart my soul

Down
Down
Down
Down
