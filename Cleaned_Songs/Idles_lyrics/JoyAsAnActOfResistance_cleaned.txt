[Part I]

I was done in on the weekend
The weekend lasted twenty years
The world's best bulimic bartend
Tender, violent and queer

Forgive me father, I have sinned
I've drained my body full of pins
I've danced til dawn with splintered shins
Full of pins, full of pins

Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

They laugh at me when I run
I waste away for fun
I am my father's son
His shadow weighs a tonne

Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

They laugh at me when I run
I waste away for fun
I am my father's son
His shadow weighs a tonne

Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

Forgive me father, I have sinned
I've drained my body full of pins
I've danced till dawn with splintered shins
Full of pins, full of pins

Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Go go go go go go!

It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming

[Part II]

I don't want to be your man, your man
I don't want to be your man, your man

I'm like Stone Cold Steve Austin
I put homophobes in coffins

I'm like Fred Astaire
I dance like I don't care

I'm like Ted DiBiase
I win no matter what it costs me

I'm like Evel Knievel
I break bones for my people

I'm on my best behavior
Like Jesus Christ our savior

I'm like Reggie Kray

// Never Fight A Man With A Perm //

Brylcreem
Creatine
And a bag of Charlie Sheen
Brylcreem
Creatine
And a bag of cocaine
A dulcet man with a dolcet tone
From a dulcet town and a dolcet home
He hates me
I like that
Two arms like big baseball bats
I bark
He bites back
A jaw like a fuck off bear trap
He said "these boots are made for stomping
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna
Stomp all over you."

I said I got a penchant for smokes and kicking douches in the mouth
Sadly for you my last cigarette's gone out

Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete

A heathen from Eton
On a bag of Michael Keaton
A heathen from Eton
On a bag of Michael Keaton
He thinks he's suave
You're not suave 'cause you watched Get Carter
You are a catalogue, plastic Sinatra
A tryhard, you should've tried harder
Me, oh me, oh my, Roy
You look like a walking thyroid
You're not a man, you're a gland
You're one big neck with sausage hands
You are a Topshop tyrant
Even your haircut's violent
You look like you're from Love Island
You stood and the room went silent

Never fight a man with a perm

Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete and leather
Concrete

I shut my mouth
Let's hug it out
I shut my mouth
Let's hug it out
I shut my mouth
I shut my mouth

// I'm Scum //

I'm council housed and violent
I'm laughing at the tyrants
I'm sleeping under sirens
Whilst wondering where the time went
I'm scum
I'm scum
I'll sing at fascists 'til my head comes off
I am Dennis Skinner's molotov
I'm lefty, I'm soft
I'm minimum wage job
I am a mongrel dog
I'm just another cog
I'm scum
I'm scum

This snowflake's an avalanche

Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long long while I'm known as
Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long old while I'm known as scum
I'm scum

Spit in your percolator
I am procrastinator
I over-tip the waiter
Sarcastic computator
'Cause I'm scum
I'm scum
I don't care about the next James Bond
He kills for country, queen and god
We don't need another murderous toff
I'm just wondering where the high street's gone
'Cause I'm scum
I'm scum

This snowflake's an avalanche

Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long long while I'm known as
Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum

My blood brother is an immigrant
A beautiful immigrant
My blood brother's Freddie Mercury
A Nigerian mother of three

He's made of bones, he's made of blood
He's made of flesh, he's made of love

// Love Song //

I wrote a love song
'Cause you're so loveable
I carried a watermelon
I want to be vulnerable

I will not go to bars
Or jump in strangers' cars
Or mine sweep for wines
And lines and lines and lines
It's not about the sex and sex and sex and sex and sex and sex
I want to be your best ever friend
Forever best friend

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)

I fucking love you
I really love you
Look at the card I bought
It says "I love you"

You try and you try and you try and you try
To make me change
I hope and I pray and I pray and I pray
You'll stay the same
I wish-ish-ish-ish-ish
I wish you'll always stay
So I push-ush-ush-ush-ush
I push you away

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)

You give me power
You give me power
You're like a gun or a knife
Be my wife

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)

This modern love
Modern love
-dern love

Dreams can be so cruel sometimes
I swear I kissed your crying eyes
Dreams can be so cruel sometimes
I swear I kissed your crying eyes

A stillborn but still born
I am a father
A stillborn but still born
I am a father

Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, just lie
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls

The mask of masculinity
Is a mask, a mask that's wearing me
The mask, the mask, the mask

I'm a real boy, boy, and I cry
I love myself and I want to try
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father

Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, just lie
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls

The mask of masculinity
Is a mask, a mask that's wearing me
The mask, the mask, the mask

I'm a real boy, boy and I cry
I love myself and I want to try
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father

I kissed a boy and I liked it
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
This is why, this is why, this is why
This is why, this is why, this is why

// Television //

If someone talked to you
The way you do to you
I'd put their teeth through
Love yourself
And that's what they do
The bastards made you
Not want to look like you
So you pay through the nose
To look like someone else
All the weirdos on the shelf
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself

I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV

If someone talked to you
The way you do to you
I'd put their teeth through
Love yourself
And that's what they do
The bastards made you
Not want to look like you
So you pay through the nose
To look like someone else
All the weirdos on the shelf
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself

I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV

I spoke to God in my dreams last night
She said I'd go to heaven if my teeth was white
Medicator, medicator, medicator
Numb me from these naysayers
And their crocodile feels
And their crocodile love
And their crocodile tears

I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
And the magazines
Television and magazines
Television and magazines
Television and magazines

// Great //

(Listen to more Jungle)
Blighty wants his country back
Fifty-inch screen in his cul-de-sac
Wombic charm of the Union Jack
As he cries at the price of a bacon bap

Islam didn't eat your hamster
Change isn't a crime
So won't you take my hand sir
And sing with me in time

G R E A T
G R E A T

Blighty wants her blue passport
Not quite sure what the union's for
Burning bridges and closing doors
Not sure what she sees on the seashore

Islam didn't eat your hamster
Change isn't a crime
So won't you take my hand sister
And sing with me in time

G R E A T
G R E A T

You can have it all, I don't mind
Just get ready to work overtime

'Cause we're all in this together

// Cry To Me //

When someone
Leaves you all alone
And nobody
Calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Well here I am, boy
Cry to me

When you're all alone
In your lonely room
And there's nothing
But the smell of perfume
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
C'mon, cry to me
Cry to me

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, it just a waste of time
C'mon
When your heart beats, pounding like a rabbit's in the night
I'll hold you
And tell you everything's alright

Cry to me
Cry, cry to me
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry to me
Cry to me
Cry to me
Cry, cry, cry to me

// Rottweiler //

There's a snake in my boots
There's a rat in my cage
There's a shark at my feet
That's been circling for days

There's a vulture at my breakfast table
People think I'm insane

There's a snake in my boots
There's a rat in my cage
There's a shark at my feet
That's been circling for days and days

There's a vulture at my breakfast table
People think I'm insane
There's a ghost in my bed
There's milk in my coffee

Destroy the world!
Burn your house down!
