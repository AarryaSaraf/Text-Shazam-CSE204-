// You Without End //

[Nadia Kury:]
"He pained, shifting his attention toward the mirror across the road. Back into his daydream. The spliff burned his fingers the second he drank, and he tossed it toward the gutter. The smoke burned into his eyes, blinding him. As he blinked through the tears, the pain began to recede. Back down the promenade and homeward bound, as he approached the intersection of Brooklyn and Lakeshore, a flock of geese burst from the darkness and flew, shrieking into what was left of the daylight."

In a dark tunnel
And new dawn approaching
With a sphere of light
Ever glowing

And then the world will know
Will know of you
Of all things love
Of all things true

[Nadia Kury:]
"He looked up to watch them form a ghostly shoggoth with flashes of white from their exposed chest, blinking like so many eyes. Crossing the street drenched him in fluorescent light, and he quickened his pace until he reached the softer light of the street."

Let it go as it grows on forever
And let it go
Let it go as it grows
Breathe it in
Let it go as it grows on forever
And we breathe it in
And we breathe it in

And then the world will grow
And then the world will grow
And then the world will know
Of all true love, true

// Honeycomb //

Shadows extend east
And Cortazar stares at women shuffling by who blot their lips from violent men
And say "god bless you"
I sulk with pause and
Loving mariachi soars against the red and yellow tents of strangers
Gifting geese the ends of bread
8, 12, 13 hours and the people keep fighting for sleep, for rest...

I'm reluctant to stay sad life
Beyond is a field a flowers
My love is a nervous child lapping from the glowing lagoon of their presence
My love is a bulging, blue-faced fool hung from the throat by sunflower stems

// Canary Yellow //

Staring out onto the earthly pottery of existence
Climbing light vines to heaven
Clay ribbons descend
Swirl downward against metallic swell
Go sail charmer, altruist
Who immersed in thickets
Hugged in cloth
Evolves into charcoal
Is worshipped by the drifting macaw
The lady finch
They swoop and croon through the air
Dip their feathers in the death paste of ash water

I have wondered about the language of flowers
And you, elaborate mosaic, greeting me
Gentle, the swamp takes my ankles
On and on we choke on an everlasting
Handsome night
My lover's blood rushes right through me
Wild, fantastic

// Near //

Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Can I rest for awhile?
Wishing you were near

Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Thought I saw you there
Wishing you were near
Can I rest for awhile?
Wishing you were near

// Glint //

Listening to muffled footsteps
Of those brushing
Reaching grasses
Seeing the last letters of my name
Seeing the last letters of my name
Faded and shy
Imagining us clasping hands in holiday

Imagining us clasping hands in holiday
Imagining you growing older
Growing somehow more beautiful

Imagining you growing older
Somehow more beautiful
Surrounded by your children
And children's
Children
The midnight blue
The midnight blue of your calmness
Evening chamomile

Surrounded by
All your children's children

The midnight blue
Of your calmness
Evening chamomile

Eyes as a morning rosewater
Eyes as a morning rosewater

I'm

I'm shrinking into your gown
Tearing the pink linen of your belly
Burying into your abdomen
And sewing the seam of your skin

I'm

I'm shrinking into your gown
Tearing the pink linen of your belly
Burying into your abdomen
And sewing the seam of your skin

Crawl

// Night People //

Biblical sky speckled with flame
Do you hold your mother's eyes
From wetting the earth?
From weeping for those
Who reward fame to absolutes of war?

Or for heroic myths
Provided to children
Married into ferocity?
They instead witness themselves

And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body

I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side

I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side

I spied along the concrete canvas
A woman, her eyes brimming with vacancy
And bear her hugging barbiturates
Her head rolled from faint shoulders
And skipped three times
Each thud sprouting a fountain
Of splashing gold

// Worthless Animal //

With all life profane
The ladles cradling
Streams of buttermilk
Current stretch out
And alabaster lips unseal

So I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still

Alabaster lips unseal
So I may recall
I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still

Now

When a fawn
Stumbles into the road
Honeydew high
And deep in afterglow
Mind swarming
Mind small
Honeydew high
Transforming the soul

On purple sand verbena
I forgive its delusion
Caress its world view
Super bloom
Shelter canary yellow eyes

Then search to pin the legs
Of the stalking dog
That lends its teeth
To sticky, sad bedlam
War cries quake through lurching light

I bury a blade between its ribs
Bear hug the soft canine frame
Then smear ash
Then smear the ash on its brow

All who have forgotten
Remember now
Remember now
Now

Now
