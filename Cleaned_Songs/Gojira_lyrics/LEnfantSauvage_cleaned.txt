Album: LEnfantSauvage

// Explosia //

Jealously will crush you to the bones
Unless you open up and let it go
I've only seen too much of it
I'm bursting open while you set the tone

You ignored this fury too long, I explode
Bring back to life this anger, let it grow
Put aside mind traps and false beliefs
These heavy weights created pull you down

The mask you wear is falling
Try on and watch it fall
Hands down you feel the moment
Releasing out a lifetime

All prayers to these gods
While the tide is growing high
Will you make us stronger
When you strike us down?

// L'enfant Sauvage //

So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying
I don't know
The apparition of this world
I try to deal with

I've killed the part of me
That was raging
The pain is gone
The denial
I've run away from institutions
I owe myself
Life

There's no way
I will respond to this passion and anger
Flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage
Betray your child
The desire that you won't serve to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Anger
Lies
Denial

This righteous anger
Boiling inside of us
Won't last forever
Don't fear to let it out
Branches are coming through,
The wolf is the master

The sky is all over me
I run on time.

// The Axe //

I've been a victim to the blade against myself
Bloodletting all of my soul
Sucked in, paralyzed in this vortex
Reduced to silence
In the dark I've lingered to long
This sharpened axe, beam of light
I reach for and I master
Wield against these shadows

Its purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching, question if this light ends

Now I will strike and dig with precision
Introspective eye, erase the concept
I lost my fears and the notion of time
I healed my sorrow
All boundaries are illusion
When you reach the center of light
And reinforce the striking power
By chance you're followed

Its purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching, question if this light ends

All ghosts dwelling in, inside, in the heart
I see them all, release their shadows

// Liquid Fire //

Ejected from the womb, unrestrained, I'm catching the wind
Unfolded fire blows with the words, straight from within
The second I was born, I found a shelter deep in my own
I ventured further out on the edge of the glacier
This is how we talk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this alone, we bow to no one
Carved by the waves, our sacred temple
Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to an end now
Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight
Intelligence of heart as only guidance
Infinite power lies all around us and in the heart
The flashes find a way, stealing through these broken walls
And when this fire grows, it does it so we can remember
The meaning of this life, we'll be marching until the end

Had no taste for more lies, we are standing alone
The bright treasure we found has no price and no name
In the light of this star, with the forces aligned

This is how we talk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this alone, we bow to no one
Carved by the waves, our sacred temple
Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to an end now
Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight
Intelligence of the heart as only guidance

// Planned Obsolescence //

Created weakness for the numbers on the board
Absurd amount of things, obsolete creation
The lust for always more, indulgence in hunger
A greed for power, the demon needs to feed

From cradle you've been taught how to rule and conquer
The devil smiling, no isn't real
Black vultures in the mist approaching, now closer
The end is coming, we'll take it from there

A message goes to all the souls
To all those staying, face turned to the ground
You hold the key to infinite power
That has always been here and forever
Every time you step out, raise your voice
Resurrected from the ground

Designed for failure
Behold the waste is burnt to the ground
Face down and broken
We dedicated our essence to this game
No better time, let's dream on, wish for better
You're on an elevated sense of greater
These engines, power crushing down

One day we'll wake up from this absolute nonsense
A star worshiped will burn in the red
Disused and empty shell, icon of an old world
Conscience awakened, we'll take it from there

// Mouth Of Kala //

There's a river of time
Let us worship this god of destruction
On nothing we can rely
All is gone, belong to the past
You should learn by the time
Everything changing over and over
We're all falling so fast
Keep on burning

Overwhelming power
Keep on burning, change

The old me didn't survive
Inexorable transfiguration
There is something at war
This red tainted flash on the wall
I'm nowhere to be found
Nothing matters, truth out of sight
In the air I dissolve
I'm fading away

Overwhelming power
Keep on burning, change

// The Gift Of Guilt //

We leave the shores to see the mountains rising
A distant impression growing
This judgment creates the pain in we hold
Destructive intentions that serve no purpose
But the end of us all

These vultures from the past, coming
In all the hells and worlds, the time has come
Delivered from their eyes
Embrace, suffer, destroy - the gift of guilt

The shame and sorrow, self-condemnation
Fill all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding
Bestowed upon us, devastating power
We're building connective tissue to a maze of lies

We're left as starving orphans
The vital core is gone
Our sins are all over and over again we swallow
We're sick and tired when this wind blows
The reflex is insane
We must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love

These vultures from the past, coming
In all the hells and worlds, the time has come
Delivered from their eyes
I'm leaving this behind - the gift of guilt

// Pain Is A Master //

Crawling and moaning in the sharp blade of grass
All my life starting over, blood spilled inside out
I went through this cycle of pain deep in myself
Destroyed by awful hands, a demon of illusion

The pain now awaken, I'm cracking wide open
Can barely recognize my body, a battlefield
Unquestioned pride once so fragile
I cannot even recall names or faces
Those standing on my side

Those standing on my side, always
My side

I am nothing the pain awake is forging me
Face down, inert
Forcing me, dreams haunting me
I am immense, I am awake, renewed

Lost in the darkest time
I know I felt their presence
Even if I was blind
Face down I was blind
Pain, please forgive my ignorance
My master

// Born In Winter //

Before all things reborn again
You learn the painful breath of time
Cold mourning stretches out your arms
To the mighty warmth of the golden sun
Seems all have gone insane for gold
All was created out of the night
We're all born from the burst of a star

The day you'll come to life you'll realize
Expanding force to life where you belong
And in the winter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright

One day you'll walk the world and keep in mind
The heart you've been given in winter time
And through the bitter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright

// The Fall //

Leaves are falling, the wind is blowing so cold
The end, cycle, peel to the core

Vision faces disintegrator
It all came back to me
Non could be lower, crawling under
The weight I can't take
I eat all, wild and virgin
The world carries the tears
Again the glory collapsing in silence
I'll be counting the layers

And the millions of mirrors you're sending
Reflecting rays of sun in dark time
Greater spirits from above are watching
Let us drink those tears, may we grow strong
Sometimes in our love disappointed
Fool ourselves in blind pretension
Sever ties to the possible options
Destroy the bridges to the green land

Fall to the ground
All dies again

A circle of blood and power recycled
Greater visions awaits a new coming
Melting rocks on the lives hard-working
And all shall die, transform
Nothing left to steal, no rewarding
Competition over no cheating
This great opened eye under water
Is rising slowly, embrace all over

Fall to the ground
All dies again

Leaves are falling, the wind is blowing so cold
The end, cycle, peel to the core

// This Emptiness //

This spot of light in space attracted my inner sight
The loved ones are so close, they talk to me in dreams
Contact the core I once felt I need to restore
Drifted away, I'm not the same anymore
These idle hands, the tools of my darkness
Always the same, this fire burning

This emptiness I should fill, the evil I have to fix
This happiness I should reach, come back to me in dreams

Myself away so long, I've been refusing to feed
I always kept the flame, my will is to grow
Unfolded vision, a force is unveiled
It's all around me, from a void now explodes

Contact this force of light anytime
Time
These lies in me dwell no more
More

// My Last Creation //

The speed of the line was rending, my hands on blood
But I always grab on these darkened visions
And I try my best to avoid this poison

Amplifying the sounds from under
Horror vision increasing, they're crawling
So broken, twisted, I feel their grasp on me
Can I trust this night mare, kill me

You wield a secret so dark and cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures part of me insane
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation

Run for your life, like the wind, go, run
Leave behind the conflict, the load you carry
Don't fear the light of tomorrow
This fire will wipe them out forever

Sound underground, alive
I grow my soul wide inside
Grow

You wield a secret dark and so cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures a part of me insane
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation
