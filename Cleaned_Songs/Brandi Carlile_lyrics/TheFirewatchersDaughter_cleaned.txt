// Wherever Is Your Heart //

I think it's time we found a way back home
You lose so many things you love as you grow
I missed the days when I was just a kid
My fear became my shadow, I swear it did

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

You made me feel like I was always falling
Always falling down without a place to land
Somewhere in the distance I heard you calling
Oh it hurts so bad to let go of your hand

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

Even when you're high, you can get low
Even with your friends you love, you're still alone
We always find the darkest place to go
God forgive our minds, we were born to roam

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind
There's a road that's long and winding, it hollers home
I'm calling home

Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home
Oh God forgive my mind, oh God forgive my mind
When I come home, when I come home

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

// The Eye //

It really breaks my heart
To see a dear old friend
Go down to the worn out place again

Do you know the sound
Of a closing door?
Have you heard that sound somewhere before?

Do you wonder if she knows you anymore?

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye

Where did you learn to walk?
Where did you learn to run?
Away from everything you love

Did you think the bottle
Would ever ease your pain?
Did you think that love's a foolish game?

Did you find someone else to take the blame?

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye

I am a sturdy soul
And there ain't no shame
In lying down in the bed you made
Can you fight the urge to run for another day?

You might make it further if you learn to stay

I wrapped your love around me like a chain
But I never was afraid that it would die
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye
You can dance in a hurricane
But only if you're standing in the eye

// The Things I Regret //

Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh
Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh

There's a hole in my pocket where my dreams fell through,
from a side walk in the city to the avenue.
There's a leak in my dam 'bout the size of a pin,
and I can't quite remember where the water's getting in.

But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
all the things you regret,
you can only remember what you want to forget.
You feel it tugging at your heart,
like the stars overhead,
'til you rest your bones on the killing bed.

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you. 

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you.

With the weight of the world resting on my back,
and the road on which I've travelled is as long as it is cracked.
But I keep pressing forward with my feet to the ground,
for a heart that is broken makes a beautiful sound.

But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
all the things you regret,
you can only remember what you want to forget.

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you. 

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you.

Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh
Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh

I walk through my days like a ghost in a dream,
but the field carries on and my past follows me.
It's hard moving on from the things you done wrong,
when they play in your head like an old fashioned song.

But when you're wearing on your sleeve,
all the things you regret,
you can only remember what you want to forget.

Lonely miles,
without you.

Lonely miles,
without you.

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you. 

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me,
when I doubt you.

Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me.
Let them roll over me.

Let the ground keep my faults.
Let the water be my home.
Let the dust hold my soul,
like a holy rolling stone.

// Mainstream Kid //

I'm gonna to fit in
I'm on the list
I'm gonna to get in
Haven't you heard
Don't you know who I am
I'm with the Joneses
I'm their best friend

I came to saturate the market
To perpetuate the hip kid
I was born so I could fall in line
I'm a legend in my own mind
Can I blend in with your kind?

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

Your revolution
gets in the way of my confusion
I need someone to tell me who I am
To keep me under this illusion

I came to separate the classes
To place the fails above the passes
And there has never been a better time to set the bar beneath the masses
Can I blend in with your kind?

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

I need you to liberate me
You the masses educate me
Hold my fist into the air
Declare a social victory

You can own me, you control me
Individuality has never stood a chance against you
Jump into the mainstream

Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream
Your revolution
Into the mainstream kid
Your revolution
Into the mainstream

Jump into the mainstream kid

// Beginning To Feel The Years //

You carry me along with you
Keep my spirit strong you do
Maybe I was meant to be
under your lock and key

The hard times that I had
Really don't seem all that bad
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light

There are things that I've said before
I don't mean them anymore
Yesterday is long ago and far away

And I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light

With angels by your side
The spirit's there to guide

I'm beginning to feel the years
but I'm going to be ok
as long as you're beside me along the way
Going to make it through the night
and into the morning light

// Wilder (We're Chained) //

You came into this world with eyes as clear as water
You didn't look a thing like your grandmother's daughter
With a heart so heavy and beating like a drum
Yeah, neither did you look like your grandfather's son

We're chained, and when everything changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away, our love will still remain
We're chained

Wilder than a brushfire burns deep inside the bramble
Baby, I think God made your soul born to ramble
Maybe you'll take to the far away places
Where life is gonna deal you a hand full of aces
But it doesn't really matter how great the spaces

We're chained, and when everything else changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away our love will still remain
We're chained

Life has a fuse and it burns with quickness
But death ain't the long twisted branch of sickness
Just as the spark gives birth to a flame
We'll be bound by our love and then the family name

We're chained, and when everything else changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away our love will still remain
We're chained

// Blood Muscle Skin & Bone //

You're still alive inside somewhere
Or are you just remains?
You're blood muscle skin and bone
So people cause you pain
But when the skies are crashing down
And when my days are dark and grey
When my fires are burning low
When the life inside me fades
I know that I can count on you
Because you never let me lie
You bring the truth back to me
You bring my back to life

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

There's a place I call my home
Where the sun falls down on me
The light fills in the shadows there
And peace of mind is free
But far below that place
A tear forms in my eye
The shadows have no foe there
And darkness multiplies
I know that I can count on you
Because you've never lead me astray
You bring the truth back to me now
You always light my way

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

// I Belong To You //

Last night I had the exact same dream as you
I killed a bird to save your life
And you gave me your shoes
You said clip my wings and walk my miles
And I said I would too
Then I woke up but I wasn't gonna tell you

Today I sang the same damn tune as you
It was "lady in red" I hate that song
And I know you do too
You didn't catch me singin' along
But I always sing with you
Nice and quietly cuz I don't want to stop you

I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I see the world the exact same way that you do
We lend our hands and take our stance
In tandem when we do
But I lied and said I knew the way
I hid my eyes from you
I still don't know why I probably didn't want to scare you

I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you

I'm gonna die the exact same day as you
On the Golden Gate Bridge I'll hold your hand
And howl at the moon
Scrape the sky with tired eyes
And I will come find you
And I ain't scare cuz I'm never gonna miss you

I belong to you now
I belong to you 
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you

// Alibi //

I done some bad bad things
The kind you don't bring up at confession
Somewhere in my life, woah
I took the wrong direction
I swear on my soul
I didn't want to hurt no one
But I got no way to justify
The things I done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

You done some bad bad things
The kind that don't bare to mention
Something inside you died
Now you need some ressurrection
If you don't want to go down
Just like the setting sun
You got to find a way to reconcile
The things you done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

I swear some people in the world
They got no moral compass
I know the wicked ones
I feel them walk among us
The hangman begs for mercy
Only when his time has come
Because he got no way to
Rectify the things he done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

I won't take the fall for where I've been

I won't take that fall for where I've been, no

// The Stranger At My Door //

I have seen the firewatcher's daughter
Watching fires burn from smoke to black
There's nothing she won't burn
From Styrofoam to urns, to someone else's ashes in a sack

You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass
You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past
An all-consuming flame, that refines and new begins
It'll take your family heirlooms, but it can take your darkest sins

It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
But there ain't no hell for a firewatcher's daughter

We exorcise the demons of the things we used to know
The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes
We think we're moving on, from materials we long
To forget we ever sold our souls to own

There's a chilling absolution that we're given at our birth
A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth
But nothing scares me more
Than the stranger at my door
Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth

It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
Condemn their sons to Hades
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
But there ain't no hell for a firewatcher's daughter

// Heroes And Songs //

Some rights and some wrongs
Some heroes and songs
Are much better left unsolved
Between fiction and fact
Illusion and pact
Where we've been into what we've become
Although we have changed
We're never estranged
And there's nothing I'd trade from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

I'll never ally
All the voices goodbye
To the magical mystery tour.
Keep the tears that I cried
In my youth and my pride
And the sorrow like never before.
I've got thank you's and smiles
And affection for miles
And I always will look unto you
You held open the door
For who I'm sent here for
To come in and make my dreams come true.
Although it was sad
And it hurt 'cause it had to
There's nothing I'd change from before.
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

Although it was sad
And it hurt really bad
There's nothing I'd change from before
I love you my friend - my dear means to an end
But you're not in my dreams anymore.

You're not in my dreams anymore.

// Murder In The City //

If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
A person dead from such is plenty
There's no sense in getting locked away

And when I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over-alarmed
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

I wondered which of us is better
Which one our parents love the most
I certainly get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He'd say I love you both
And I'm proud of you in so many different ways

If I get murdered in the city
Go and read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings, darling
Pay attention to the list

Make sure my wife knows that I loved her
Make sure my daughter knows the same
And always remember there's nothing worth sharing
like the love that let's us share our name
Always remember there's nothing worth sharing
like the love that let's us share our name
