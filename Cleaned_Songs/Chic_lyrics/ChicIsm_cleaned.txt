Sometimes my soul gets week
All my eyes can see

Till the end of time
You'll always be mine

Life going nowhere
Lost, you don't care
Got no job, no money
No love and got no honey

Bills are growing through the roof
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove

Jusagroove, baby
Jusagroove
Jusagroove
Jusagroove

Look before you leap
Think before you speak
Loose lips sink ships
Head trips could make you slip

So be cool, don't be a fool
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove

Jusagroove, baby
Jusagroove
Jusagroove
Jusagroove

Just shoot your best shot
It might hit the spot
But don't lose your cool
Because life should be, jusagroove

Life going nowhere
Lost, you don't care
Got no job, no money
No love and got no honey

Bills are growing through the roof
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove

// Something You Can Feel //

I'm gonna explain it
I hope you retain it
The Chic Mystique
Well, I would paint it
F U N K
Psychedelic or solid
Sewn into place like a stitch in a wallet
Together again
Yo! Let the dancing begin
And don't stop, until the floor
Gets HOT!
Under your feet, because the music
Is smoking'
I'm not choking, my words are
Well spoken
Yo, when I'm talkin' loud
And I'm sayin' much, about CHIC
And we're
Gonna touch
The heart of your soul
In a special way
Yo! Remember the jams way back
In the day
Well they speak for themselves
And so does this funky beat
So get on the floor and move your feet
And don't stop until you get enough
That might be never
'Cause we pull a lever-inside
That pulls on heart strings
Nile and Nard
Producers (The Dance Kings)
So here's the chance to relive the past
But in the present you'll hit that
Dance floor
Fast
'Cause it's C H I C,
And that makes the jam "For Real"
'Cause it's something that you can feel

Feel----
Something that you can feel
Feel----
Something that you can feel
Feel----
Something that you can feel
Feel

Move!
I say that with conviction
The floor is so packed
You'll get high from the friction
Boom!
We'll fill the room with the dance move
Every time I rhyme on a Chic Groove

Come on with the force of an
Army brigade
And we'll be rising on the charts
Like a high-top fade
So just
Grab your partner and Dosie/Doe
'Cause with the neat, Chic beat
You're good to go
A combination of style that's sleek
And unique
Put it together
There you have it, Chic! How
Can you dance when your socks are
Knocked off?
Rock so hard
We can knock your block off
Charlie,
Get on your Harley and ride
Step to the inside
'Cause we're coming with the force
And the bass is our weapon
Sending all the suckers
Stepping for real

The urge to merge and
Surge from the Chic sound
You wanna get up
'Cause Man, you wanna get down
A sigh of relief
Becuse the band with the knack is back!
Kickin' the funk with soul
To Chic it's a snap
You wanna snap your fingers
And clap your hands
Your hair will stand on end
I mean every strand
We give no slack, 'cause the band
Is just too tight
I'm on the mic and I would like to invite
All the partygoers in the mood
For a treat
Sweet, now sugar-coated, 'cause the
Music is,
CHIC
Ah yeah

Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something that you can feel
Something you can feel [repeat]
You can feel
Feel---- [ad lib to end]

// One And Only One //

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

Every time I see you
I surrender
To a feeling never known

Every time I hear you
Speak so tender
You break my heart of stone

So I learned
These words of wisdom
From one who's a cut above

You said with all your passion
In them
When you live true life
You love, true love

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

Comforting as sunshine in my window
At the end of a rainy night
Awaken from a dream that echoes
Everything's all right

Something special happened to me
I've fallen under your spell
You've shown me how good it can be
So I might as well, kiss and tell

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

So many roads I've travelled
And wandered where I've been
Here and there
Everywhere

On the outside looking in
The future is uncertain
You can't guarantee tomorrow

But wichever the way the wind blows
In my heart
I'll always know, I'll always know
You're my one and only one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You know you're my one
My only one
You're second to none

You're my one
You're
You're second to none, baby

Oh, my baby

// Doin' That Thing To Me //

Do, do, do, do, do
Doin' that thing to me
Do, do, do, do, do
Doin' it

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

There's a magic
Only you posses
Cast your spell
A master of the kiss

Whisk me away
To another time and place
Uh - Huh
Uh - Huh

Like Eve to the Apple
Some things

I'm powerless to resist

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

A modern day Merlin
Who looks through my own eyes
You understand
Don't even have to trust

Some tell us of a Cinderella
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
But oh you're my Prince Charming
One kiss from you changed my hole life

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing
Doin' that thing, to me
(Do, do, do, do, do, doing it)

// Chic-Ism //

Ladies and gentlemen: Chic!

A show of hands, I thought so
Another band, I don't know
As good as this one you can't resist
One jam we'll pay, we'll rock to the break of

Day and night, we'll keep you working
Take my lead, your head will be jerking
Up and down, you'll lose control of
The moment you get a load of Chic

Chic, Chic
Chic
Chic, Chic
C.H., C.H.I.C.

Crisp cliches and witty words
Vocalists that chirp like birds
Rhymes topped with sweet harmonies
Magic fingers on the keys

There's more to us than meets the eye
Break it down and we'll show you why
Love what we do, we do you 'cause we love it
Get you so high that you can't rise above it

Chic

Chic, Chic
Chic
Chic, Chic
C.H., C.H.I.C.

Put your hands together one time
For the crew that brought you good times
Don't miss a beat, the flow is complete
The horns will blow you out of your seat

A friend by your side, make sure he's the dancing type
Right, to dance all night
Straight to the main floor
Like an apple hard-core

Much more in store, I'm sure you'll adore
What's the allure that you can't ignore
Could it be the things that I'm saying?
Could it be the strings playing?

Moves your soul to a new height
It's a good feeling, yeah, damn right!
I know it's the combination
It's the sensation

Back on track, it's about to happen
You know the runners' check out the rappin'
Energize, once you feel the funk
Just like Jordan before a slam dunk

Perfection, and we're on the brink
A live band, and we're all in sync
Sister to sister, bro' to bro'
So feel the flow and enjoy the show

C.H.
C.H.I.C.
C.H.
C.H.I.C.

Wait a minute!

Work hard and don't mind the overtime
Feel the rhythm, watch the heat climb
It builds just like a skyscraper
It won't taper, the rest are fakers

Check your butt, you know you can't sit
Chic is live, on the real tip
Tighter than a strongman's grip
Make you hop and bop 'cause it's hip

The best band you could ever find
Eureka, this groove's a gold mine
A new sound and it's called Chic-ism
Don't sweat it, get lost in the rhythm

Chic

Chic, Chic
Chic
Chic, Chic
C.H., C.H.I.C.

Chic, Chic
Chic
Chic, Chic
C.H., C.H.I.C.

// Take My Love //

Late in the evening
During the summertime
Desire is so hot!
Fell my temperature climb

Hot to the touch
Sweet lover's bite
Burns like a flame
Beneath my skin, outta sight

All I know is
I just want to love you
All over and over

Take my love
Please, take my love
Take my love

Please, take my love

Until love's price is paid

In full with interest
Here's the bottom line
I'm sure my securities
Will bring you peace of mind

All I know is
I just want to love you
All over and over

Take my love

// High //

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High

Like the feeling
That you're feeling
When you' re stoned to the bone

Don't get played out
Never fade out
'Cause you stayed out
All night long

Stayed out all night long

Gotta have It
Gotta habit

There's a monkey on your back.
Against the wall
In the valley of the dolls
Groovin' danceamaniacs

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get high, on a trip
The natural tip
I don't need no kinda' drugs

Sip with care
But don't be scared
You can never get too much
(Never get too much)

Gimme music, we can use it
There's no turning back for us
All for one, here's to freedom
In groove we trust

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get

High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me high, high

Dadada...
Music never stops, makes me
Dadada...
Take it to the top

Let's get
