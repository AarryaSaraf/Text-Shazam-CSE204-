Album: CestChic

// Chic Cheer //

Chic [repeat]
Everybody strut

Chic [repeat]
Everybody strut

Come on everybody
Give me a C C

Give me an H H

Give me an I I

Give me a C C

If your friends are chic
Consider yourself unique
Just one favour we ask
We hope it's not too hard a task
If you don't mind, would you please
Get up off of your seat and repeat

Chic

[Repeat and fade]

// Le Freak //

(One, two)

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Have you heard about the new dance craze?
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done

Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold
It's called le freak, they're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh, what a joy
Just come on down, two 54
Find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Now freak!

I said freak!

Now freak!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the ride
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh, what a joy
Just come on down, two 54
Find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

// Savoir Faire //

Dog man star took a suck on a pill
And stabbed a cerebellum with a curious quill
Europe, America, Winterland

Introducing the band

Chic thug stuttered through a stereo dream
A fifty knuckle shuffle heavy metal machine
The tears of suburbia drowned the land

Introducing the ban&100

So steal me a savage, subservient son
Get him shacked-up, bloodied-up and sucking on a gun
I want the style of a woman, the kiss of a man

Introducing the band

And as the sci-fi lullaby starts to build
See them whipping all the women, cracked governments killed
Oh let the century die to violent hands

Introducing the band

// Happy Man //

(I'm a) happy man, happy man, that's me
Happy man, for you all to see
Happy man, and the world is my home
Happy man, with a style of my own

When you see me, I'm a smilin' face
Spreadin' all my love around the place
All around the world I go travelling

When they see me come, they start to sing

Hanging out all night with the jet set
And I party every little chance I get
Don't you know life can be real nice

And if it's good, I do it twice

(I'm a) happy man, happy man, that's me
Happy man, for you all to see
Happy man, and the world is my home
Happy man, with a style of my own

// At Last I Am Free //

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

I'm lonely, please listen
To what I say
I can't go on
Livin' life this way
I've tried and I've tried
Oh, to make you see
You call this love?
All this lyin', my friend
It just can't be

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

I'm lonely, please hold me
Come closer, my dear
It feels so good
Just havin' you near
But who am I foolin'
When I know it's not real?
I can't hide
All this hurt and pain
Inside I feel

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free
I can hardly see in front of me
I can hardly see in front of me

At last I am free

// Sometimes You Win //

Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

And don't you know that life is just a game
That you play, win or lose, it's all the same
Open your eyes, you better
Look before you leap, take heed
And watch the signs of life
Don't play the cheat
The wheel of fortune just may take its toll
Be a gambler, play your ace in the hole
You'll never know
You might wind up way ahead
Shoot your best shot
Take a little chance before you're dead

Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

Here you come with that smile on your face
I assume that even time cannot erase
Confidence is the most important thing you need
To look inside yourself, you can succeed
All the time you better watch out for the trap
Be careful or first time out
You might roll crap
One mistake and life comes tumblin' down
All around, like galloping dominoes
That's how it goes

Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

// (Funny) Bone //

Just one more thing
Remember the whole world's a circus
Don't you be the clown
