// Disappear //

Kiss me on my neck
Tell me all your fears
'Cause the rush of love is gone
I'm tryna find out why it disappeared
Why it disappeared

I look you in the eyes
Don't feel nothing here
'Cause the feeling of the love that I used to have
Well that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared

Do you remember
Our love in November
That shit was so real
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal
There's patches on my fingers that won't feel
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back

// Ceilings //

Love me like a garden filled with flowers
Like the driest desert in the rain
Love me like cigarettes in Paris
Love me like a book that has no name

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

Miss me like the scent of your first room
The thing you've always wanted to go back to
Ceilings were so high when you were five
Miss me like the way your mother misses your height

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

// Angel //

White angel come
Intoxicate my blood
Just another hit
You'd get used to it
Just another grit

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

I'm scared of life
It's in my blood
So I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
Falling on my face

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

// You Lie All the Time //

You lie all the time
Yeah you do
But I can't complain
'Cause I'm just afraid of losing you

You don't understand
Yeah you don't
'Cause if I explained
You'd just hate the way it goes

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

You say it's alright
Yeah you do
But it's fine
'Cause you hate to see me cry
Cry
Cry

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

And if you ask me
What I'd wanna do
I'd look you in the eyes
And end up asking you (oh)
You (oh)
Oh you
Oh you

// Soren //

Miss your hair
I like the way you stare
Into my eyes
Most the time
The way you touch me
Is like a curse that can't be broken
But it hurts
Most the time

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight

The green in your eyes
Are like the leaves in the summer
And it changes
With the weather
The pink in your cheeks
When you slightly loose your temper
Makes me love you
Even more

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight
