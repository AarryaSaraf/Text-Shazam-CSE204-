// Between The Bars //

Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be, that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
When I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
I'll keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

// Coffee //

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine
And I promise that one day I'll feel alright

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

Don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me
Tight

You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

// Don't You (Forget About Me) //

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oooh...

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down

Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't

La la la...

As you walk on by (Don't you forget about me)
Will you call my name? (Don't don't don't don't)
As you walk on by (Don't you forget about me) 
Will you call my name? (Don't don't don't don't)

// Eleanor & Park //

The morning bus rides
Your face makes me want to smile
Park, wait for me outside
So you can see what's inside my mind
I'll bring you comics to make you laugh
On days where you feel kinda sad
I want you to feel adored
Oh my god I love your voice
Take me in your arms now baby
Hold me like you'll never leave me
I know you don't have it easy
You'll get through it if you're with me
Eleanor, are you feeling cold
No hesitation I'll give you my coat
You're so sweet I'll let you know
You're the type of guy to never let go
I don't wanna go back home
I don't wanna want you to be on your own
Take me in your arms now baby
Hold me like you'll never leave me
I know you don't have it easy
You'll get through it if you're with me

// Get Along //

Tell me the things you let me know
No need to rush we'll take it slowly
Guess, our worlds colliding
The difference in us is hard to prove
Guess I just have to get to know you
But, I'll take my time trying

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

Spending all of our time figuring what to do
Not to far there's a place just for us two
Its an endless world that's outside so I'm sticking with you
Guess it's fine in our minds there's enough to do

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

In a place not far from home
Somewhere we both go
In our way we can't relay
In the end we're just the same

I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

// Glue Song //

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you

I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

// Glue Song (Remix) //

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared, oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you

I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

// iScream //

I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

Corbyn, my best friend
Taught me everything I know in my head, and he's
Braindead in the tool shed
Didn't hear a single word you said

I must apologize
Say it one more time mister magpie
Goodbye cool guy
Laugh again, you're gonna get a bruised eye
What's your problem
With me?
Something's gone wrong
What the hell is happening?

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

This could be forever
Is that too much to ask?
We'll try and make it last
One day more
We could be together
Hang out in the day
But then you'll eat my brain
So whatever

In my jeans
This ice cream is for everyone
And I want you to be the one
In my dreams
I run around the world sometime
Then I'll take you back to mine

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

In my rocky beep beep

I'm vindicated
You're saturated
Will you stop taking it?
Just a wannabe, beep beep
I dream this dream
I can't explain it
And I just shave my head
Goodbye honeybee, beep beep

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

What's your problem with me?
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

// Silver Into Rain //

Someday I'll be caught up in the wind
Maybe I'll spill it out my skin
And the earth will take me down
One day I'll no longer have my bed
And I'll forget the things you said
On a rainy week in June

Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blow me away, I'm too young for my age
Too shy for the stage, too careful to be brave

Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late
Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late

Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosé
Gold into grey and the silver into rain

I'm blowing away, I'm sipping on rosé
Gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver

I'm too young for my age

// Susie May //

Susie May goes out at night
Thinking of all the things she likes
She can't afford to throw those things away
Susie May forgets she's not okay

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night?
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly?
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see?
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night?
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly?
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see?
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

// Winter Wonderland //

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Yes, until the other kiddies knock him down

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
