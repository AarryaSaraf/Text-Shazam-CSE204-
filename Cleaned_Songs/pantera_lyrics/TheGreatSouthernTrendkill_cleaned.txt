// The Great Southern Trendkill //

It's wearing on my mind,
I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
You rob a dead mans grave,
Then flaunt it like you did create

If I hit bottom and everythings gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run

It's digging time again,
you're nurturing the weakest trend

Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking

Fuck your magazine,
and fuck the long dead plastic scene
Pierce a new hole,
if Hell was "in" you'd give your soul

THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL

Buy it at a store,
from MTV to on the floor
You look just like a star,
it's proof you don't know who you are

If I hit bottom and everythings gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run

It's bullshit time again,
you'll save the world within your trend

Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking

Politically relieved,
you're product sold and well received
The right words spoken gold,
if I was God you'd sell your soul to...

THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL
That's right,
THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL

// Drag The Waters //

A smack on the wrists is the words from the mouth
of the outsiders, lawyers, police
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns
and the rape, it should all be O.K.
Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man,
he's the God that got your sentence reduced
But in the back of his mind, he well knows what
he'd find if he looked a little deeper in you - in you

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

Sweet is the slice and the lips - you're gonna have that woman -
she is your favorite lay
Promised you (swore) that no one had been there,
and she was going to keep it that way
Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and
your money went and so did your friends
But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide
the premonition of the beckoning end - the end

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

In with it, out with it

// 10's //

My skin is cold,
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old,
Drop into fruitless dying

It was tempting and bared,
The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers,
My silent time of losing

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur,
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt,
Disgusted with my cheapness

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes, My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Reaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

My foes, My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself, like life itself

// 13 Steps To Nowhere //

Whores
Your windows boarded up,
Your private lives exposed
The talk shows pump it up,
Lab rats diseased for show

We're doomed to use the slang,
Outbreak of drug roulette
A church burned to the ground,
Not even noticed yet

13 Steps (To Nowhere)

Whores

A backwards swastika,
The black skin riddled in lead
A Nazi Gangster Jew,
It beats a dog that's dead

It's in to use the slang,
Outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side,
Will prove the damnedest yet

13 Steps - Leads to nowhere

The backlash dislocates,
An untimely reign of death
The wolf poked with the stick,
Awaits with cancerous breath

(Leads to nowhere)

Outsiders still suppose,
There's Holy streets to roam
The truth should not surprise,
Your homes were built on lies

13 Steps

// Suicide Note Pt. I //

Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot see inside yours and mine

[Pre]
When I'm hiding, when I need it,
it lets me breathe,
for our handle on this life, I don't believe
this time

[Chorus]
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again.....

Forever fooling, free and using,sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
It's a damn shame, but who's to blame?

[Pre]
[Chorus]

// Living Through Me (Hells' Wrath) //

I cannot take the take,
your condition was nod awake
A selfish cryer, boldface liar,
robbing all of what you could take in

Stabbed towards a death,
a dirty smelling girl
Shit decisions, no provisions,
filling veins with juice of chaos

[Chorus]
Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag,
sunken eyes, whining dog,
it's times like this you should pray for never

I broke your fucking mold
then threw away the cast,
new religion and new provisions,
it's amazing you're alive

Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more

So I mended severed ties,
through flesh we cauterized
the undeserving, sliming, writhing,
I filled you up with watered promise

[Chorus]

[Chorus #2]
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck,
angel dust, anal whore, bleeding knees,
it's times like this to pray for murder
So now I've seen it all,
Hells' wrath,
no man has greater glory,
cause now you're living through me

So I'm done with saving you,
a gift unto myself,
a tired savior, a wasted favor,
and I'm lucky I'm alive

I broke your fucking mold
then threw away the cast

[Chorus]
[Chorus #2]

// Floods //

A dead issue
Don't wrestle with it
Deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss
So inviting (let me in)

Nailed to the cross
I feel you, relate to you, accuse you
Wash away us all
Take us with the floods
Then throughout the night, they were raped and executed
Cold hearted world

Your language unheard of
the vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity
Is seen one sidedly

Burn away the day
The nervous, the drifting, the heaving
Wash away us all, take us with the floods
Then throughout the day mankind played with grenades
Cold hearted world
And at night they might bait the pentagram
Extinguishing the sun
Wash away man, take him with the floods

// The Underground In America //

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

Glass breaks
the dimming lights
sweat, heat and profane debate
the smart ones stay on the outside
while drunken heads and arms erupt

centered man swings a punch,
spits a tooth, postures odd
a punk rock escapade
five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd

We are the ones who must sport the position

cheap beer
trendy clicks
lesbian love is accepted and right
shaved heads meet hair in the mix
blending the 80's and 90's with hate

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

Shows on
dates canceled
kicked out for reasons that seem so unfair
skin crusts against the cops
a foregone conclusion that's tired and beat

Ringworm,crabs and lice
V.D. ecstasy, speed and horse
a heaven of unmatched importance
an honor of sex to be stuck by the punk

Rich homes with money and food
abandoned for the bums on the street
a lifestyle that's unexplainable
don't try and save what is all meant to be

Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

If it is free
from (a) family that's seen
you can just keep it
if you must beg
it's better instead
you must follow the etiquette

You know when it rains you're in your bed at home
You act so real when you are alone
You better not let the mohawked crowd see
Give it five years, you'll retire your piercings
You must admit that you mimic the weaklings
