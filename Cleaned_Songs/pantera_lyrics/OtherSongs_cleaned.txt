// Avoid The Light //

[Reversed:]
His stillborn army is impeccable
Satan's wrath is the only choice

Modern day plague
Stronger than any and every virus, disease or sickness
Full eclipse
Of ideology
Anti-christian
And eternally alive (undead)
Buried underneath
Two thousand years (of histories)
Yet able to rise
Instinctively arise

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light

True and purely horror
Man's ultimate enemy and predator wrapped into one

Spread like wings
Of damnated
Then folding into
Shape immortal man (not slaved)
Plasmic umber
Will override (true emotions)
The peer inversion
To guard my countless graves

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Alone, unseen, reborn, received

It's a battle of wills (it's a battle of wills)
Ingloriously killed (we shall devour)

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light

[Reversed:]
His stillborn army is impeccable
Satan's wrath is the only choice

// Cat Scratch Fever //

I'm high!

Well, I don't know where they come from but they sure do come
I hope they comin' for me
And I don't know how they do it but they sure do it good
I hope they're doin' it for free

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Well, the first time that I got it I was just ten years old
I got it from some pussy next door
An' I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure
I think I want it some more

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
I got a bad scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

It's nothin' dangerous
I feel no pain
I've got a choo-choo train
You know you got it when, you go insane
It makes a grown man cry, cry, oh won't you make my bed

Well, I made her pussy purr with the stroke of my hand
They know they gettin' it from me
They know just where to go when they need their lovin' man
They know I'm doin' it for free

I give them cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
They got it bad scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever [x8]

Cat, scratch, fever!

// Immortally Insane //

Deathlike silence
Red cloud shakes
A race that walls immortality
The undying battle of extinction
Who would believe in sanctuary

Huh, sanctuary

Weapons of lead are post-historic
Life is yielded unto sour ground
A desert shell is designated
A warning to you both man and beast

Destroying, destroying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, I'm going
Forever, forever

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Eden hardly a tranquil place
The prophecy lears its hateful face
The warheads like lightning strike again and again
Seperating the land from the wolf and man

Huh, no sanctuary

Survivors will rise from strength and brain
The skulls of rivals lay in rows on the sand
The seeds of breeding swallow the waste
Creating more for the next war

Destroying, destroying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, I'm goin
Forever, forever

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Insane
