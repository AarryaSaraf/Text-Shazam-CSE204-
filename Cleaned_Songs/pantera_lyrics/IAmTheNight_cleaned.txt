// Hot And Heavy //

You say that
you want a piece of me
well baby 
take a big bite
too much to believe
that's what I like
I've been known 
to blow my top
just to get my kix
I might eat 
your heart out 
just to get my kix 

I've got a line on U
I've got my ize on U
I'm gonna luv U
Black and blue
I'm cummin' down on U 

I'm burnin' hot
HOT AND HEAVY
It's what I want
HOT AND HEAVY 

Take a look at
my ice cream cone baby
go ahead take a lick
can't wait
to take you home
beat you with my stick
I've seen what
you got before
but I'd like
to see it again
it's red hot
that's for sure
tell me girl
where and when

// I Am The Night //

I am the lightning
and the storm
all hell broke loose
on the night I was born
a child of fire
and burning flames
look to the east
and you'll see hence I came 

Might throw you into the darkness
or save you by the light
of the moon and stars
ever shining
celestial bodies burning bright
burning bright 

I, I AM THE NIGHT
I, I AM THE NIGHT 

I am the terror
the beast at large
heed my warning
sound the alarm
an endless shadow
for daylight you pray
lock your doors
but you cannot get away 

Tender angels of mercy
how they run from my sight
eclipsed into darkness
searching only for the light
for the light
for the light 

I, I AM THE NIGHT
I, I AM THE NIGHT

// Onward We Rock! //

Hungry and hunting
passion and fire
we're burning
hot on the heels of death
strength and suspicion
armored with steel
ready for action
tonite we're out for the kill! 

ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top
ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top 

Torture and trial
under the gun
wheels burnin'
burnin' to be No.1
dangerous warning
backs to the wall
smell the sweat
the Pain, the thrill of it all! 

ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top
ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top
ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top
ONWARD WE ROCK!
Straight to the top

// Daughters Of The Queen //

The coach stands 
waiting just outside
just in case the queen
should want to take a ride
but she stays
safely locked away
she knows the world outside
can be so cold and grey 

DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime
Before it slips away 

Her castle
looms into the sky
behind those walls
you'll never see
a fear fall from her eye
she seems content
to live her life all alone
but locked inside
those castle walls
her heart has turned to stone 

DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime
Before it slips away 
DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN
Come let me hold your hand
Isn't it about time
You need to feel a man 

Today Her Majesty has gone
in death's repose
it's much too late
she lies there all alone
alas the dreams
inside her heart
sleep forever silent
imprisoned by the dead 

DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN
Come outside and Play 
Slip into the nighttime
Before it gets too late

// Come-on Eyes //

Love at first sight
I caught a glimpse
and I thought I'd try
to win her love
for my very own 

She's the kind
that'll move on a dare
she loves a thrill
she'll take it anywhere
but when you need her
she won't be there
won't be there
she's never there 

She's got COME-ON EYES
Happens every time
Never givin' her love
Only givin' you lies
She'll put you thru hell
No matter how hard you try
She's got COME-ON EYES

I can't win
she drives me insane
broken heart is
the name of her game
down on my knees
beggin' to Please
needin' her love 

All alone
out on the street
she was layin' me out
knocked me off my feet
she's always on my mind
it's what I'm thinkin' of 

She's got COME-ON EYES
Happens every time
Never givin' her love
Only givin' you lies
She'll put you thru hell
No matter how hard you try
She's got COME-ON EYES

// Right On The Edge //

Shot rings out
hear somebody scream
nightmare
caught up in a fantasy
tied up
fear's workin' overtime
wrecks my sanity
lay down
ear touched the floor
telephone rings
it's someone at the door
it's alright
just the paperboy
hear with the magazines 

Can't you see I'm 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE
On the verge
Of going crazee
My whole life's been livin'
RIGHT ON THE EDGE
Don't you try and stop me
Life is drivin' me insane 

Lights out
can't see a damn thing
shot down
eyes of a hurricane
it's all wrong
stumble outa bed
reach for a cigarette
busted
runnin' in the dead of nite
locked up
back of a black and white
too late
gotta pay the price
luck's runnin' out again 

Can't you see I'm 
RIGHT ON THE EDGE
On the verge
Of going crazee
My whole life's been livin'
RIGHT ON THE EDGE
Don't you try and stop me
Life is drivin' me insane 

I'M NOT CRAZEE!!!!!!!!

// Valhalla //

There is a place
where every man who falls
in battle surely will go
and in this place
lives a God
who is their Lord
one of knowledge
who surely knows 

Eyes are burning brightly
shining on into the night
heads are falling
valkyries calling
back the men to fight
for The Terrifier
Magic Mystifier
preparation for victory
Mighty Oh! VALHALLA
they're coming Home
to VALHALLA 

Each day the valiant
armies of the past
would fight outside the hall
then in the evening
the vanquished would rise up
with the victors
and feast one and all 

Written on the runes
the many tales of men of old
ancient kings who ruled the land
a thousand years ago
prayed to The Terrifier
Magic Mystifier
for knowledge and Victory
Mighty Oh! VALHALLA 
they're coming home to VALHALLA 

Come the final battle
Odinn charges on his steed
Fenrir's foe is thrusting home
but it was not to be
now The Terrifier
Magic Mystifier
Vanquished but he will live on
Mighty Oh! In VALHALLA
He's living on In VALHALLA
VALHALLA!

// Forever Tonight //

I've been waiting
all my life
for the moment
to be right

You and me
tonite could be the night
a love fantasy
my heart keeps cryin'

FOREVER TONITE 
FOREVER TONITE 

I wanna feel 
you in my arms
I wanna love you till
the emptiness is gone 

Take my hand
Tonite could be the nite
understand
my heart is cryin' 

FOREVER TONITE
FOREVER TONITE 

Tonite may 
never come again
don't want to
let this feelin'
ever ever end 

You and me
tonite could be the nite
fall in love
my heart keeps cryin' 

FOREVER TONITE
FOREVER TONITE
