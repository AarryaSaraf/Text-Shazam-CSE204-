// Genesis //

In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know, I roar like a lion
For you, you know I'll keep trying 'til the sun stops rising

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

// Last Dance //

Fatal, this attraction,
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali
When I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel—feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

My eyes wide open,
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me
And it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel—feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love

// Hotter Than Hell //

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you the pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby you should touch me right there
You can take me right there
We can make it

Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

Not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

Oh, but when you're gone

// IDGAF //

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (Get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

// Blow Your Mind (Mwah) //

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah...)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up

// New Love //

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this baby ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
Where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love

Even though I've run away, I still come back
No there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
Where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle?

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love

// No Goodbyes //

Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave
And it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends
Without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
(All alright)
Why don't we hold each other
Use each other, whisper pretty lies
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to
See the light of truth
Between me and you
We can stay blind
In the meantime
Let our bodies say
What we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
(All alright)
Why don't we hold each other
Use each other, whisper pretty lies
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
No goodbyes (No goodbyes)
No goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
(All alright)
Why don't we hold each other
Use each other, whisper pretty lies
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

// Thinking 'Bout You //

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

// Room For 2 //

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

// Lost In Your Light //

[Dua Lipa:]
Over and over
Waves of running feelings
Floating weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking
Honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

[Miguel:]
Oh
Now everything's vivid, vivid
Touch attempted with pleasure
Reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted
Woman

[Both:]
Hold me, trust me
[Miguel:]
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
[Both:]
Hold me, trust me
[Miguel:]
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

[Both (Miguel):]
Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

[Dua Lipa (Miguel) {Both}:]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
{Let's get lost in the light, baby} (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
{Let's get lost in the light, baby}

// Bad Together //

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
(Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
(Baby, I'm okay)

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

// Garden //

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost, can't get back again
Tell me, is the light on the outside?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you? Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you? Are you with me?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden…)

// Dreams //

Last night, my fantasies become oh-so true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then though baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
(Know, know, know)

In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like yeah, yeah
You love me right, oh, yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is ticking, we gotta leave now
Time is ticking, and we gotta leave town tonight

Can I get it like that, that, that, let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
(Know, know, know)

In my dreams
You'd say you want me and my body
In my dreams
You'd say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You'd say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

You love me like yeah, yeah

// New Rules //

One, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn) no way
(Nowhere to turn) no
Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
(I got new, I got new, I...)

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Oh, whoa-oh)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You gettin' over him

// Begging //

All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
Not running away

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

// Homesick //

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops
Then, darling, what will I do
And I know I go all in
But why do I

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over
That watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
