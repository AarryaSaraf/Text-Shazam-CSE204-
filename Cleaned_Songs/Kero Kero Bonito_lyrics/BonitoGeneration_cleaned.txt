// Waking Up //

What's that?
Wanna go back to sleep...

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

Get up, get up! What's that in the sky?
Could it be? It's KKB!
パワーアップして戻ってきたぜ
無敵のヒーロ、それがボニト
Rise and shine, it's party time
Eat your breakfast, and you'll be fine
Everybody, エンジンスタート
ケロケロワールドへご招待

苦手な早起き
でもわいてくるよ、やる気
始まる一日
波に乗りたい (yo yo yo yo yo yo)
Back in the place, I'm looking great
Bet you can't tell I'm half awake
Living my way, no day is the same
But sometimes I'm a bit late

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

3, 2, 1, lift-off, infinity
Let's go on a Kero Kero journey
Get on the bus and hold on tight
スピードマックス going so high
世界のみんなへ届ける
International 楽しい sound
僕たち3人ビートにのせて
But then I wonder, is it all a dream?

Whoaaaaaa

When I hear that alarm clock ring
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part
But then, it's essential

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

// Heard A Song //

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Cruising along in my new car
Top down, round the block, not too fast
All I need is bass on the stereo
So I turn it up and it goes like
"Oh-oh-oh-oh," it's a beat so sweet
That I stop in the middle of the street
Then a kid runs up and he says
"I don't know you but that sounds fresh"

When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this

I get back to my dominion
And ask my friends their opinion
I heard this song on the radio
(Sounds cool, Sarah, how did it go?)
Like "oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh?"
(I don't know)
Hm, well, if nobody can help me
Did I imagine this melody?

When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like

// Graduation //

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

These are the best days of our lives
That's what the grown ups told us, right?
Tapping my pencil, waiting for the bell
Thinking what to say in my last farewell
Hey teacher, leave those kids alone
さいごのタイムがなてるよ
And everyone's happy, but 行きたくない
What shall I do now the world is mine?

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw (but I'm not going)
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

窓の外ばかり見てた
まるとばつだけだった
そんな世界にさようなら
一人卒業式 say
先生、みんな、さようなら
先生、みんな、さようなら
先生、みんな、さようなら
耳の中で卒業

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw
I'd like to thank my pets, my friends, my family
I didn't learn a thing anyway
What you wanna be?
There's so much you can do with a degree
Now I can apply for a PhD
Get a nice job with a high salary
Chasing after 100点、満点
全部できたくない、もうだめ
鳥かごの扉を開けて
空に向かって羽ばたいて

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw (but I'm not going)
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going)
(But I'm not going today)

// Fish Bowl //

Small fish stuck in a fish bowl
Do you pine for the sea?
Watching life all around you
Are you looking at me?

Swim around in a circle
Come along when it's feeding time
You're the king of the castle
Who likes to hide (whoa-oh)
But when you find the ocean
How will you know where to go?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh
Oooh-oooh oooh ooh oh oh [x2]
Yeah...

小さい場所だけど
幸せそう
When I see you tomorrow
Will you remember this song?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh
Oooh-oooh oooh ooh oh oh [x2]
Yeah...

// Big City //

アスファルト、ビル・建物
広がるよ、ネオンライト
町の光がたくさんの星に見える

And it's true
I was kind of lonely at first
So I took life in my own hands
Got a haircut, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
Cause we stick around anyway

早歩き、で消えて行く
Everybody here's just passing through
The city never sleeps, 今夜もみんなどこに
行くの?

色とりどり
染めておけば
形が
見えてくる
まだ私を知らない
この町、この big city
生まれ変わる
It's a blank canvas, made of concrete

Oh-ooh-oh
I was kind of lonely at first
So I took life in my own hands
Saw a movie, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
Cause we stick at it anyway

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
That's what I heard someone say...

// Break //

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
In fact, there's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true
When there is something to do

目の前を
ぐるぐる世界が駆け抜ける
でも私は daydream 夢見てる
Look out the window 窓の外
Watching the world go by, goodbye
みんなどこかへ向かってる
でもかみが dancing in the wind
こういう時に思うんだ
生きていて本当によかった
幸せ気分になれるんだ
これでいい気がするんだ
I got a smile on my face
Cause now I'm taking a break

何もしないこの時間
今っていうこの瞬間
ペースにブレーキかけて
Let's slow down

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
In fact, it's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true
When there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Now get down and put up your feet (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
If you like to lounge, relax, or flop (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat
(a-yo, a-a-yo-o)

空を見上げる満月
星ってこんなに嫌いなんだ
こういう時に思うんだ
生きてるって不思議
Life is a race, that's what they say
So time out, and look around
立ち止まると見えてくる
I see it now
(Take a break!)

"Hey, you've reached Gus and Jamie from KKB
We're recording right now
So leave your message after the beep"
Yo, Gus and Jamie, it's Sarah
Just to let you know that I don't wanna do anything today
So I'll see you later, bye!

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we could all go take a break
In fact, it's not much better than nothing at all
And that's especially true
When there is something to do

Just move very slowly to the beat (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Now get down and put up your feet (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
If you like to lounge, relax, or flop (a-yo, a-a-yo-o)
Doesn't really matter when you're doing squat (a-yo, a-yo)

// Lipslap //

やめろ!

Thumb and forefinger tap, laughter
Yeah, you know it
A fingertip placed on the lips which gave a little (shh!)
Maybe we'll talk about that, not now
You see I'm jackin'
All my friends are here, there's just
No time for taboo
Can't believe I have to rap on tracks so you get it
Wanna talk about so much stuff then you just give me hush
We can sort that out for now, the place is packing
Spent the cash on a new dance floor
And everyone's come through

It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I can't hear you cause this beat is taking over
I'm not one to lip-read and you don't come with subtitles
You sure talk the walk into your walkie-talkie
But you can't keep a secret and you never get a word in (Uhh?)
Why don't you keep me in the loop, I like it posted
You stay here and watch an old brick wall get freshly painted
If you didn't catch the facts, I'll repeat them
But to be as smart as me you have to know the slang
Yeah

It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper
Take turns seeing where it lands

It's all lipslap (Get down!)
Thinking caps (What?)
Just lipslap (Be proud!)
That is that
It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap (Yeah)
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper
Take turns seeing where it lands

// Try Me //

Hey, let's go, I can take it
What do you want to know?
得意なことを
自己アピール
I can appear as and when you need
365日
I speak different languages
And people get what I mean
中学生の頃は
I was the best in every class
ブラバン部で
楽器も吹けるよ(ほら!)

But sometimes if I think too hard
I forget that I'm a superstar

Try me! Try me!
Cause I bet I got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me! Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities:
Business!
Dancing!
Throwing a party...with you!

聞いてほしいの
私のこと
All you guys are the same, oh
Just so predictable
短所は頑固なところ
I like to stick to my principles
いつも前向きに行こうよ
それがモット
I'm gonna make it to the top
夢を叶えたいの
But when I do I can promise I won't stop (yeah right)

Try me! Try me!
Cause I bet I got what you really need
I'm quick to learn and I can work with people in a team
Try me! Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities

Step by step, 少しずつ
高く高く登る
踊り場に着いたら
休憩タイムで一休み
Think about where I'm going to go
階段登れば登るほど
景色がきれいになってゆく
終わりには何が待っている?

But sometimes if I think too hard
I forget that I'm a superstar

Try me! Try me!
Cause I bet I've got what you really need

Try me! Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
Just witness this impressive list of my activities

Try me! Try me!
Cause I bet I've got what you really need

Try me! Try me!
Did you know I can do anything?
I'm seeking a position in a fine society
Try me!

// Paintbrush //

色を混ぜて
魔法をかけて paintbrush
好きなように
赤、青、むらさき

昨日の夢が
今日の現実に
変わる

色を混ぜて
魔法をかけて paintbrush
真っ白な世界が

// Trampoline //

As the rain came down my window
I heard the wind blow all around
I was stuck under the weather
Felt like forever out of the sun
But then I looked at my garden
And saw at the bottom my old trampoline
That's when I knew what to do
I could break right on through
Yeah, the clouds aren't so high

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

Though I love it when I'm floating
It's kind of lonely at the top
But if we all jump together
Then we'll go higher
We'll never stop
I know I've got to come down
Put my feet on the ground soon
But that's okay
You see, I'm safe in the knowledge
No matter what, I got my old trampoline

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

つまずいて落ちてくことってあるけど
どん底の底の底って何があるか知ってる?
どんどん落ちていくとトランポリンがあるんだよ
突き落とされても大丈夫
手をあげて飛び上がれ!

Even if you're falling, that's okay
There's a trampoline waiting for you
It's so easy, you just have to believe
信じればいいんだよ

So jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be
Jump, jump, trampoline, fly to where you want to be

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

// Picture This //

Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet

It's pretty great, photos let me take
All the sights I see, food I eat
Everywhere with me
Though they're 2D, pics are all I need
To show everyone what I've done
Who I want to be

I check that no one else is around
And I take a picture of myself

Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet

すぎていく毎日だけど楽しい時間えいえんにかえよ
忘れないこの瞬間写真の中でいきてるよ
And I really couldn't say why my life is so photographic
Cause these days it's just automatic
Show me a pic or it didn't even happen
みんなでならんで笑って Peace
放課後のプリクラ
しゃめとってじどりして
おくってかえしてとこして
So picture this

I check that no one else is around
And I take a picture of myself

Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet
Hold your camera high and click
Exercise your right to picture this
But don't forget to show
Everybody you've ever known
When you're old and wise you'll find
All the shots you've got
Bring back the time it's easy to believe
Yesterday was so sweet
Yesterday was so sweet

// Hey Parents //

No matter what you do, there's something everyone shares
We all inherit ourselves from a pair
And if you never met them all, you call them your friends
One thing is certain, the tree never ends

And though it's been a while since I first saw them
I still say

Hey, mom, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon

I sure don't know if making me was part of the plan
But that's what happened, and I'm cool with that
But now I'm here, I better go find something to do
Something I want to, so they can relax

私の前には、 ママとパパ
そのまた前には grandma, grandpa
もっと前に、their mum and dad
Am I next?

Hey, mom, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon

Soon will I find my life
Has happened all before?
Sometimes I realize
Time's running out and I don't know why
ずっと子供でいたいのに

Hey, mom, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon
Cause I'm coming over soon
Cause I'm coming over soon
