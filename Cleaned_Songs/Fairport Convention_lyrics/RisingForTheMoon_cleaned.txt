// Restless //

Born between a river and a railroad
Restlessness has ruled me since I can't remember when
There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

There are dreams that I have carried all my lifetime
And the dreams have made me a stranger in the eyes of many a man
For I do not count the time and my reasons do not rhyme
And down the line and on my way, on my way again

Oh, rolling along like a shipwrecked sailor
Who never finds a home
Broken lines and signs of failure
Rub me to the bone

Well, I'm weary of the company of strangers
I'm weary of the city with its heart of hollow stone
Something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
Yes, I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
Yes, I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again...

// White Dress //

Feel how the wind blows, December despair
Bring me a ribbon to tie up my hair
I'll be your bride, go where you go
All of my life, you'll be my beau

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

The night's in your face, sky's in your eyes
The day's in my arms when you're by my side
Whenever you're weary I'll sing you a song
Whenever you're lonely I'll show you you're wrong

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

Come from the window, let's climb the stairs
All of my sorrows are none of your cares
While life is in us, let's love all we can
I'll be your woman if you'll be my man

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight
