// What Is Hip? //

So you want to jump out your trick bag
And ease on into a hip bag
But you ain't just exactly sure what's hip
So you start to let your hair grow
Spend big bucks to top your wardrobe
But somehow you know there's much more to the trip

(What is hip) tell me, tell me if you think you know
(What is hip) if you're really hip, the passing years will show
You in a hip trip, maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip

You became part of the new breed
Been smoking only the best weed
Hanging out on the so-called hippest set
Been seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied, but still it ain't quite right

(What is hip) tell me, tell me if you think you know
(What is hip) if you're really hip, the passing years will show
You in a hip trip, maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip

Hipness is (well) what it is
Hipness is (yeah) what it is
Hipness is (uh huh) what it is
And sometimes hipness is what it ain't
Hey, hey

You done went and found you a guru
In an effort to find you a new you
And maybe even managed to raise your conscious level
While you're striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today might become pass√©

(What is hip) tell me, tell me if you think you know
(What is hip) if you're really hip, the passing years will show
You in a hip trip, maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip

Think about it, y'all

(What is hip) tell me, tell me if you think you know
(What is hip) if you're really hip, the passing years will show
(What is hip) tell me, tell me if you think you know
(What is hip) if you're really hip, the passing years will show

(What is hip) ah
(What is hip) ha, I'd like to know
(What is hip) is it in the style of your hair
(What is hip) is it in the clothes that you wear

(What is hip) ha, I'd like to know
(What is hip) I'd like to know
(What is hip) what is hip, y'all, hey
(What is hip) hey, ho, oh

(What is hip) what is hip, y'all
(What is hip) I wanna know
(What is hip) I
(What is hip) hey, I wanna know what hip it is

// Clever Girl //

Clever girl you fooled me once again
Clever girl seems I can't remember when
There was a time I didn't have you on my mind
But that heart of mine made me think the winnin' card was mine
Now I start to understand I must be just part of your plan
Must be part of your plan girl
Just must be part of your plan

Clever girl, you got me on the run
Clever girl, this time lovin' ain't no fun
I knew right from the start that only you could touch my heart
The way you move my soul girl you have complete control
But now the time has come for me to deal the final hand
Gonna call your bluff girl
Just got to show you my stuff

Soon the game will come to an end
And there'll be nothin' left for you to do except pretend
You're a clever girl in the game you will remain
Oh, but clever girl things will never be the same
You just keep on runnin' there'll be no place to go
After all your friends have vanished you'll find yourself alone
Maybe then you'll realize you won't so clever after all
You're headed for a fall girl
Then you'll have no one at all

Clever girl
Clever girl

// This Time It's Real //

This time it's real

Saw me a girl today
Who walk with such a gentle sway
And I knew right from the start
She was the one who can cop my heart
I know someday
That we could happen
In a special way
I wish I may
I wish I might
Make you my all-star shining bright

And I know, I can feel it
This time it's real

Other girls that I had were fine
But they were mainly just to pass the time
Though I must confess I had some fun
Now I know that you're the only one
All I can say girl
Is that I love you each and every day
And if I may
If I might
I'll make you the all-star of my life

And I know, I can feel it, hey
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey
This time it's real

Now's the time for me to make my move
Girl we gotsa get in the groove
It's what we do with the what we got
Gonna put us up in the slot
And I hope and pray
We'll get together with no delay
It might be day
It might be night
It don't matter anytime is right

And I know, (Oh) I can feel it (hey)
This time it's real
And I know, (Ahh) I can feel it
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yeay)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yeah child)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yes)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (hey)
This time it's real
I can feel it
This time it's real
I can feel it
This time it's real
I can feel it

// Will I Ever Find A Love? //

Oh look at me
A lonely man in a busy world
I try to get ahead
But too many times
I just yearn for the girl
Whoever she may be
Look at me
Again and again and
Again I see
How full my life could be
With love

Of my special angels, (yeah)
Will i ever find a love?
Will i ever find the girl?
Alone
Without her help
I'd either slip and fall
Or play the fool
Not knowing what to do

All I need
Is someone to want me
To want my love
As well as give her love
To me

Snuggling close together
Will I ever find a love? (hey)
Will i ever find a girl?
Am I gon' find a love? (hey)

Another day has passed me by
So comes the night
No one to hold me tight
Comes six o-clock
The alarm rings
A new day begins
Like yesterday
Or any other day
Oh please

Let this be the day
Will I ever find a love? (aah)
Will I ever find that girl?

You see I've been lookin' everywhere
And I got to find somebody
I need somebody
Who gon' understand (aah)
I got to find a love
I got to find a girl
Will I ever find love?

// So Very Hard To Go //

Ain't nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can do
I feel so bad, yeah
I feel so blue
I got to make it right
For everyone concerned
Even if it's me, if it means, just me
Wants getting back

'Cause I can never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, love
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so, so very hard to go

So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so

I knew the time would come
I'd have to pay for my mistake
I can't blame you for what you're doin' to me girl
Even though my heart aches

Your dreams have all come true
Just the way you planned them
So I'll just step aside, I'm going to step aside
And lend a helping hand

'Cause I can never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, love
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so very hard to go

So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so

I could never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, love
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so, so very hard to go

So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so
So very hard to go
It ain't easy to walk away when a man loves somebody
So very hard to go
Hey, hey...

For me to learn my lesson

Clean state

Clean slate
Hey ahhh
Clean slate

Clean slate

// Just Another Day //

Going through the day, sometimes lonely
Trying to find myself a thrill
Little do I know it might come to me
Hanging out my window sill

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat again, slowly drifting

Yes, I know my life is kind of strange
The thrill came down, but didn't last
Day by day the same old changes
Time seems to pass so fast

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat again, aimlessly drifting

Good and bad, it's supposed to be, full of
That's the way they always told me
Life is a wheel of many displays
Happiness will come in simple way

Dreaming that I'm drifting on clouds of satin
I ride them till I get my fill
I just got to worry 'bout the pace I'm keeping
Making sure I'm still for real

Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat hey, again, slowly drifting

Just another day [repeat]
