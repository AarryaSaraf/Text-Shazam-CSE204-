Album: Presence

// Achilles' Last Stand //

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head, with heavy feet, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, earth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
Ah, ah, ah

// For Your Life //

You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said, don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na yeah

Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh, oh, babe, damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

You want do it, you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it, do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life

// Royal Orleans //

One-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

A man I know went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers left and right
Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street, you know it's right
You can see my friend
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor burn
Doing up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out
Strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

One-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

// Nobody's Fault But Mine //

Oh, nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Devil. He taught me to roll
Devil. He taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

Nobody's fault but mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Brother. He showed me the gong
Brother. He showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to light

Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

Nobody's fault but mine

How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault

// Candy Store Rock //

Well
Oh baby baby, don't you want a man like me?
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes of blue
Oh baby baby, it's more than anybody else could do

Well
Oh baby baby, you know when I see you walking down the street
Oh baby baby, well you looking good enough to eat
Oh baby baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before
Oh baby baby, I want it now and every mouthful more of you

Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

Oh baby baby, you know that I wanted it more
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store
Oh baby baby, it ain't the wrapping that sells the goods
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you

Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

Ooh baby, oh
Baby it's alright, it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, it's alright

Well
Oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand

Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, yeah it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Alright

// Hots On For Nowhere //

I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So looked 'round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, now do it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
I lost my way
Hey babe, hey babe
I really really do now
Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm going to find it
Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?
Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so, feels so, feels so good

// Tea For One //

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
Oh, twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

Sitting, looking at the clock
Oh, time moves so slow
I've been watching for the hands to move
Until I just can't look no more

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seems to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way

To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
"Oh, baby, this one's for we two"
Which in the end is you anyway

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you, woman
And now I can't get back again

How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes seem to slip into days?
Well, well, well a minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way
I feel this way
