// Immigrant Song //

(2, 3, 4)

Ah! Ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah! Ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

// Friends //

Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
You got love, you ain't lonely
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

Mm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Mm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, it's very easy
It's very easy, it's easy, easy, yeah

// Celebration Day //

Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go

My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna dance and sing in celebration
We are in the promised land

She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell

My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna sing and dance in celebration
We are the promised land

There is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more. Yes, it has!
And if you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan, oh, yeah

If you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands

// Since I've Been Loving You //

Been working from seven
To eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling
How I love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl

But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could

I've been, I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now

Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

I said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them newfangled
Newfangled back-door men

I've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
To eleven, eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah yeah! It makes it a drag

Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, ooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind

// Out On The Tiles //

As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passing my way
Helps the rhythm move along

There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away

There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

I'm so glad I'm living
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man

One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go and people come
See my rider right by my side

It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be a race and the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Da da da da 70 more
All I do is say let's keep on
Gonna keep on moving on
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

// Gallows Pole //

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile
Friends, you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile
Brother, you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding many a mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad man
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many a mile, mile, mile

Oh yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She warmed my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah, yeah
Your brother brought me silver and your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole
Swinging on the gallows pole!
Swinging on the gallows pole!
Swinging on the gallows pole!
Swinging on the gallows pole
Pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah

Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha
It was swinging, it was swinging, it was swinging
Mamamamamamama, yeah
Uh yeah, uh yeah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha
Swinging on the gallows, yeah
Swinging on the gallows pole!
Swinging on the gallows pole!
Swinging on the, ah

See-saw Marjory daw
I gotta swing!
See-saw, knock at my door
I gotta sing
Keep on singing, yeah
Keep on spooling, yeah
Aw yeah!

// Tangerine //

One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain

Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

// That's The Way //

I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me?

That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

That's the way
That's the way it ought to be
Oh, don't you know now, mama said
That's the way it's going to stay, yeah

// Bron-Y-Aur Stomp //

Ah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

Well, if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah, can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

My, my
La la la
Come on now, it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed Merle
Come on now, well, let me tell you
What you're missing, messing 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name

// Hats Off To (Roy) Harper //

Mm, a, mm, a, mm, a mm, a mm, a come on down

When I done quit hollering, baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Get my babe, won't be late
You know by that I mean ah, seconds late
Ah, must I holler?
Must I shake 'em on down?

Well, I've done quit hollering, baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Well, I ain't no monkey

No brown-skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me
Yeah, I ain't no monkey

Well, I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Put in your nightshirt, mama

Must I holler?
Must I, must I, must I shake them on down?

Oh, I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
If that don't get her, I'm sure my shot, shot, shotgun will
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
Well, if that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shotgun will
I'm gonna go shoot her now

// Key To The Highway / Trouble In Mind //

I got the key to the highway, yeah
Billed out and bound to go
I gotta keep walking this highway
Walking most too slow

I eat my breakfast in California
I eat my dinner in Caroline
Woo I'm gonna keep on
Keep on walking this highway, yeah
'Til I reach the end of the line

Walk on, yeah

Show the movie, yeah
Lordy mama keeps on shining, shining
And the good, good, good Lord, heavens above
Everybody know, life ain't, ain't worth living
If you ain't with the one you love

So trouble in mind, yeah
Lordy mama, I'm blue, yeah
And I won't, I won't, I won't be blue always
Oh yeah, the sun gon' shine
Sun gonna shine in my backdoor
Some on rainy day, oh yeah
