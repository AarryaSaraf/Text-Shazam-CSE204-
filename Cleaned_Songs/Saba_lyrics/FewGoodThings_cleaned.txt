Album: FewGoodThings

// Free Samples //

[Cheflee:]
Been in a daze since the ink hit the seam now
I think it's time for me to play
My runnin' days read the moment of me now
I won't stop until I find a way home
The summer's gaze gives me a tingling ease now
Anticipate a veil of shade
But the shade is a gift from the tree now
I won't stop until I see the change I have made

[Saba:]
Damn, it's been a while since nights we saw you
Under the viaduct, if it's fire, run, run
To everybody that look like us
Who fam don't talk when they tired
There's more than what meets your eyelids
And live in the park just dyin' make you forget what you fight about
Plus what good is that flight? You ain't flyin' out your entire house
From Camry cars to the fancy, all without any dark kids in the train car
Hustlin' candy bars to play basketball
I still get nostalgic seein' houses that my family lost
They wished upon a star, I caught it like I'm Randy Moss
When granny fought for her property, she would turn down any cost
I'm the grandson of Carl who lived across from the fosters
Then fostered me to spread love through holiday poverty
Hand-me-downs I was given, I thought they were bought for me
A tale of two Chicagos, this gets confused commonly
'Cause one, you're commemorated if you're the hot commodity
I tried that invincible shit, but the principle is
When there's niggas defendin' your wig, then it's a pendulum shift
I tried to spend a lil' less like a minimalist
But then I can confess that this gets harder the bigger you get

// One Way Or Every Nigga With A Budget //

Want the peace, but don't wanna die
It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way

Need a million after taxes, I might spend the shit on fashion
All this flexin' made me stronger, feel like Tony in a mansion
My babymama lookin' she could've won a pageant
I'm not vegan, we been eatin', kick my feet up and get fatter
Sit all day and I play Madden and my mattress California
My address California, when I can't find my controller
I'm like "Fuck it", buy another, it ain't nothin', I got money
We all splurgin' on this dumb shit, 'cause we careless and we youngins
Every nigga with a budget takin' care at least ten buddies
What you need, you know I cover

It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way

I'ma order pasta that I cannot properly pronounce
Keep my doors open 'case a nigga pop up on my couch
Went from couldn't afford it, to a nigga coppin' without counting
None my checks been voidin' since a nigga got me an accountant
Send my mama a quick thousand and we crashed them open houses
All the rappers and Tarzana, in the valley, Calabasas
All my niggas wanna crash here, and my woman friends is ratchet
All my neighbors lookin' at us, lookin' different than they family
A black man with the baggies, so my people in my paddy Know I got it if you ask me

It's a one way street though
It's a round trip when we fly
Never one way, one way
New crib by the seaside
On the one way street though
There's a million ways to get by
Never one way, one way

// Survivor's Guilt //

Tell the story about-

Even in the wintertime they identifyin' all these niggas dyin'
Ain't no breakin' time for the bacon, swine
Is a peace of mind worth leavin' everything you knew behind?
Move another town and
Hope the trauma don't amount to what you do in life
'Cause some people didn't make it doin' life
Yeah, my people need vacation on a island
All the people sayin' we made it, sorta lyin'
I got no alliance to no corporate buyers
Raise the mortgage higher
I'm stand my ground like a fuckin' squatter
My father told me that the world was mine and I believed him
My momma said I was a heathen
My grandma was the one to feed us
I'm the one that paid my sister tuition, I should probably go to the meetings
My grandpa smilin' with no teeth in, my cousin still supposed to be h-
Ayy, ayy, ayy, raised below poverty
Now I keep it sacred geometry, I'm with my circle
I'm trainin' for mayhem, but y'all on more triangle
'Cause I saw silly niggas done change up
I'm still on my square like a plaintiff
Be careful, they armed and they dangerous
For diamonds some niggas is spirallin'
They wanna send boxes, but can't contain us, oh my God
I'm tryna move better, what's really eatin' when you from a food desert?
I see the news letters, can't listen to them, they be movin' too careless
This album's confessions of a man movin' quick, wonder he regret it
Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)

Even in the summertime it be mothers cryin'
Talkin' out of line, you get undermined
There's some real niggas here that wanna die
No stoppin', make as much as you can, it ain't no option
I'm all across the land, I'm a globetrotter
'Cause I left the fam on my old block
And now I got no choice but to go harder
I plotted on everything, said "I'ma kill everything"
Survivor's guilt rhetoric, I could've been a B
But that thinkin' deadly
We facin' the pressure of family that we watched suffer
I gotta lift 'em up out of the gutter
I make a check and send that to my mother
They root for me like Ireland and Conor McGregor
Loaded up the van, some of them didn't fit
I got you next time we do this again, don't trip
Had zero to my name, so did the gang I was with
Said, "Once we make ten bands, we'll be rich, rich, rich, rich"

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes
(Once I make a band and get rich, rich, rich, rich)
Uh

Bitch, I was rich at twenty-one
And I'm still on savage shit like 21
Havin' shit, Niemans and Saks, I'm grappin' it
Walk in, spend twenty K on the average
Real nigga straight off the block with the mills
Used to be broke and my partners on pills
Forty shots ran through the block, I couldn't hear
Spend that guap, now I got rocks in my ears
Stack it up, put up a lot for the kids
Some times you see, but that's not what it is
And when you see me, just acknowledge the G
I'm on top of my shit, 'cause I handle my biz
Stay on the grind, had to plot for some years
Ain't have no fear, I weren't droppin' no tears
Me and my old self we swappin' careers
I'm really lit, but I ride with a gliz
I can't break a sweat, gas up the jet and dip
Rainin', you get wet, I'm strapped, just check my hip
All this VVS, it needs baguettes, it cost a grip
I can tell she wet, she tryna sex me with her lips, swerve

Break in the door, 'nother day in the 'Go
I can't take it no more
Let the snakes do you cold
It's the same as before
If they hate, they some hoes

This came until my mother say "How would you like to come to Chicago and work for me?
And if you don't like it, I send you train fare to come back"

// An Interlude Called "Circus" //

Chillin' on the westside, everything was perfect
Back in 2012 before our record hit the surface
Had a few girls I was jugglin', I ain't ever did the circus
Had the phone by Motorola, but that bitch was out of service
My car go in and out like you tryna resuscitate it
Ayy, we on the way, but only fifty-fifty chance we make it
Ayy, we never say "Goodbye", no "See you 'round", no "See you later"
Ayy, this Chicago, when you leave, we say be safe here (This Chicago, nigga)

'Bout time, I think it's 'bout time
Back then, we didn't abide by
Now I tend to spend my time (Time flies), I think about us
Chillin' on the, uh, yeah, everything was perfect
All the small things about bein' broke I never got to notice
I took everything for granted when the moment was slow motion
Got into a fender bender, whip so broken, it was totaled
Not to sound like I don't appreciate what they pay me
But all the days in the basement, we tryin' to recreate it
Was eyein' a freaky lady from my high school, now she hoein'
She lookin' at how he glow up, fifty-fifty chance she goin'

Chillin' on the westside, everything was perfect
Back in 2012 before our record hit the surface
Had a few girls I was jugglin', I ain't ever did the circus
Had the phone by Motorola, but- (Blink, motherfucker)
My car go in and out like you tryna resuscitate it
Ayy, we on the way, but only fifty-fifty chance we make it
Ayy, we never say "Goodbye", no "See you 'round", no "See you later"
Ayy, this Chicago- (This Chicago, nigga)

// Fearmonger //

Okay the money on the way it'll lay by the first
Adolescence I would curse on the way to the church
My career just turned to cursive how I connect the words
Ain't grow up with much of shit but still it coulda been worse
He ain't focused on her pants he want get in her purse
I need it all in advance if they book me to work
From we barely had a chance left the crib on alert
To a crib with alarms and security perks
Insecurity hurts the same way jewelry works
So if you paying to flex, pay your security first
No point in paying for whips to ride a funeral hearse
We be prepared for the best but also fearing the worst

Okay every nigga that I know is scared of going broke
I know if I fall back down ain't no one there to lend me rope
Okay and every nigga that I know takes care of so and so
So ain't no option option option
You best go make more

Cause fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

When fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

And scared money never made money what I was taught
But once you make money you'll be more afraid than us all
My grandfather drove a corvette convertible car
He passed away and left his will to the fate of the stars
I made a cool mmmmm all for saying a bar
I was scared to spend a dime like what if I die tomorrow
Would my fam intervene for a bag of the g's
In a black model 3 sheesh passenger seat
Would my fans leave if I can't put asses in seats
If I log out an app or I lack a retweet
I'm just scared to go back didn't have shit to eat
Half my bread go to taxes the actual thieves

Okay every nigga that I know is scared of going broke
I know if I fall back down ain't no one there to lend me rope
Okay and every nigga that I know takes care of so and so
So ain't no option option option
You best go make more

Cause fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

When fearmonger live amongst us
I feel hunger hunger but guess
I feel something at least
I need something to eat

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

I'm dropping pounds
I hear my stomach growl

Yes fearmonger lurk among us
I done clawed my way up
But that bottoms callin me down
Slip and I'll drown

// Come My Way //

Daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money

Uh, yeah

This sound like tube socks on Madison Ave
Students actin' bad up in the class
Drop out but family will ask
Lie like you plan on going back, ayy
We ain't no time to relax
Work the only priority in tact
Posted on the porch shootin' the shit
Had to run them niggas shootin' shit
I wish that the guys had shields
Stop lights cleaning windshields
Fiends will do it free for a feel
Had the same friends since I was little
Used to hoop with Poppy and Jaleel
Spooky bent the block, I dropped a tape
Talked to Walt and watched him fly away
Multiply my problems by the day
Westside chillin' with a faithful
Knock it out the park it's like the base loaded
I'ma get it booming like I'm Metro
Me I'm getting to it how I'm meant to
Blood, I mean a vessel
I'ma tell them to be careful 'cause a copper wanna kill 'em
And the family in the ghetto
From the bottom of the barrel, I'ma run it like the pharoah
Nigga this is for the peasants, we be worried bout the peso, peso

Daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good
And then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money

[Krayzie Bone:]
Kray type love grindin' hard, so really I'll be fine
Shinin', ballin' 'til the end of my time
Stuck in my prime, I'm always at my best
Sick in the mind, go all day ,never rest
Keep 'em in line, the flow got 'em in check
Me and mine, you niggas gotta respect
Leisure time, for me that don't exist
I seek to find my peace, so a nigga drift sometime
Never no worry from me 'cause I'm knowin' that I'm truly blessed
Caution my steps, if I see majority go to the right then I walk to the left, ayy
Truly innovative, even niggas that be hatin' they be motivated
Cause I'm so creative, motivator
And them suckers we could never relate to
Trust no faker, shakin' these snakes
Ain't no haters making me wait
All I gotta say is they gon see me shine
They gon' have to bottle Kray
Ooh, don't come around my way
Bone Diggy done, yep, we go over time (Over time)

// Still //

[6LACK:]
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spendin' per diem
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them
I'm still, our life is like a film, set in a different realm
I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to-

[Saba:]
She say "I gotta be still, yeah, I gotta be still"
Bare a cross right 'cause when life goin' right then they might wanna re-deal
I say "I wanna be here", but I got moves to make
There's so many people workin' for me nowadays
That I don't even know who I pay, okay
I'm still right here beside you, gettin' sick of the costume
What's the real world?
When you with me, you take off your cool
Admittedly, yeah, I do too
I know I'm more illusive, but her grip never get looser
And that's why I don't wan' lose her
Ridin' 'round two-ninety, windows down
I get reminded to slow down
I get a message, we up now
She without [?]
I try to be profound, but you would get lost for me
I had to leave and put it on hold until you across for me again

[6LACK:]
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy
Still can't believe this is all real
Still spendin' per diem
Still lovin' these hoes, I still don't really need them

I'm still tryna decide how I feel
I'm still rough as a rider, I'm still right here beside you
I'm still tryna find a beat to kill

[Smino:]
High (High-high-high), high (High)
High (Just as still)
High (High-high-high), high (High)
High (Just as still)
High (High-high-high), high (High)
High
Uh-uh-uh, mm-mm

I hope you still got, hope you still got
And you still got my hoodie
Still have my car, still have my wallet
Still in that pocket, hope you don't call it
Pullin' my card, still where your momma live
Right off Parker road it's-
Still be callin' to me, she love me still
Got a bond still, so what's fuckin' real?
Discussion still, if there's somethin' still
Love a women still, got my gun inside of the function
Still-I am Shakespeare, no eraser, I wrote this verse in stone
Sculped the horoscope, I'm morse code, still tapped in with your hoe (With your hoe)
Smino touch the soul (Soul)
I change actually when I'm in the booth
I eat it like baba ghanoush
Right by the lanes and right by the goose
I'm really just still into you

[6LACK:]
Still missin' my lady, still smokin' like crazy

[Outro:]
My mother's house, the glue that kept the family together
There's nothin' like y'all
People moved out of the city and the compact got vacated
We were always loved more than...
Half an hour from the house [?]

// A Simpler Time //

[Saba:]
Woke up today, said, "I'm gettin' it right" (Yeah)
Been up some days and I been up some nights (Some nights, some days)
I got the plan and I didn't look twice
All for the simplest life (Simple life)

Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot
Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot

She say the little things matter, they show her she needed
If you can provide 'em, then she won't be leavin'
The man of my family, can't be no teachers
You learn what you see, and no, we didn't see it
Money can't be the security for her
But it's important even if you poor
White picket fence and a wreath on the door
We from the basement, concretes on the floor
Concrete on the deck
With a rim, I'm callin' check
In the simple autumn weather, give my daughter all that's left
When her father laid to rest
The money never made me, I'm more than I invest
In the mornin', I'm a mess
But wakin' up next to (You)
Makes it worth it (Yeah)
Said, I put in more effort (Yeah)
Shit, I can't be perfect, but I

Woke up today, said, "I'm gettin' it right" (Yeah)
Been up some days and I been up some nights (Some nights, some days)
I got the plan and I didn't look twice
All for the simplest life (Simple life)
I put the pain in this shit, did it right
Thank you for straight, gotta give it some time (Some nights, some days)
Hop off the train at the end of the light
That was a simpler time (Simple time)

[Mereba:]
Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot
Doot-doot, doot-doot
Doot, doot

Thank the sky for slowin' time, shit got too complicated
Pace myself, the paper swells, I'm patient, not complacent
Calm like the sea when it meets the horizon, no
No one can, no one can shake me, not even Poseidon, no
Live long and sing my song, so Black and free
That's all I really want this life to be
Green trees blossom 'round my seeds
With green stashed with the lock and key (Yeah)
Wouldn't that be perfect?
If the world ran on fulfilled purpose
And all persons worked like they purchases
Fillin' purses of wealthy serpents
Kneel down and look up, fillin' up the place of worship
Prayin' for days that hurt less
Karma come break the curses
Maybe that's what my worth is
Paint a new picture perfect

[Saba:]
Woke up today, said, "I'm gettin' it right" (Yeah)

// Soldier //

[Frsh Waters:]
Is this caution a cause?
It's justified in my eyes, sometimes I got God
But other times, other times, we feel like
We wanna let our guards down
That's not how to survive
Never ending cycle of life
Most times, we on guard

[Saba:]
Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the soldiers

I hope the world learn a value, the life of my unborn, yeah
'Cause what I'ma tell them when the time get here
I'm dyin' from asphyxiation from the weight of the world
While in the waitin' room, waitin' for the birth of my girl
How I'ma be a troop tryna lead a troop of my own?
You know what they do to a home?
That's why I bought this here chrome
Don't need an automatic, not Paula Patton
But two guns, yeah, I thought about it
We caught a cab and like a rally
We drove it through the rain while my girl is in pain
It's not impossible to think that we just made a mistake
'Cause to play the part of father is a sacred art to toddlers
City made a mark upon us, I'ma say that I'm a father
All I can do is pray that they don't make me an example
'Cause safety is something that is not here like a bantu
It's like I'm drafted and I gotta leave the family
I'm just hopin' I return with all my body parts attached to me
Yeah, exactly

Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the s-
(Live as a man, we die out a soldier)

[Joseph Chilliams:]
I know I'm poor, but I don't wanna go to war
The whole mission, I'll just miss mi amor
In trenches amongst henchmen and gore
Callin' for the Lord like a slave with a sword
Watchin' my back like my ass gettin' fat
Told recruiters right before they shoot us
That I can't differentiate between blue and black
So I conduct a draft and remain intact
In camouflage, I'll still be a snack
Be a star in the desert, like the Bible
Like beautiful girls that have dudes suicidal
They can't shoot me, they tryna shoot they shot
Fuck a bullet and a rifle, and it's too hot
Just imagine when the gun let
Off in the crossfire, more than one death
Scope on my curves like I'm in a sundress
Drones follow me around after sunset
I'm gettin' hunted

[Saba:]
Life is fighting while nobody notices
Die a man or live out like the soldiers
Life is filled with answers that make no sense
Live a man or die out like the soldiers

[MFnMelo:]
Forgive me, I only meant well
Still fighting every day with myself
Through the land of the fallen while you wait
Awake by the morning, someone prayed
I was told to soak it all in like sun rays
But the sun's like a grenade

[Saba:]
If all of this can go bad
Then what's the point of tryin'? (Ooh)
Go bad
Then what's the point of it?
If all of this can go-

// If I Had A Dollar //

[Saba:]
If I had a dollar every time I failed, I'd be a rich nigga
Money that don't mean wealth, that just mean rich, nigga
Look at that soul on sale, make you rich nigga
Dollar all the time I fail
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time

If I had a dollar all the times I failed, I'd be a rich nigga
Money that don't mean wealth, that just mean rich, nigga
Look at that soul on sale, make you rich nigga
Dollar every time I failed
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time

Readin' the words of a few good men
Childhood ways take the food out ya hand
Long live the gang, got the crew down a man
Microscope to the moves that you made
Enough flavor without fruit
Hop up out the bitch, I'm Biggie Smalls, give me the loot
They passed you the ball, and you caused them to loose
It was all on you
I can't even count all the shots I missed
That Nick Anderson, you'll be scared to shoot
But I can't call it, it is what it is
Broke niggas love to break shit as a kid
If I had a dollar every time I did fail
Nigga, I'd be rich (Rich, rich)

If I had a dollar every time I failed, I'd be a rich nigga (Let's go)
Money that don't mean wealth, that just mean rich, nigga (Let's go)
Look at that soul on sale, make you rich nigga (Let's go)
Dollar all the time I failed
If I had a dollar all the times I failed, I'd be a rich nigga
Money that don't mean wealth, that just mean rich, nigga
Look at that soul on sale, make you rich nigga
Dollar every time I failed
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time
Take a loss, take a win, take a breath
Take it in, take your time

[Benjamin Earl Turner:]
Ayy, still with the gang I had learned to get bands with
Remember when we played our records, the record executives pressing skip
Guess it's just they couldn't download the messages
Niggas just ain't have the bandwidth, damn, nigga
If I had a dollar every time I failed, I could pay a rich nigga ransom
I could pay and make this the national anthem
I had all these bags like a Badu ballad
Now we makin' bags off the word salad
Had to master patience, like I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Had all them Ls, and my green turned to a purple haze
And the future days lookin' hella clouded
Fail like an angel God doubted it
Prevailing against any odd, count it
I'm rich, rich

// Stop That //

Today some feelings are leavin'
Couldn't help but feelin' mistreated
They sleep on my shit and then tell me to drop
I don't see the reason
My missus run shit like a chief, together we gettin' mischievous
The bottom is way lonelier than the top, but these niggas ain't seen it
Stop that, stop it please
You more concerned what others earn that says a lot to me
I turned a million down a million times, that's not a lot to me
The game is changin', I do the best that I can to attain it
If we gotta gamble, I bet on myself, all that other shit dangerous
I just made a way for myself from out west and my grandmama basement
So I think you hoe niggas should bow in the presence of greatness
Let's go

Woah (Woah), woah (Woah), woah (Woah)
Woah (Woah), woah (Woah), woah (Woah)
Woah (Woah), woah (Woah), woah (Woah)
Stop that, stop it please
Stop that, stop it please

We talking 'bout generational wealth
The pressure I built for myself
For all of the people who pics on my grandmama shelf
Who heard her say "Give me the belt"
I would imagine one day, call it manifestation, a man would get taken away
We wasn't plannin' vacation, like internet bandwidth was laggin'
This feel like it's back in day
Shit is all ours like a captain would say
Treasure map is a trap and this rap is a raft
'Til you back on the ave, it's a matter a fact
That you gotta protect your neck like a giraffe
While the calendar countin' the days
The days only count if it's cash
When you hit the mattress imagine a mansion
I feel like I'm a mad man amassed in the vein livin'
I'm pretendin' I'm thankful at Thanksgiving
I just bought a chain you can't change niggas
I see all my potential in pain dealin'
With the weight of success and it taste bitter
Sweet I mean, you far from your kin
You not one of them to them to dim
You're light and get grim like a gremlin
It is what it is, until feelings switch and then it's

Woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy)
Woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy)
Woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy), woah (Ayy)
Stop that, stop it please, stop that, stop it please

[Intro:]
It's your mother, call me back when you can, talk to you, bye-bye
Hey, it's your mother, call me when you get a chance
Talk to you later, love you, bye
Hey, you, call your mother as soon as you can, bye, love you, yeah

[Saba:]
I got everything I could ever need
And I try to keep that in mind anytime I meet a man tryna sell a dream
It ain't no one tellin' me what to sing (No)
And the people around me got better things
To do with they life then tellin' me what I should do in a rhyme
Instead of being with my family, I was in Canada, I was in Tokyo
I didn't know before I learned as much as I love to perform at the shows
It's the people close I gotta show it for
Just lost a friend to an overdose
Made me question what I'm even sober for
'Cause I used to think that I was scared to die, but I don't even know no more
Look ma, I made it, it's like we dreamed
Look ma, I made it, it's make believe
Your boy in the land of fancy house and my car don't got a key
Some people I want to be proud of me (Yeah)
And walk on this earth and that shatters me (Yeah)
But I learned to imagine things so I feel it when they lookin' after me (Yeah)
My heart used to be filled with jealousy for what others had, amongst other things
And then when y'all sit in the same room, you realize they ain't what they seem
Yeah, uh

Look ma, I made it, it's like we dreamed
Look ma, I made it, it's make believe
'Cause Black boys on this side of town not supposed to be on the front page of the newspaper (Newspaper)
For doin' greater (Doin' greater)
I spent a lot of time wonderin' who will save us
It's food on the table, I'm grateful, I don't give a fuck 'bout a label
Yeah, they put a mill' on the table but my granny really put meals on the table

Westside right on time
We can play make believe just like we did when we were five
Save those looks for a desperate time
Do what feels right
Do what, do what (Yeah)
Compliments don't get me high
Sometimes, I get overwhelmed and I feel I want to hide
Fall in love when you're forty-five
And now, do what feels right
Do what, do what

[Fousheé:]
I gotta grow into these shoes
I got a lot to lose now
I made all these things tangible
That's why I can't fuck with make believes
Too much pressure for me
Why I can't fuck with-
Why I can't fuck with-
Too much pressure for me (I can't fuck with-)
That's too much pressure on me
There's too much waste in the world (I can't fuck with-)
That's too much pressure on me
Why I can't fuck with-

// 2012 //

Yeah

Two students that had each other back in the world against 'em
Who barely showed up to class once they had each other's attention
I'm down to spend every minute that I can to her limit
'Cause usually she down to kick it until she get tired of niggas
Music's our common interest, we're ramblin' about Kendrick and Kid Cudi
I'm tryna put her onto shit that she missin'
But she had everything, I mean everything I was listing
So I even gave her my tapes in hope she would try to listen
The kind of bond where it get hard not to fall in your feelings
But she talkin' 'bout friendship (What?)
A similar commute, we on the same side of town
And her school close to my campus
So when I get off the bus, it's fuck it, I'm 'bout to go down there
I've always struggled to converse if it wasn't a verse
Social anxiety, it got me stumblin' on words
But I always speak my mind and shit when I'm with her (Yeah)

Yeah, uh, corner store to the Porsche with my new thing
Yeah, my new thing, yeah, uh, yeah
We'll get lost in the world like we're wanted
Hey, you know me, ayy, yeah
Uh, corner store, can't afford shit but your chips
Hey, the choices, hey, uh, uh
We don't gotta mature, we're just young kids
Ayy, so fuck them

I had everything I needed, everything
Yeah, I had everything I needed, everything

Yeah, my niggas that had each other back in the world against 'em
From a poverty stricken parable that our hearts had written
We come from fifty-cent bags of candy and penny pitchin'
It's like a wishin' well if we gave the concrete our wishes
We dreamt so loudly, we would wear it when the sun would slow up
On the grayest day we on the train in our colorful clothin'
A child-like innocence, we cherished it and tried to hold it
We was either askin' 'bout performances or where the hoes was
My granny basement became the Mecca like Eric Foreman's
The cushion in my uncle couch fell out, but we still on it
Shit, if you ever need a place to stay you can sleepover
If not, it's back to CTA, I'll catch y'all in the mornin'
The green line's dangerous, for us it's just how we get home
I wanted dreads, I put the brush down and I grabbed a comb
I can take you where it's rough, I mean the catacomb
All these bodies droppin' same blocks that we played tag
For some old shit, they wanted they payback
So we escape it all in the booth with the playback
'Cause this the only place that we knew you were safe at

Yeah, uh, corner store to the Porsche with my new thing
Yeah, my new thing, yeah, uh, yeah
We'll get lost in the world like we're wanted
Hey, you know me, ayy, yeah
Uh, corner store, can't afford shit but your chips
Hey, the choices, hey, uh, uh
We don't gotta mature, we're just young kids
Ayy, so fuck them

I had everything I needed, everything
Yeah, I had everything I needed, everything
Said I had everything I needed, everything
'Cause I had everyone I needed

// Few Good Things //

[Saba:]
I put the punch in the kick instead of punchin' a clock
It's no wonder that this is timeless
Nights spent sleepin' on the floor, need a bed or at least a cot
Since his dreams startin' to define him
The grind never stopped for the workin' class, fuck a Birkin bag
I learned my colors, then I had to watch what color shirt I had
Like a concierge, I show the way of our concernin' past
But everybody can't come along, I come to terms with that
I ain't never been one to burn bridges or burn a bag
Ironic, money turn a man into an island
And a friend into a financial advisor
Take a family and divide it in America, the land of the tyrant
Still with the same niggas, and that mean the women too
The only thing change what I paid for the tennis shoe
Like Eminem on the stage 'fore he blew, this is livin' proof
Bad things come in threes, good things come, a few
Yeah, few

All the fears we had to run from
And he only want a few things
We went back to where we start from
Not the only one
All the fears we had to run from
And he only want a few things
We went back to where we start from
Not the only one

Niggas reppin' blocks like the taxi wars
But the thing about turf is that it never actually grows
I tried to focus on the sprouts like a grocery store
But in the hood, shit don't always go how it's supposed to go
So we adjusted like a tailor makin' alterations
Altercations in a Austin neighborhood was all for paper
Group think swear that it was all contagious how we all complacent
I said, "Fuck it, I'm all in" like I was off to Vegas
The followed days, I grew my dreads like I was part Jamaican
Know the journey waitin' is a lonely one, they'll call him crazy
Because believin' in yourself not often celebrated
People projectin' a mirror image that is merely hatred
The fear he faces is the same as me, I'm peer adjacent
All truth, you know I don't lie like Shakira shakin'
Iridescent people show they colors, I assume they true
Bad things come in threes, good things comin' soon
Few

And he only want a few things

All the fears we had to run from
And he only want a few things
We went back to where we start from
Not the only one
All the fears we had to run from
And he only want a few things
We went back to where we start from
Not the only one

[Black Thought:]
From what we knew about my mother
She was cut from the cloth of South Carolina Gullah
She knew to keep the root a right amount of color
Her old soul remind you of somebody abuelas
It's smooth the way she dip into her mental capoeira
When she starin' into your soul and you tryin' not to let her
Now and then you might get a word if not a operetta
When she take it upon herself to drop a acapella 'bout
Different rules, relatives you can't pick and choose
How they quick to get confused and then disapprove
Grown actin' like they still in school
But in the grand scheme of things, it all seems pretty minuscule
A cool toast to the people we adore the most
Let's hold 'em close like the water headed for the coast
I'm wide awoke, what I'm haunted by is more than ghosts
It's when you slip and sippin' a mornin' roast
Listenin' to Hall and Oates, oyster flex on a ashy wrist
As I reflect on what got me this
How I'm one of Cassie kids, we from S.P. and we come in twos
I'm unenthused, but good things come in fews

[Saba:]
I tried that invincible shit, but the principle is
When it's niggas defendin' your wig, then it's a pendulum shift
I tried to spend a little less like a minimalist
But then I can confess that this gets harder the bigger you get
The rich'll get rich, the poor get pissed, that's just what it is
We seen everything from the gutter to glitz
Adults in the crib tellin' they kids to cover they ears
Fight with a youngin and watch they older brothers appear
Like two in the front and one in the rear
The fun subsides when you gotta swallow your anger or stomach your fear
All the money a myth, it's a sunken abyss
But necessary for the family to have somewhere to live
So you stuck with makin' decisions more than some wouldn't get
The baggage that come with the bag, hope you not fumblin' it
Marathon, not a sprint, like I'm honorin' Nip
When commas the common denominator, all the percent
Got us movin' to the Pacific in hopes that it would be different
The boat we was on had physics that left some of us swimmin'
Don't ask 'bout my independence, we not financially literate
Dangle a million dollars when oxygen was the mission
We just wanna breathe, we been drownin' down here for centuries
Black and brown boy identity, families that depend on me
Art get turned to assembly line every line my lineage
Glass half full, the other half was the emptiness
We turned a bunch of nothing to abundance
Few good things

When- When- When uncle Eddie got married to auntie
He- He married my aunt
You have to tell the story
