Album: TheHealingComponent

// The Healing Component //

[Mick:] You wanna know about The Healing Component
[Woman:] No, I know, listen
[Mick:] I mean it's whatever. All you're doing is asking me about the healing component, so whatever you wanna say. Like I said I never explained it to you before either
[Woman:] You actually did but okay
[Mick:] You don't remember it?
[Woman:] Yes I do
[Mick:] Alright what's it about?
[Woman:] Alright so uh, what is The Healing Component?
[Mick:] Aw, you tell me

Lately a nigga been meditated
Probably overly medicated
But it's heaven sent, I'm not hesitating
No, I no longer have a problem with niggas who act like they've never hated
I mean at least you know now
And for those still looking at me sideways you gotta stop sleeping on the profile
Jawline let 'em know that I can take a punch
Still gotta beat 'em to the punch though
Started drinking water at the party, I ain't even gonna front
Seen him put something in the punch bowls
So many truths go untold
So much proof that something big's about to unfold on our asses
These boxes are premium and so are the mathematics
You don't have to add it, I'm a natural at it
Spread love, try to combat the sadness
Got loud to match this
Dose of reality, lit she hit like jabs from Cassius
These titans clashing
Baby you should grab some glasses
Check you a new perspective
Get a new directive
Fuck- Fucking up a check is a new collective
And they got it for the free screaming

THC, THC
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this THC, THC
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this water (for this water), for this truth (for this truth)
Tryna put some love into everything I do
Thanking you for this THC, THC, THC, THC

I'm not always talking marijuana when I'm referencing these trees (trees)
Always talking water but that's just the truth you gotta read between the lines
And got you sniffing coke off hundred dollar bills ('llar bills)
We sip the lean, we pop the pills (the pills)
Why everything that's supposed to be bad gotta be such a thrill
Why is praising mediocrity such a skill
It bothers me
When these niggas with moms below poverty lines
Get to play like they Socrates
I play like apostrophes
I mean I'm over the words unless they verbs
That's when we see curves like sundresses in June
The politicians addressing the youth
Talking the loudest and smoke in the booth
Show me the proof
Who puffing the love?
Who wrote up the truths?
He is what is figuratively we only smoke gas
Who rolled up the fruits?
No oops, just smoke 'em out
Brought the water had these niggas drowning and choking out
Tryna spread The Healing Component
This love through the culture now like

THC, THC
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this THC, THC
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this water (for this water), for this truth (for this truth)
Tryna put some love into everything I do
Thanking you for this THC, THC, THC, THC

See this had you, smoking on a regular, no
Regular I, know that [?]
And it'll to get you high (it'll to get you high)
It'll get you high it'll take you higher
This ain't what you smoking on a regular
Smoking on, smoking on a regular
This ain't what you smoking on a regular

You see it's really all love
And I never claimed all well my nigga we can put it in stone
And I ain't ever claimed all guilt but I know if it was me in that garden
I probably woulda let all hell loose too
Who knew that a young black man might just swoop through with a new roots crew
And the first time like moon walk
When you know you got something foolproof
Free love is THC and all this tree get wrapped in truth
I know

This ain't what you smoking on a regular
Smoking on a regular, smoking on a regular
This ain't what you smoking on a regular

[Mick:] When people talk about love you really only think about the, the pretty parts, the romantic parts of love people don't think about things like loving themselves and what that takes. And that you have to know yourself to love yourself and how difficult of a battle that may be. Uh, I don't think everybody even agrees on what love is or what love looks like, whether it be in the street or personally. Um, and, that's just a conversation that needs to be had and that's just what I wanna do, is start a conversation

I think it's- it's- it's setting myself up to be able to have a lot to talk about and different angles to come from. Uh, musically and lyrically and, and from a point of story telling and, and I think it's just something that we need a lot more of anyway. Whether it be just a conversation or actual acts of love you know what I'm saying? Just starting a conversation about...

// Spread Love //

South, south, south, south, south, south side, south side, south side
Spread love, spread love, spread love (south side, souths side, south side)
South side
Inside, outside, up, right, down

Southside 'round 91st and Cottage Grove
I done seen a lot of failure, still I found myself a lot of goals
Watson gate was where I found myself
I started using lead to harness gold
It's way easier to smile, let your local hatin' ass nigga know
Learning patience fast, sippin' slow
All this water in me, I've been water bendin' on the southern side of the 'go
I got martyrs with me, ship is charter
We've been on a mission, lowkey expedition
Using intuition, losing inhibition just to give
We're only inches through the door
To put you on some shit you didn't know
This ain't no poser shit, on some Moses shit
You can see us swimming through the floor
See, I done told you this but gotta show you this
You know actions do a little more
I quit the fantasies and started planting seeds
Tryna usher in a little growth
My nigga we been on our way up, I won't say a lay up
But love is easier than what they show
You should know

And they be asking, "what do love got to do with the point?"
It's the soothe in your water, it's the truth in your joint
All that gold is overrated
What do you do with your coin?
We gon' try do spread some love with it
Spread some love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need? (Buyin' water...by the jug, I'm the plug, baby, Buyin' water...by the jug, I'm the plug baby)
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love

Cause what a nigga really got to say to me, huh?
I just let my little light shine
I guess that's why they wanna throw shade at me, huh?
Cause we'll say, "I love you" and never show that shit
That ain't okay with me, try to spread love on the daily
And the record like I got a AK with me
I bet the hater shit don't take you far
Breathe, stress, shake, let it all go like Mase for me
I brought the water in a mason jar
I'm trynna build, that's masonry in the literal sense
Some people got a literal fence around they heart
Mine's on my sleeve and I'm out here sleeveless
I ain't finna plead with these niggas to fuck with me
I keep it a buck fifty
Tryna follow in the footsteps of Jesus
Hopin' you can keep up with me

The basics of his message was love, the basics just loving yourself and projecting that love onto others
Treat the nice man like a brother
And I know it's love if you know his words
Then you know it's God

And they be asking, "what do love got to do with the point?"
It's the soothe in your water, it's the truth in your joint
All that gold is overrated
What do you do with your coin?
We gon' try do spread some love with it
Spread some love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love

// Daniel's Bloom //

Yea, it was right off 79
Real niggas would roam the halls
It was Hirsch High
It was bankin' on your withdrawal
I was shellshocked
Donatello, I'm stickin' to it like a bail hop
Brought the baggage
I'm siftin' through it, tryna track the real
Love heals, I lean on it
Come and crack a seal
Crack the 5 right up the middle
It was stonecold
That was jokes
A couple blocks, was just a stone's throw away from the folks
It was at war, I hit the peace pipe
That just means I had no protection
I was stressin' way more often if correct with
Recollectin' it was all well, or on Larry
On sight, and I was all love, but arms ready
It's all my life I had to stay low
No chance for a nigga to save peso
Or slow dance with death or hate
They like the same so I'm off that
On point
These youngins aimin' at your ball cap, for some coins
They say it ain't no love

Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
MoÃ«t, we pour it up at gatherings that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
Love is what flowers and finish blooms begin
Show me your plot and I'll do the dirt till my wounds submit

Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet

Don't let the struggle make your heart harder
Sip the truth, spit the truth
That's the smart water
I'm talkin' gospel, J Hova, no Shawn Carter
It's more cons than pros
The Southside so cold
I suggest your keep your Carhartt
Love is stronger than pride
But also love is a muscle
You gotta build from inside
And amidst the hustle and bustle
Amidst the roll of the thunder
I play the role of a Russell Westbrook or Simmons
Put simply, I gotta get it and they couldn't kill me morally
Either way Free Nation got a couple more of me on deck
Young Nyjah Huston did the street trials
Kicked and pushed until I beat down barriers
Kicked and pushed until I beat down
They say it ain't no love, but I've seen it, I've seen it
They come few and far between it
But I've seen it, I've seen it, I've seen it

Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
MoÃ«t, we pour it up and got the best that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
Love is what flowers and finish blooms begin
Show me your plot and I'll do the dirt till my wounds submit

// Strange Love //

[Woman:] So is there only one healing component, which is love?

[Mick:] Yeah I think...you know, like I said that's what Jesus was down here to show us, that is literally what he showed us, like that's what- what his purpose was on this Earth. Umm, spread love and spread God's message and, and...eventually his love for us is what led him to die on the cross

Was never here to lessen your glow
I wanna see it intensified
I wanna see my niggas learning lessons and attempting to grow
I see my cousin whip get hit from the side, they swiss cheesed it
In a swift moment most niggas would misread it as well
When your dealings not as well as you've been meaning to tell
Can't tell me nothing fam, I've seen it myself
Walked away from niggas needed my help
I mean how I'ma give you what I clearly still need for myself?
Underwater tryna breathe for myself
Going deep so the pressure is massive
Really tryna be a saint, but I ain't Drew Brees I never been that passive
Always been this pensive
Niggas claiming that I'm changing cause my clothes ain't always been expensive
Always been eccentric
Never been as fake as but it came to extensions
The poems always been extensive
See this story hasn't yet been stenciled
Or adapted to some whack ass Tyler Perry minstrel movie
I detest the pretentious bougie
Motherfuckers whose presence I digest like meat
I'm vegetarian let's digress to some shit that move me
Tell shawty if we kick it then I'm just like Kangol
Girl I'm at your kufi
Introspective questions, hope you ain't no goofy
What you think about the black man?
Tell me what you know about love
Ain't no right or wrong answer
I just know we could go deeper it's a story, every stanza
Gotta speak in allegory, spread love the new mantra
It's the healing component, it's the healing component
It's the life for the evils like a fucking patronus
Standing banded with my brothers, black Nicholas Jonas
Fuck my last name them hoes used to own us
No weapon formed against me, please don't even walk up on us
Dunkin Donuts in my coffee cause I been smelled the Folger's
I just walked in on you bitch, smell the doja
What's the basis? All these racist motherfuckers out here raping the culture
On the lowest of keys, they sowing hate for ourselves then throw bait
To kill and appropriate, they vultures
Ain't immune to reproach
Have your fucking hands up if you choose to approach us
Fuck around with the fuck around, we still might shoot

Dr. Strangelove
We claim that we love our sisters
That's some strange love, Dr. Strangelove
We claim that we love ourselves
That's some strange love, Dr. Strange
Don't go insane, love, no shit's insane love
I feel your pain
We claim that we love our sisters
That's some strange love, Dr. Strangelove
We claim that we love ourselves
That's some strange love, Dr. Strange
Don't go insane, love, no shit's insane love
I feel your pain

So please don't lose the love we made
So please don't lose the love we made
Don't fade away, don't fade away, don't fade away
Don't fade away, don't fade away, don't fade away

How could a black man not be confused in this?
Used to hang from them trees, we abusing them now
Sons and our daughters used to follow in the footsteps of our fathers
But we losing them now
On our own, scene of Lackawanna Blues for him
How society not bruise your mental?
Both claim Jesus, we Jews and gentiles
I cruise at two miles an hour
I hope everybody gets to see the love

So please don't lose the love we made
So please don't lose the love we made
Don't fade away, don't fade away, don't fade away
Don't fade away, don't fade away, don't fade away

Dr. s
Dr. s
Dr. s
Dr. Strangelove
We claim, we claim that we love ourselves
We cl- That's some, that's some strange love, Dr. S
Doc-Doc-Doctor Strange
Don't go, Don't go insane, love
No sh- no shit's insane, no sh- no shit's insane
Doc-Doc-Doc-Doctor Strangelove
Dr. s Dr. Strangelove
We claim, we claim, we claim that we, that's some strange
We, we claim that we love ourselves

[Woman:] Never changing, despite if he gets on your nerves or not. Despite if she, you know, doin' that time, or not. And she's just getting on your nerves. It's unconditional, and never ever changes. If I say I love you that means I'm gonna love you forever, that's just, that's something you have to equate with forever. Never change it...

// This Type Love? //

[Woman:] Do you think there are like different ways to well, obviously there's different ways to love someone but have you ever..., I know you been in more than one relationship
[Mick:] But are-...
[Woman:] Do you feel like you loved someone different than someone else?
[Mick:] I was about to say, but are there different ways to love someone? My friends but I borderline would, I probably would do it for them too. You know what I'm saying? Like, it is...I don't...and I would do it for y-, for-...I would have done that for Kendra, you know what I'm saying? I would do- do it... I would do it for someone I wanna do it for, like I would...you know what I'm saying? Like, it's not really...Then there's things that like I wouldn't do..you know what I'm saying? That I would do for you. So- so- so- so-...but I just feel like if I got love for you, I got, I got love for you like it's thorough. You know what I'm saying? But..
[Woman:] Okay but
[Mick:]I guess there's levels, there's definitely levels
[Woman:] But, so still like back to the ...the original question, like have you, okay have you been in love more than once? [Mick:] Romantically?
[Woman:] Yeah
[Mick:] F-, Yeah
[Woman:] So...in any of those situations do you feel like you've loved one person different than the other?
[Mick:] No. Damn now that I'm thinking bout it, I guess I was more on fire in my last relationship like...for sure. I was definitely way more, yeah I guess I loved her diff- diff- diff- diff- diff- for sure. I never really think-, I, that's what I'm saying  I don't really think about it like that so I, my first reaction is to be like m-m-m
[Woman:] Yeah I don't...and it's not like a, I'm true, like it's a choice for you
[Mick:] That's what it makes it seem like
[Woman:] Yeah, no, it's not a choice for you to love someone differently but, I feel like, the right person can make you...feel different than you've ever felt with anybody else and so you...essentially you, you love them different

[Mick:]
I don't know that sounds weird to me

// Drowning //

We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't (sound right)...

I was high and I was startin' to lose focus
Then I stumbled in the water, I was trippin', I was chokin'
I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started floatin' way out in the open
'fore I knew it I was driftin' in the middle of the ocean
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started whalin', started flailin'
I was splashing, waves crashing all around me
Felt the passion of the water
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, that don't sound right
Just wait, one second, that don't sound right

Dial tone on my hotline, it don't bling much
Sing songs like Tubman
Young Stephen Morris, I ain't seen much
Just a couple motherfuckers tryna rape the culture
Tell the vultures I don't need lunch
It's like morse code
Gotta be in touch to communicate it to the people
Love heals all
Best get your immunization, that THC
So we smoking in here like we fumigating
For the fuckboys too much truth in me
I don't trust niggas
I ain't preaching at you
I don't touch boys
Brought the baggage with me
Like a bus boy I don't need tips
You could see mines
Rap Genius, you could read mines
In between lines
Yeah they act genius but the way society is set up
Almost like they read minds
You heard Alchemy, boy I'm Magneto
They can't read mines
Niggas bark loud
Talkin' revolution, when the waves come they turn feline
I been turnin' tricks
In the coldest part of the deepest water like a sealion, you could see why

We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, its a lituation
Won't we need the litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right? When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?
Wait, wait, that don't sound right
Just wait one second, that don't sound right

When the real, hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real, ohh hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown
When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown
I can't breathe I can't breathe no no no no no no no no no no no no auwwwww!
I was high and I was startin' to lose focus
Then I stumbled in the water, I was trippin', I was chokin'
Saying, I can't breathe
Yeah, I can't breathe (I can't breathe with this muhfuckin' flag round my neck)
Started floatin' way out in the open
'fore I knew it I was driftin' in the middle of the ocean
Saying, I can't breathe (I can't breathe with this muhfuckin' flag round my neck), Yeah, I can't breathe
Started whalin', started flailin'

// As Seen In Bethsaida //

You think I can love you like God love us?

[TheMIND:]
My eyes have never seen the sun
Guided by the light look how far we've come
Lost inside my mind I often wander (I often wander)
Don't quit your day job Dillon

[Mick Jenkins:]
And please don't lose the love
Niggas got heart, never use enough
I put mines on my sleeve, went sleeveless
Niggas say I'm nuts cause I bruise it up
I'm just like didn't you see Jesus?
I mean I, never really seen him either
But I kinda try to follow in his footsteps
All this weight on my chest, get it off with some good reps
Some good prayer, good stress
Good kush, good sex
I mean all that good shit nigga
All that good shit y'all be talking bullshit
Even on the pulpit
I see so much hating
The love ain't even appreciated these days
Niggas depreciated the value
Heard God's whisper then lowered the volume
Then popped him a Valium
So why wouldn't they be sleeping on my flow
I'm from south side Chicago
I know the mental
The self hate is really just incidental
Exposure is instrumental
In shedding that skin
Almost like it come with black skin
In fact every nigga that's in my faction
Had to unlearn
His spirit in our eyes
So we can see the lies
Never had to worry about sunburn though

[TheMIND:]
My eyes have never seen love
Guided by the light look how far we've come
Lost inside my mind I often wander (I often wander)
Don't quit your day job Dillon

[Mick Jenkins:]
Do it for the love
Please don't lose the love
Do it for the love, do it for the love
Please don't lose the love, please don't lose the love
Do it for the love, do it for the love

// Communicate //

You know what I'm saying like...it's not bad like, you know what I'm saying? Like she'll be tryna like...level the playing field all the time. I'm just like yo, reality is like, you not as stressed as me, you don't as much shit going on as me, you not as busy as me like...You don't understand how I feel, just because you have been stressed, just because you've been tired from work. And because there was that rift I could never really talk about it, like if I talked about it, it was... Cause the reality is you taking the L every time in so many different things in this relationship. Like we can't really plan for shit all the time

What I will, when I want, why I came
What I will, when I want, why I came
What I will, when I want, why I came
How you figure, who is you, Nardwuar or something?
You don't know shit about me

[Mick Jenkins:]
Yeah black man and that's everything it denotes
She want a nigga that can sing
But she only ever wanna hear the C-notes
Yeah said she know that shouldn't be a thing
Just a dream, I ain't never been a cheap ho
Yeah feeling on her body when we dance
I'm assuming her whole wardrobe probably Bespoke
Yeah cause it fits so tight
A silhouette in the disco lights
Call you bae
And I don't mean the San Francisco type
Lit cross, crisp pop in the light
And you smile and I swear that it gets so bright, right
Right, John Smoltz couldn't throw shade at you girl
And your black skirt been so tight, right
Gotta have a little cocaine in you girl you addicting
Nurse Joy can you fill my prescriptions?
Should I take drugs without your permission?
If you a sin I can't be a Christian
Listen to me tripping, I'm tripping

[Ravyn Lenae:]
Nothin' is nothin' why you act lone
Somethin' is somethin' why you stay at home all night?
Blunt in my hands and pick up your phone
Pop in we'll jump and follow me home tonight
When you know that breathe, he's so, he's, he's
Nah-nah-nah-nah
When you know that leaving makes me angry, angry, angry

[Mick Jenkins:]
So let my resonate, we can just talk
Look here you ain't got to hesitate under the stars
We can vibe, we can meditate
Bringing water, marijuana, we can medicate
So don't you hesitate
Why don't you ride with me
Got a boat for this water, take a ride with me
I've been waiting, I've been patient, I could slide on you
Slide on you girl, I'm with you, I'ma ride for you
Ride with you, I'ma ride, just vibe with me
Got a boat for this water, take a ride with me
I've been waiting, I've been patient, I could slide on you
Slide on you girl, I'm with you, I'ma ride for you
Ride with you, I'ma ride

[Rayvn Lenae:]
Are you down with me my love?
Are you down with me for sure?
Are you down with me for sure my love?
I want you to let me know

Nothin' is nothin' why you act lone
Somethin' is somethin' why you stay at home all night?
Blunt in my hands and pick up your phone
Pop in we'll jump and follow me home tonight
When you know that breath, he's so, he's, he's
Nah-nah-nah-nah
When you know that leaving makes me angry, angry, angry

I get you (right), I understand but it's like I need it (yeah, especially yeah). If every time you tryna like, make me feel guilty like I'm like (damn). You know what I'm saying? It's just like pshh (nah, that'll fuck you up for real)

// Plugged //

I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I, keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah), what they want yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need

The Parmesan ain't never been the problem
You'll probably miss the point if coin is all that's on your palate
Changed a whole lot
Shout to DJ Khaled and according to my calculations
They see us as half of Nathan
This one here is Black affirmation that we sunkissed
Fuck the fascination, that's the fuck shit
Forest Gump the culture, how you not gonna have the gumption to love yourself?
My nigga scream spread love at every function
And fuck all the assumptions about your nature
Never doubt, a hater's life is probably stressful
Learn from lessons, elevate your level
Nigga, burn through sessions assessin' myself
And my worth and my God and my devil, I never did Prada
I'm comin' at giants with pebbles
And praying three times a day
So nigga throw me with the lions or rebels
And I will eventually find a way
No mortal man could ever come take my kind away

I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I, keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah), what they want yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need

And that's just basics for you
If the alcohol gonna make you tell then truth, then let's get wasted (wasted, wasted, wasted)
If you want the truth from me, I got the water, you ain't even gotta taste it, do you?
And the basis is love, and this shit came straight from above
I know that you feel it, you know that it's love
I often wonder why he even chose us
His homie sold him out for the silver
It's beside the point but it wasn't even gold bruh
Still die for a nigga just like him, and I know a nigga just like him
And that ain't nothin' but love, that ain't nothin' but love

I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I, keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah), what they want yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need

// 1000 Xans //

[Mick Jenkins:]
I mean I'm only smoking weed because I'm stressing heavy
All this water in me
I just pray the Lord'll bless my levies
Lessons let me know I shouldn't be so careless
In some circles misconceptions make 'em think my inspiration herbal, it's not
I mean sometimes it is
I mean sometimes I'm tweaking and laughing 'til I hurt ribs
And then sometimes I'm speaking of passion and my purpose
Forever creeping until I'm peaking through valleys and skies
That's the heavens, I mean I'm trying to get high
Some claiming cloud 9's, I'm floating around 11s
Rose grown in the alley
No stems for the thorns
Cause those buds is from Cali
I'm thinking about it different than y'all
Poker face but I'm thinking appropriation wherever approached, with statements of how high I go
I mean the buzz could last a lightyear
And thinking all the time bout how they never let you shine
And leave you mindboggled
I played boggle at a young age
So a nigga know words
Met Mary when I got to know her
See we would flirt, it's on the daily now
Damn near made that girl my lady now
Without a nigga just might go too crazy
How it come to this, uh

[TheMIND:]
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched

[Mick Jenkins:]
1000 Xans'll make you sleep good
What you drinking, don't forget you gotta eat good
Cause food is a whole ass drug
I mean Ronald is a old ass plug
And he chopping rocks for cheap to keep your whole ass stuck
And the days is a fucking maze through the smoke screens
I'm amazed how we never gave, blowing smoke rings
For the pain tryna acclimate
Give a fuck bout accolades
Ginger for your shorty, treat the water like a cabernet cheese
At the fact that we see
How they lie to our faces and still we choose to believe
I've been exposed to new spaces, it's getting harder to breathe
The black Neo of this Matrix
Directing homeostasis
But still all my homies bleed
No pay phones it's getting harder to leave
Tobacco leaves, run the trees in the breeze these days
Rolling them shits with ease these days
Only thing that put greenSLLIME at ease these days
And they still claiming it's the easy way, yeah
Only thing that put greenSLLIME at ease these days
They still claiming it's the easy way

[TheMIND:]
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched

I've never been afraid of heights
I've never been afraid of lights
I've often got lost in flights drug induced
Fall asleep in mistransition, everyday I wake up wishin'
I can barely see the sun shine through
Cause it's the motherfucking...drugs

// Prosperity //

[TheMIND:]
Who's the most self conscious?
Lately I've been lookin' at tags less
Never leavin' store fronts bagless
Designer rags and conversations with facists
Mister Wilder's a myth, theMIND is a gift
I mean, so is this gift
No longer ashamed of my thread count
In bed with a girl who's not ashamed of her head gown
Still I wake up with these cold sweats
Forever get to sleep it off
Pray this woman fucks me soft
Instant gratification
I mean, now I'm impatient
It's hard for a nigga who never had shit to have shit
You turned into that store front, paper or plastic?
You asked for it
My dad says the Lord's blessings will rain down
I pray I stay sane now
Asking questions like, "Am I lame now?"
Because I'm still plagued by peer pressure
Craig says "survivor's guilt will probably still get ya"
Time spent is still like the only real measure
Of the four letter word
I drip my ego in gold
I wear that bitch like a fur
The only protection from the coast is the moments that I rather forget

[Mick Jenkins & TheMIND:]
Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
Best dressed, say less
When niggas stress it ain't true (Fuck, bro)
Cuban links and pinkie rings and trinkets
Diamonds, bling and gold, in my grill...grill...

[Mick Jenkins:]
Spread love
Fuck a dollar
Fuck your lover, get some head-love
Break bread with your niggas, burnin' bed bugs
Cause you don't need that
Fuck a zippy nigga feedback
We gone where the keys at
You see, I'm only ever lost when I ask where the trees at
Milly rockin' through the pressure
Middle fingers to the pessimistic
Niggas latchin' cause they simply missed the message, listen
All this gold I be talkin', what's it representin'?
If I ain't rockin' what I'm talkin'
What I'm talkin' really
Mostly metaphor
Most niggas out here talkin' silly
"We'll talk about it, Mick"
Lot of people like to dance around a point, I couldn't even bust a waltz around it
I've been tryna make one
See a chance, know that I'ma take one
Only mobbin' with my day one niggas
Only shoppin' for like 15 minutes in a different city
When I'm on tour
More contemporary than a war tour, not a label whore
I don't play with niggas
Talkin' color palettes, seein' silhouettes
You see me takin' pictures
I'ma build on that
And it don't matter, I'ma chill on that
You can see it when you see me
I'ma always be me
I can keep it real like that

[Mick Jenkins & TheMIND:]
Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you

[Mick Jenkins:]
OK, the love of money root of all evil
OK, the camel through a eye of a needle 'fore a rich man
Before a rich man know heaven
So I'm in this bitch, no wrist band
Movin', dippin', dodgin' through the temptation
I've been hasty, I be patient
I've been maybed to be never heard from again
So when I got the cash
I be spendin' like we savin'
Say, "he trippin'" till you check my balance
10 years later you can check my talents
I done doubled up from a 2-4 from 5-10
I never been no type of man to hide his shit beneath the dirt
Crack a smile beneath the hurt
You can only do that when you knew that
All those things that you had when you was up was just stuff
Without it it's like, Kith, its Just Us
Who are you when no one's lookin'?
Most niggas crooked, they money exposed
It's always sunny until it's cloudy
And then you suppose
That that door to the boat, will still be open when you reach it
Hope it work out like before you
I wouldn't bet on that myself though

[Woman:] Oh you never heard somebody say it's a different type of love?
[Mick:] It is, and I'm j-, I just admitted that like, it definitely is. It def- def- i-i-is Like, I'm not denying that, like, I have to say that is, it is a different type of love...
(I told you that, 6 months ago!)

// Fall Through //

Hesitate
Hesitate
Hesitate

Don't you feel the soul?
That's just you as well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate

Had to fall on his knees for a second
Stop, dropped and rolled in the middle of this fire
And the smoke (smoke) had to go and breathe for a second
Plus I needed direction, a fork in every road at like three intersections
Pray for the sermon, I'm seeking his blessing
This ain't no sermon but vermin ain't never want to see they reflection
Come and see his reflection
Like... mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the most hated of them all?
Most creative of them all
Who's post-racial, who's the most basic?
Who despite that love them all?
So sticks and stones I rub them off
At this hater conjunction I'm an apostrophe, above them all
That's why I keep my circle small
Seen so many rush as Limbaugh
Niggas talking shit that I just cannot trust at all
But trust I fall, you can trust I'll tell you just how I trip
Before I ever power trip, brought the light like a power strip
Fuck a Powerade, we bringing water
On some sraight 'Black Power' shit
Shift the culture watch the power shift
Fist raised, nigga proud as shit
Even if you wasn't privy to the trees know you hear the leaves loud as shit
When autumn asked you
Do you (do you do you do you do you)...

When autumn falls, you see the leaves (light, light)
You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze (I see the light)
Hesitate
Hesitate
Hesitate
When autumn falls, you see the leaves
You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze
Descendants of the realest souls
Children of the Indigo
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (When autumn falls, you see the leaves)
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze)

Don't you feel the soul?
That's just you as well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate

We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
I been all around the globe, different languages they feel me they don't hear me though
Told us we was inferior, we imperial
I've been talking all this Lake Superior
If you curios, I been spreading love in a more serial sense
Politicking with my big homie Sensai
City really been on fire since 10Day
Shave the truffles on my penne I'm eating good
Nigga crooked but my pen straight I've been straight
Concentrating on these compositions
Fuck the opposition gotta do with my position?
Is it popping or is y'all just politicking

'Cause I might fall through if I catch the breeze
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
'Cause I might fall through if I catch the breeze
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
Fall, fall through
Fall through if I, breeze breeze
Fall through, if-
Know you probably missed the roots
Fall through, breeze, breeze
Breeze, breeze, know you probably missed the-
Fall through, fall through
Fall through, fall through, fall through
Fall-, fall through

// Love, Robert Horry //

Love is free
Love is free
Uh

Photos of my life through these allegory
Shots from the corner like I'm Robert Horry
Or Anne Leibovitz you need a bigger name
Or that nigga from City of God, I forget his name
Be too worried how the picture fit the frame sometimes
Celebrating 'fore you even win the game, what's the basis?
Euro stepping, switching lanes, it's so easy to forget about the basics
How we pace it on the daily
But it sure is grapes that sun dried, it's raisins in the sun, my eyes is watching God
No need for hesitation
Always moving with conviction even if they gon' convict me
Yeah they hit me with a sentence all that did was teach me patience
All I did was finish Trees & Truths and start The Water[s]
And I wrote every single word like a court reporter's attention to detail
I can see the bullshit in all of the retails
Still I copped the Yeezys though, I bought them hoes resale
Grabbed all the clothes that I could like Ezal
Yeah we fly, throw a piece sign, I mean well
The cream rise, I need the weed high
Oh, we fell from the sky onto these waves
They see shore with sea shells
Most don't see straight at all
But the money on the way like a mail in rebate
The mall ain't never been the place
To ball, it's Free Nation
Aw, it's Free Nation

[J-Stock:]
I found peace in the heart of the storm
I had to get released 'till inner demons was gone
Always kept to myself, never fit in with the norm
All I had was the pain, he tried give me the calm
All I had was the darkness 'till he gave me  a don
I was 12 with no parents then he gave me my mom
22 no direction then he gave me the jawn
Then I linked with the Nation and they helped me move on
Now I'm staring directly at the sun 'till my eyes go blind
Nigga never understand, the purpose is so divine
I'm way too far out, you can never change my mind
It's a half an eight later the thoughts are just too inclined
Pictures too intense, make you have to press rewind
Cause everything's microwaved, they don't ever take the time
Free give you what you need, for spirit, body, and mind
If keeping it real is wrong then I be committing crimes
Every line hit like a projec-tile from the nine
Take a piece out your melon, put a tingle down your spine
It's how you know it's the truth
The feeling can't be defined
My nigga it's FreeNation, we water turned into wine

Give you photos of my life through these allegory
Lotta niggas talk but they ain't got a story
We out here taking shots from the corner like a young Robert Horry
I don't need to hear the comments for me
I'm in another lane
5AM, I'm on another plane
If you get the picture you can peep it through whatever frame

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Love is free
Love is free
Love is free
(Love? Love is loving someone)
(I don't know what love is)

// Angles //

[Havier OmÃ¤r:]
I've been running away, cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna pray
Hope the bridges we burnin-in', yeah
Light the way for another day
I only do it if (I want to)
Look in the mirror, do I (want you)?
I don't know. Do you know?
Come on mister, (don't lie)
What do you feel when you look into your (own eyes)?

[Mick Jenkins:]
See it's all about angles
Whether I'm checking my watch or I'm hitting my dab
You use the same muscles to cough with as you would do to laugh
It's perspective really, the collective is merely suggesting a theory that love is a blessing
I'm stressing it really
Man y'all don't hear me, if you've never been alone how you know yourself?
If you ain't up on the water how you grow yourself?
You should love you so much that you go Marylin Manson and blow yourself
It's some things that you gotta learn that only you can show yourself
Getting introspective, it can only go right like you ain't got no left
Like a wack-ass point guard
Or a porn star, yeah I'm going hard
Young Coinstar
I've done seen change, trying to turn this shit to dollar bills
Touching souls, not just copping feels
See myself when I see my friends
They make sure that I ain't lost the real
Lost at sea or lost at thought
I give a fuck, I ever lost a deal
I'm hungry to see me, be me like a nigga lost a mill'

[Xavier OmÃ¤r:]
I've been running away, cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna pray
Hope the bridges we burnin-in', yeah
Light the way for another day
I only do it if I want to
Look in the mirror, do I want you?
I don't know. Do you know?
Come on mister, don't lie
What do you feel when you look into your own eyes?

[Noname:]
(I am, um) I am absolutely, positively happy
Exponential, gratitude for rapping
Aptitude for passing dude's exceptions
The vacancy will always be the laughing
Cause niggas love a bitch when she's sarcastic
Rihanna is made of feather dust and matches
And everybody wants to touch the fire
A little bit of love never hurt nobody
Y'all in the club while I'm sitting in the attic
Thinking bout the plastic, a trip to Malibu
Spend a couple racks on racks say hallelu-
In the waiting room trying to get to you
And who could be the breadwinner? Me
And who could cook your next dinner? Me
I think not, I'm saving up for Audi
This is, allegory of a wack-long cloudy
I am absolutely, positively healthy
Re-define to expedite my wealthy
I need money, halfway sunny, out the country
Only God and a blunt could help me
And Noname quit the weed
Happy with sunlight in my weave
Synonymous with all anonymous and verbal columnists
A good rap song is all I need

[Xavier OmÃ¤r:]
I've been running away, cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna pray

I don't know. Do you know?
Come on mister, (don't lie)
What do you feel when you look into your (own eyes)?

[Mick Jenkins:]
Had to get to know myself before I claimed I loved me
Nobody else, just for myself, got more myself just for me
Growing everyday, I'm growing everyday, growing everyday
Wake up early in the morning for you now
Had to get to know myself before I claimed I loved me
Nobody else, just for myself, got more myself just for me
Growing everyday, I'm growing everyday, growing everyday
Wake up early in the morning for you now

// Fucked Up Outro //

[Michael Anthony:]
Who could wish
Who could wish, wish wish and go away, oh
Dreaming is living
It's your world now
I am not flawless
I am not perfect
I sin in my soul
I cut through the surface
Repair, heal, and spread love
From deep within, work the path and the vision
Then you can see the fruits of living
And use your roots [?]

You'd never expect it from him right?
Please don't confuse shade with the shadows from dim lights
I been bright
I been in spaces dark as midnight
My pen write on both
My insight on both is skin tight
In spite of the fact that I'm inside the hoax
All my niggas got a horcrux or two or four
We don't die, we multiply but you knew that already
Shift the culture, we do that already
If you don't give me credit for nothing but making kids in Chicago drink more water
I proved that already
I'm someone with influence who'll use that to better the youth
And that don't make me better than you
But as far as this rap shit goes
If Drake ain't holding down Quentin Miller why the fuck would I ever give any credit to you
We learning the business
We keep us some sage
We shit on these niggas then burn up some incense
Drop off the album and turn up the interest
Make 'em pay interest
Since they was so disinterested before
Like it wasn't this intricate
Or we didn't use instruments before
Check that insolence at the door
Or, it can get a lot more intimate than you expected
The underrated and often neglected
Are often expected to deal with it

I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)

And as I was saying
The underrated and often neglected
Are often expected to deal with it
Like we in here off a meal ticket or something
The lack of respect is astounding
And I refuse to accept it
Niggas talking crazy
(I think y'all niggas got me fucked up)
And you not finna tell me that I'm crazy
Cause I choose to correct it
Rather than play unaffected
Check my demeanor
Still waters run deep as the love and the serve from Serena
Balls in my court and we serving subpoenas
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this view
Straight truth, no tricks, no presto
It's drink more water, don't trip off petrol
Just sip the kool-aid
The same wrist that makes this whip the Pesto
Break bread with me
Better yet, bake bread with me
We be so worried bout how much we need the dough
We tend to forget the little things we need to know
Like how to knead the dough
If done properly it won't spread so thin when your people show
It happened to me, I peeped it though
Before I hit my peak, young Pistol Pete
I could thread the needle through three peep holes
I'm four iPhones and two pencils deep at this point
The cliffs don't seem so steep at this point
And all I see is wolves and sheep at this point
No Lil' Bo Peep

I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)

[Michael Anthony:]
Who could wish
Who could wish, wish and go away, oh
Dreaming is living
It's your world now

Waters was just the introduction to the idea that there's this truth...niggas been missin', right? But I feel like people, don't know what that truth was. I wasn't very specific about what that was. So...in looking for how to be specific about what that is because there's so much that needs to be told to people, you understand what I'm saying. Uh, love came to me as a, as, what should be a focus because that's the focus of Jesus' message on Earth. You know what I'm saying and if that's what leads my life, which is my faith then it only makes sense to start there
