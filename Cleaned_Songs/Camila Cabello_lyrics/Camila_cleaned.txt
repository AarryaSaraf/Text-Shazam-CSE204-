// Never Be The Same //

Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemical all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain

Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
You say, "Stop playing it safe, girl,
I wanna see you lose control."

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

I'm saying it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (you're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

// All These Years //

Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Your smile's just a little softer

And I, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second, it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Oh yeah)

Couldn't help, but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

And I, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second, it all came back, it all came back

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (you are near)
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go (ooh)
And you probably will never know (oh)
You're still the one I'm after all these years

I never told you, I should've told you
I never told you after all these years

I never told you (I never told you)
I never told you
I never told you after all these years

// She Loves Control //

Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesn't cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up (give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up)

Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (oh)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up, give it up for love)

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
Oh, you know that she loves it; she can't live without it, no
She loves control (control, hey)
Control, hey!

// Havana //

[Camila Cabello:]
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Ooh... I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh... and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
Fresh out East Atlanta
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam)
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)
Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me
Get to eatin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that B
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, pretty baby

// Inside Out //

(Don't you waste them other girl's time)
'Cause once you've had my love
They will never be enough, never be enough

Wanna love you inside out

Cause I wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out

Cause I wanna love you inside out

Grew up on southside of Miami
That's where I was when you found me
Thought that you could go on without me
Now you can't see you without me
Sky high, sky high
Oh my my, oh my my
'Cause once you've had my love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
There will never be enough, never be enough

Baby, give it to me, no doubt
'Cause I wanna love you inside out
I wanna love you inside out
Show me what your inside 'bout
I don't wanna know no word of mouth
'Cause I wanna love you inside out (yeah)

// Consequences //

Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh
Said no, ooh-ooh-ooh
I, no, ooh-ooh-ooh, mhm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Yeah, loving you

// Real Friends //

No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

I stay up, talkin' to the moon
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

(Lookin' for some real friends)

I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

// Something's Gotta Give //

Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh
Something's gotta give

// In The Dark //

Blank stares, faithless
Vampires at the same places
Shadows, traces
I know that you feel me

You're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me? Why can't you show me?
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3 AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

Plus one, guest list
But you don't even know what her name is
Secrets, endless
I know that you feel me

You're runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin

I, I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me? Why can't you show me?
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3 AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

Darling, come on and let me in
Darling, all of the strangers are gone, they're gone
I said, darling, come on and let me see
Darling, I promise that I won't run

So tell me
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3 AM
And you're all alone (and you're all alone)
And L.A. doesn't feel like home?
No, I, I, I
Who are you in the dark?

Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?

// Into It //

Ooh, I'm not a psychic
But I see myself all over you (ooh)
Ooh, I'm sick on you, sick on you
But you're the medicine, too (ooh)

The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing and words just get in the way
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

Ooh, I'm holding my, holding my breath
Until I'm turning blue (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, don't save me, don't save me, don't save me
I'll fall into you, fall into you

This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it
I'm into it, I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking
I could get into it (I'm into it)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner
We should get into it (I'm into it)
Enough of the conversation, baby, let's get into it (I'm into it)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing, oh
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question
You know what I'm gonna say (say baby)

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it (thinking, I...)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it (into it, yeah)
All of the things I wanna do to you is infinite (everything is infinite)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it (if you're into it)
I'm into it, I'm into it

I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
If you're into it, I'm into it

// Never Be The Same (Radio Edit) //

Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go of the ways I used to fall in lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touchin' me
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
He said, "stop playing it safe, girl, I wanna see you lose control"

Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touchin' me
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, ooh, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe

// I Have Questions //

Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds and I am tryin' to numb them all

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are?
You've got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never, ever, ever trusted you
(I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you, who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I've got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are?
You've got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never, ever, ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here

I have questions for you, ooh
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have questions for you, ooh
I have questions for you (foul play, no, foul play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you

How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions
