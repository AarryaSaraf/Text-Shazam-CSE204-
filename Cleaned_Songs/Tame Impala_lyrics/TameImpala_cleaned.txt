// Skeleton Tiger //

Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

Count the number of beings you are, see how long it takes you

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

// Half Full Glass Of Wine //

Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
You don't know how hard it can be

// Forty One Mosquitoes Flying In Formation //

Lazy bones and no concern sees, forty one mosquitoes flying in formation
I'm alright but my pet cockroach died of starvation
Sleep till late, I won't mind if we do nothing today
Come and stay, bring your friends, who needs floor space anyway?
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?

Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh

The other side of the land, they like my brain, they don't waste time and they don't wait
They can do what they want, as long as I don't have to concentrate
Broken drums, thriving dreams, not much else between these walls
One more spliff, I am already gone but duty calls
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?

Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh

// Slide Through My Fingers //

When I get up I've dreamt too long
Everything else is half as strong
I could see though, outside my head
They got it right, I got it wrong

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her

Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've planned
Who is the one who can't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't I know

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her

I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers

// Wander //

Save your fragile mama's heart,
And though she will come for you,
But I wander

And I wonder,
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking talk so easily,
For hours on end I wander,
Still I don't even...know her

Feel just like I need to be,
Back where I was,
Before I couldn't do that,
And I wander

And I wonder,
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking talk so easily,
For hours on end I wander,
Still I don't even know

How it keep a lid on me,
How it keep a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me

And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking tough so easily,
For hours on end I wander

How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me (and I wonder),
How it keeps a lid on me (just how far will you need to be),
How it keeps a lid on me (for shaking tough so easily),
How it keeps a lid on me (for hours on end I wonder),
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me
