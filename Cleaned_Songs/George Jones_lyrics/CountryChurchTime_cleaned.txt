// Boat Of Life //

My friend, is the going rough with troubled seas around
To angry when you set your soul and dark clouds on you frown
Have you ever looked for bread and only found a stone
But it's because you're paddling your boat of life alone.

Is the raft you once had charted now both blurred and marred
Is you soul and body weary, the task of rowin' hard
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known
But it's because you're paddling your boat of life alone.

My friend there is one who knows your every fault and sin
And he knows your trouble and your whole dear life of sin
So why not call on Jesus, He'll help you safely on
Oh, my friend, it's foolish to paddle all alone

// Taggin' Along //

Well, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, if I see that's heaven's story
Ain't nothin' ever a-go wrong
Ah, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not might tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, I may not be able to preach
And I may not be able to sing
I may not be able to do very much
For my Lord and King
But if this one thing I'm persuaded
Oh, do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
If I keep a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' gonna ever go wrong
Cause, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Although the path grows rugged
And although the path grows steep
I keep a-trusting in my savior
Who is so mighty that he
And when the saints go marchin' in there
I'll sing a victory song
Yes, by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
If I keep on a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' ever gonna ever go wrong
And, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along

Well, when I reach my home in Heaven
The sweet land above
I'm gonna sing redemptions story
I'm gonna praise Him for His love
And when the saints go marchin' in there
Do you dare tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, if I keep a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' gonna ever go wrong
Cause, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along...

// My Lord Has Called Me //

My Lord, has called me today 
To go the straight and narrow way
So for my Lord I'll surely live
Yes, my Lord has called today.
God warned us all
To live in sin no more
To place our faith in him
To reach the other shore.
My Lord, has called me today 
To go the straight and narrow way
So for my Lord I'll surely live
Yes, my Lord has called today.
God warned us all
To live in sin no more
To place our faith in him
To reach the other shore.
My Lord, has called me today 
To go the straight and narrow way
So for my Lord I'll surely live
Yes, my Lord has called today.

// Take The Devil Out Of Me //

Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

I've traveled far down this lonesome road
The devil he's got me bent down so low
I've just found out where I want to be
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

I'm getting tired of living in sin
I'm tired of keeping the devil for my friend
I want so badly to be set free
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

Now, I'm so happy, I'm free from sin
Because I left my dear Savior in
My Jesus told me that I was free
Oh Jesus, thank you
You took the devil outta me.

I'm getting tired of living in sin
I'm tired of keeping the devil for my friend
I want so badly to be set free
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

// Cup Of Loneliness //

I say Christian pilgrim so redeemed from sin,
Hauled out of darkness a new life to begin.
Were you ever in the valley where the way is dark and dim?
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

Did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake?
The stand that you so boldly for the Lord did take.
Did they ever mock at you and laugh in ways quit grim?
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

Did you ever try to preach then old fashioned pray?
And even when you did it that did not seem a way.
And you lost all courage then lost all you vim.
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

All my friends 'tis bitter sweet while here on earth we stopped.
To follow in the footsteps that our dear Savior crossed
To suffer with the savior and when the way is dark and dim
The drink of the bitter cup of loneliness with him...

// If You Want To Wear A Crown //

You've got to run to win the race
Go along the way and quick the pace
So remember when you're worried faith is fallin' down
That you got to bear a cross if you want to wear a crown
Our Lord is testing us each day
He'll try us out in every way
So don't despair when burdens fall around
You got to bear a cross if you want to wear a crown

We've seen some men rise to the top
Then fall apart if they should drop
They can't live on without their wealth
They blame the Lord above and they never blame themselves
Out of these fallen some will rise
Accept their fate and realize
That their own trial to God they'll hear the trumpet sound
That you got to bear the cross if you want to wear a crown...

// My Soul's Been Satisfied //

I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Well the Lord moves in mysterious ways
His wonders to perform
You know He plants His feet on ev'ry step
And then He rides on ev'ry storm
Well He fixed my feet for runnin', friends
Then my eyes were opened up wide
He fixed my tongue so I could say
"Praise God, I'm satisfied."

I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Well it was way down yonder in the valley, friends
I was wanderin' all alone
And it was there I met my Jesus, well
You know He claimed me for His own
And then He put His arms all around me there
And then He drew me up to His side
He placed my feet on solid ground
And now I'm satisfied

I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Oh yes I'm satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus, 
Satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
