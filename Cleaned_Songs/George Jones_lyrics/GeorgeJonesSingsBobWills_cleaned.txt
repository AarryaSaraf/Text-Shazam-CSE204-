// Bubbles In My Beer //

Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past, rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings alone silent tear to my eye
Oh! I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with hearthaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past, that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And the chances I know have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer...

// Faded Love //

As I look at the letters
That you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines
That to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love.

I miss you darlin' more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love.

I think of the past
And all the pleasures we've had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime
That you said goodbye
And I remember our faded love.

I miss you darlin' more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love...

// Roly Poly //

Roly Poly, eatin' corn n' 'taters,
Hungry ev'ry minute of the day;
Roly Poly, gnawin' on a biscuit,
Long as he can chew it, it's okay.

He can eat an apple pie,
An' never even bat an eye,
He likes everything from soup to hay;
Roly Poly, daddy's little fattie
Bet he's gonna be a man someday.

Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast,
Bread n' jelly twenty times a day;
Roly Poly, eats a hardy dinner,
It takes lots of strength to run and play.

Pulls up weeds and does the chores,
And he runs both ways to all the stores,
He works up an appetite that way;
Roly Poly, daddy's little fattie,
Bet he's gonna be a man someday...

// Trouble In Mind //

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
Because the sun's gonna shine 
In my back door someday.

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19
Pass through my worried mind.

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
And I've almost lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like livin'
Sometimes I feel like dyin'.

I'm going down to the river
I'm going to buy me a rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'm goin' to rock away from here.

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
My ole heart is a-beating slow
I never had so much trouble
In my life before.

My good gal she's gone to Sydney
And it sure did grieve my mind
When you see me laughing
I'm just a-trying to keep from cryin'.

Trouble In Mind...

// Take Me Back To Tulsa //

Where's that gal with the red dress on,
Some folks call her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry.

Little bee sucks the blossom
The big bee gives the honey
Dark man picks the cotton
The white man gets the money.

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry.

Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie.

We'll I've always got a great big smile
Never do look sour,
Travelin' all over this country
Playin' by the hour.

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry...

// The Warm Red Wine //

Put a nickel in the jukebox
And let it play
For my heart is troubled with pain
Take the cork from the bottle
Of the warm red wine
And fill my glass up, again.

Fill my glass to the brim
Till it flows o'er the rim
Like the tears flow in this heart of mine
Then I'll say so long
To the dreams that are gone
On account of the warm red wine.

Oh, a prison of stone
With it's cold iron bars
Is no more than a prison than mine
I'm a prisoner of drink
Who will never escape
From the chains of the warm red wine.

Oh, the wine is red
So warm and red
Like the ribbon 
It sparkles and shines
But I paid for the wine
Yeah, That one red wine
With all of my hopes
And in my dreams...

// Time Changes Everything //

There was a time when I thought of no other,
And we sang our own love's refrain;
Our hearts beat as one as we had our fun, 
But time changes everything.

When you left me my poor heart was broken 
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark cloud have gone and there's blue skies again 
'Cause, time changes everything.

Well, time has passed, I've forgot you 
Mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you 
'Cause, time changes everything.

Oh, you can change the name of an old song 
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you 
But time changes everything.

So good luck to you, may god bless you
I can't say that we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine
'Cause, time changes everything...

// Worried Mind //

You promised me love
That would never die
That promise you've made
Was only a lie.

Now after you've gone
All alone I've pined
For all that I've got
Was a worried mind.

I gave you a ring
I gave you a home
You promised me love
That you'd never wrong.

I bought you fine clothes
And I bought you wine
But all that I got
Was a worried mind.

And when I was down
You've just left me there
I needed you so
But you didn't care.

You found a new love
And a home so fine
But all that I've got
Is a worried mind...

// San Antonio Rose //

Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue, up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone...

// Steel Guitar Rag //

Been runnin' around, seen many a town, 
And maybe you'll find I'm the kind of guy that brags.
But listen to me and see if you don't agree
No melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag.

And when they slide that thing, along those strings
It soubds so dogone heavenly, you can hear the Angels sing
And when you stomp your feet, your heart will beat,
A rhythm to the old steel guitsr rag.

You may be kind choosy, 'bout the kind of songs you hear,
You maybe like them blusey, makes you cry right in your beer,
But if you want a song that's bound to dry away your tears,
Make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag...
