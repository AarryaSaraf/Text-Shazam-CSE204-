// All American Girls //

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

The day has finally come
We're reaching out for number one
We've worked hard all of our lives
It's a fight just to survive

You'd better get this straight
Wise up before it's too late
We're not threatened by your lies
Or your goodbyes

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

Sometimes the struggle gets rough
You give your all, but it's not enough
A vacant job at the top
Don't let them tell you that right you're not

We're not asking to reverse
Roles so long rehearsed
Give us an equal share
That's just fair

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

All American
All American girls
All American
All American

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, and know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
'Cause we're all American girls
Hear what we say, and know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say

// He's Just A Runaway (A Tribute To Bob Marley) //

He's just a runaway
Runaway

He'll run and break your heart
He's just a runaway
Runaway

He'll run and break your heart

She was stanging there all alone
Had no money left
Love hangs on the phone
No one's home
It was Saturday
Getting hot
Conscious walked away
Can his heart be caught? Love is not bought
Still she wants

He's just a runaway
Runaway

Yes
He has honest eyes and a lovely face
It happens ev'ry time. Innocence lies
But the weekend pass on reality
Served to bring him back

Love was just an act for so long - now he's gone
He's just a runaway
Runaway

He's just a runaway
Runaway

Yes
He has honest eyes and a lovely face

He's just a runaway
Runaway

He's just a runaway
Runaway

// If You Really Want Me //

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

So you've got me
Deep in your heart, babe
Look into my eyes
They say that you need me
You've got to peel
What you say is for real
Inside your love
Promise me to please me
Baby don't tease me

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

Say you want me
To stay by your side babe
Open up your heart
Say that you'll keep me
You've got to hold me
Inside of your love
And say you will
Never leave me
Say that you need it

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

// Next Time You'll Know //

Looks like we're running out of time
Can't hide away
In nights
No longer yours or mine

All things must change
It's so painful
When nothing ever stays the same
But I must go on
While you run away from love, oh

[Chorus:]
Next time you'll know
Not to let my love go
When you feel afraid
And you can't love nobody
Next time you'll know
You must let your heart show
Till the dying day
My friend

Maybe I hurt too easily
But is it wrong to
Feel betrayed when love can't be?

You could change your mind
No excuses could ever
Make me change mine
But I've got to be strong
And believe I'll find the love
Oh

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh
Believe it

[Repeat Chorus x2]

// Ooh, You Caught My Heart //

Ooh, you caught my heart tonight
Don't throw it away baby
Ooh, you caught my heart tonight
Don't throw it away baby

Weekends gone to bed
Monday blues about to begin
It's been a long haol
My body's tired
Wake me when the loneliness ends
Telephone screams
Baby pick me up
There you are with promises of love
Temptation begs
And ooh I surrender
And now you know
I can't get enough

Takes so long
To find trust
Hiding in the shadows
Of earth
You say it's alright
To believe
Cause you care about my love
Too much
On my own
There's no complications
But two can tear it to the ground
Love's a fool
It turns of desperation
Don't take advantage of me
When I'm down

// Music Makes Me Feel Good //

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

My body is feeling free
It lets the music
Flow through me

If you feel like dancing
Feeling fine
Let your body rock
Shake it
Let the music keep time

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

Ooh in the music
Makes you feel good
You should get up and move
Let the music
Makes you feel good
You, you've got to groove

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

The rhythm is in my feet
I can't stand it
When the music
Starts to beat, no
When I feel it creeping
Up my soul
I begin to groove
Move it
Let the music take control

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

// I Don't Want To Say Goodbye //

It's tearing me apart
To watch you go
Believing with my heart
And my soul
That all I ever wanted
Was loving you
I never knew you'd
Leave this way

Ooh I don't want
To say good bye

You'd think by now
I'd be fooled
I don't want to say good bye
So turn around
And walk away
Never look behind
Cause I don't want to
Say good bye

You're the only one
Deep inside
Why you want to run
And hide
Cause all I ever wanted
Was loving you
And all you've got to do is stay

Ooh I don't want
To say good bye
