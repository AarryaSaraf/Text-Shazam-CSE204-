// Circle Of Love (Caught In The Middle) //

Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
I'm in a circle of love

Sooner or later, I know a time will come
When I can't hold out any longer
How am I ever gonna settle down?
Well now, Johnny's a sweet thing
Billy's just having fun
Makes me hardly think what they telling me
All this attention's got me spinning round

Yeah, hey, I'm caught in the middle
I'm in a circle of love (circle of love)
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle, ooh
I'm in a circle of love (circle of love)
Come on, baby, I'm caught in the middle
I'm in a circle of love (circle of love)
Yeah-eah, I'm caught in the middle
Well, I'm in a circle of love, yeah

They keep me busy and I love him as he wonder
What complications are growing
I got to hurry and make up my mind
(make up my mind)
Well, hey (make up my mind)
But he's so dizzy and I'm having so much fun
That I hope this will never ending

So I will ask for more of his precious time

Yeah, yeah, I'm caught in the middle, ooh
I'm in a circle of love (circle of love)
Yeah, yeah, I'm caught in the middle, well
I'm in a circle of love, baby (circle of love)
I'm caught in the middle, yeah-eah
I'm in a circle of love, yeah (circle of love)
Ooh, I'm caught in the middle
Well, well, well now
Yeah-eah, yeah, yeah (circle of love)

In the middle, going down
I got to get my feet on the ground
Yeah, whoo
Get rid of John for Pete's sake
Ooh, yeah-eah

I'm caught in the middle, yeah-eah
I'm in a circle of love, baby (circle of love)
Ooh, I'm caught in the middle, yeah-eah
I'm in a circle of love, baby (circle of love)
Whoa oh, caught right in the middle
I'm in a circle of love (circle of love)
Ooh ooh, I'm caught in the middle, ooh ooh

Ooh, I'm changing Johnny too
I can love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby

// Cross My Heart //

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

Can't believe (can't believe)
That you could be so cruel and mean (cruel and mean)
Leave me hangin' like a leaf on a tree
Blowing it away (blowing it away)
Don't say love is over
Before it begins

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

You thought love (you thought love)
Was free and easy
Now you find (now you find)
That it's not so easy
Don't throw up your hands
And walk away (and walk away)
Let's work together
And make our love's first rate

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

Don't throw up your hands
And walk away (and walk away)
Let's work together, baby
And make our love's first rate, ohhhh

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die, no, no
Cross my heart, baby
I love you, boy
(Hope to die)

Ohhh, ohhh, ohh yeah
Baby, baby, baby, ohh yeahhhh
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh, no, baby
Oh, oh, I love you, boy
Love you, boy
Ohh, ohh, no, don't ever leave me
Ohh, yeahh, ohhh, ohhh, ooooh

// Protect Our Love //

Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back just trying a little tougher
To protect our love
Gonna let nobody take it
Ain't gonna share no love
'Cause it took too long to make it, yeah, huh

Oh, every hurt sinks a little bit deeper
I come back just trying to be sweeter
To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love

Long as if our world keeps turning

Neither one of us would care to endanger (Endanger)
Love behind a stranger (A stranger)
We knew the stakes would be high
Still we give love a try
Now I refuse to stand by
And just let it die, yeah, yeah

Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back, hey, just trying a little tougher
To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love
Long as if our world keeps turning
Mm, come on and sing it to me

No, no, no

Your love is right
Keeps everything hard to find, now
No, no, no
I love you
You know it's true, ah, ha
No, no, no
You love me
That's the way it's got to, got to be
No (Ooh, yeah), no, no
Uh huh, baby, yeah, yeah

We knew the stakes would be high
Still we give love a try
Now I refuse to stand by
And just let it die, yeah, yeah

Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back just trying a little tougher

To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love
Long as if our world keeps turning

Come on, everybody, come on
Sing, sing a little soft to me

No (Yeah, ooh, uh), no (ha), no
We've got to, got to, got to stay together now

I can't deny this feeling inside
That makes me love you
I'm under a spell but how can I tell

// Don't You Miss Him Now //

So it's finally over, huh?
Yeah, look at you
I guess you really miss your baby now that he's gone
And I think you realize you'll never miss your water
Until the well runs dry

Now you're free
To do as you please
Love's in the past
You're a free girl at last
You can do all the things (Do all the things)
He never let you do (He never let you do)

Won't be around to check up on you

But when you're alone
You're gonna find you still care
Call out his name
And you wish he was there
Don't you miss him now?

Go on, live it up (Live it up)
Have yourself a ball (Have yourself a ball)
There's no one there
To cause you trouble at all
You can go out each night (Go out each night)
And hang out till dawn (Hang out till dawn)
He won't be around
To fuss and carry on

But when you're alone

You're gonna find you still care
Call out his name
And you wish he was there
Don't you miss him now? Yeah, yeah

Now you're all alone (I know you miss him)
Mm, mm
You got no one to call your own (I know you miss him), yeah
I know you feel like crying (I know you miss him)
'Cause there's no denying
He's gone (He's gone), yeah, yeah

When you're alone

Call out his name, yeah, yeah, yeah
And you wish he was there
He's you're baby

// You're Much Better Off Loving Me //

She gives you nothing
But you'll give your all
The harder you try
The deeper you fall
Won't be long before you find
Her love is just a waste of time
Soon you agree
You're much better loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
She's never home
Leaves you there all alone (all alone)
You hurt deep inside
'Cause life's passing you by
Won't be long before you see
Her love is only make-believe
Soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
I'll gave you a new love
One you can depend on
Then you will see
How beautiful love can be
(Love can be, love can be) yeah
Mmm
Mm
Oh, won't be long before you find
Her love is just a waste of time
Soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
Yeah, soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
Mmm (much better off)
Ooh, I see you, oh oh (much better off)
You're much better off loving me, boy
Oooh ooh ooh
You gonna find she won't care (much better off)
