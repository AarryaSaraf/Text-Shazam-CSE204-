// Go Down Easy //

You know
Very soon, very soon, very soon
It can pour down
And then very soon, very soon
When the rain comes
No more, no more
No more pain, no more pain
For you and me

When the rain come
When the rain come
When the rain come
Oh go down easy

Curl around it
Like a bird in the spring
Come out and just
Any time and I'll sing the things you bring

Go down easy
Go down easy

And as we lie in dry dust
Just like the evil rust
Easy
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the hard case and yourself kissing the soil
Once please

Do you like the rain coming
Do you like the rain falling down
Sometimes I love the rain falling down
Curl around it, like some bird in the spring
Talk to me, I'll sing the things you bring

Go down easy
Right now, look at the rain
A gentle message from above
