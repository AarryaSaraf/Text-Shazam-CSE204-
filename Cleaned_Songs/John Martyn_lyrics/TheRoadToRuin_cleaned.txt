// Primrose Hill //

Went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill
The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill
Never could be anything else
Never should be anything else
Cos I like that kind of life
I like that kind of life

Never thinking too far ahead
Hanging high, I fall to bed
That's the only kind of life I've led
Just the pictures in your room
Smell the rose's sweet perfume
While you're around, you've got to hear this tune
And all those groovy guys
And all those groovy guys

We went to see the sun go down on Primrose Hill
The Sunday evening sun go down on Primrose Hill
Never could be anything else
Never should be anything else
Cos I like that kind of life
I like that kind of life
Do you like that kind of life?
Do you like that kind of life?
Do you like that kind of life?

// Parcels //

I'll take your sadness, make it mine
And leave the madness in your mind
Well you know, we have gifts to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine

The space between us growing small
Some time you know, we'll use it all
Now you see we have things to receive
Turn around, I'll show you mine

And all the things you give me now
I'll try to pay you back somehow
Well you know, we have things to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine

I took your sadness, made it mine
And you felt my madness in your mind
Well you know, we have gifts to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine

// Auntie Aviator //

Auntie Aviator
Sooner than much later, we'll be there
Flying high above the clouds
Take a look and I'll be everywhere

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
And if we don't want to
We won't come down

Said I was a dreamer
That all I ever did was sit and stare
Take me out to no-man's land
If you want to, I can take you there

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
She's a good ship
She will fly

Now you're flying with me
We can take it easy for a while
Cruising far above the clouds
All I want to do is see you smile

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
I'll never let you down
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We'll never touch the ground
And if we don't want to
We won't come down

And if we don't want to
We won't come down
And if we don't want to
We won't come down
And if we don't want to
We won't come down

// New Day //

Revolution convolution
Circles around the town
Give us all some time to think
Please let us all come down

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not who you love and not who you fear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Just behind the yawning morning
Look and there's a new day dawning
Just behind your shying crying
Look and there's a new year lying

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not who you love and not who you fear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Save your days and save your time
You save yours and I'll save mine
Drink your water, drink your wine
You drink yours and I'll drink mine

Not what you say and not what you fear
Not who you love and not who you hear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Revolution convolution
Circles around the town
Give us all some time to think
Please let us all come down

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not what you love and not what you fear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

Not what you say and not what you hear
Not who you love and not who you hear
What you feel is real
What you feel is real

// Give Us A Ring //

Well now, what's the food like, have you slept well?
And do the bugs bite other people?
And did the banker give you money?
And I saw on the postcard that you wrote it
On a beach or on your pillow
Or on a book or something stiff

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Jeffrey, he bought a cactus for the kitchen
And the rabbit's been complaining
And we sat out on the lawn
Well now, I have to go to catch the postman
Cos I'm going to the pictures
Lots of love, I bet you're brown

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Give us a ring when you get back
Try to bring me something back
With the customs there
Make sure you don't get caught
With the things that you bought

Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring when you get back
Give us a ring. Don't get caught

// Sorry To Be So Long //

Sorry to be so long
Just didn't have the time
Haven't been into the town
Somebody put me down
Sorry to be so long

Can't even put pen to paper
Not even if I try
Everything's bound to come sooner or later
Do you think I'd lie?

Sorry to be so late
Somebody locked me in
Guess it's all down to fate
Sit back and let them wait
Sorry to be so late

Can't even put pen to paper
Not even if I try
Everything's bound to come sooner or later
Do you think I'd lie?
Sorry to take your time
Should have my own to lend
I've got to get you over my line
Just want to make you my friend
And I'm sorry to take your time

Can't even put pen to paper
Not even if I try – and I have tried
Everything's bound to come sooner or later
Do you think I'd lie? Sorry to be so long
Just didn't have the time
Haven't been into the town
You know, somebody put me down
And I'm sorry to be so long

Can't even put pen to paper
Not even if I try
Everything's bound to come sooner or later
Do you think I'd lie?

// Tree Green //

And I've been thinking
About the wine we're drinking
About the line we're sinking

I'm young as a fool, and green as a tree
Happy as a man can naturally be
A good year coming, coming running
A good year coming soon
A good year coming, coming running
A good year coming soon

Young as a fool, green as a tree
Happy as a man can naturally be
With you… And I've been taking
All the love you were making
Just to keep from shaking

I'm as young as a fool and green as a tree
Happy as a man can naturally be
I just don't care if it just won't come
Cos I know my time's for free
I just don't care if it just won't come
Cos I know the call's for me

I'm happy as a man can naturally be
Living in the middle of a mystery
With you. And it's no use grieving
About the things you're leaving
About the lies deceiving

Young as a fool, and green as a tree
Happy as a man can naturally be
I just don't care if it just won't come
Cos I know my time's for free
I just don't care if it just don't come
Cos I know the call's for me

It just don't matter, just don't matter at all
It just don't matter, just don't matter at all
It just don't matter, just don't matter at all
It just don't matter, just don't matter at all

// Say What You Can //

You make me shaky
The way you play the game
And every time it works the same
You say what you can, but you can't understand
It's bigger than you, and it's true

And if I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I was so scared that we might fall
Say what you can, but you can't understand
It's bigger than you, and it's true

I think of children
Something to leave behind
They keep me worried all the time
Say what you can, but you can't understand
You just have to lie, to get by

And if I should wake up crying
It's because of the way we're dying
And I'm so scared that we might fall

And if I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I'm so scared that we might fall

You make me shaky
The way you play the game
And every time it works the same

If I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I'm so scared that we might fall

That we might fall. We might fall
We might fall. We might fall

// The Road To Ruin //

The sun was red and the sky was blue
And I went rowing on the road to ruin
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it real?

The geese were making an evening sound
And I went raving down the crazy paving
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it real?

And every day is just a joy to hold
The needle is new and the patterns are old
How do you make a game like that?
How do you make it real?

The sun was red and the sky was blue
And I went rowing on the road to ruin
How do you make a day like that?
How do you make it feel?

// Here I Am //

Here I am now
There you are beside me
After years being unhappy
Never thought I could be
Put all that bad love and evil love way behind me

Hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing

Here I am now
Got my man beside me
Here I am now
Got his sweet love to guide me
With all that bad love and evil love put right behind me

Hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing

Here I am now
Got my son beside me
Here I am now
Got this pure soul to guide me
With all that bad love and evil love way behind me
He ain't gonna find me

So hear me right now
Hear me right now
Hear me right now
This is me you're seeing
