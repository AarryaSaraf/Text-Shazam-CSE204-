// Couldn't Love You More //

If you kissed the sun right out of the sky for me
If you told me all the lies I might deserve
If you lay right down and you died for me
I could not love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I could not love you more

If you gave me everything I'd never ask of you
If you showed me all the ways you have to cry
If you lay all night in the rain for me
I could not love you more
I couldn't love you more
I could not love you more
I could not love you more

If you loved me til my eyes could no more shine for you
If you walked beside me all the long way home
If you wasted all of your time on me
Couldn't love you more
Just couldn't love you more
Just couldn't love you more
I just can't love you
How could I love you
I just can't love you
How can I love you
