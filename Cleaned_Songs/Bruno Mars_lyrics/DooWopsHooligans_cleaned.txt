// The Other Side //

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun

It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like
Until you try

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just gotta decide
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for

It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
Until you try

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just gotta decide
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we living on the other side

You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just gotta decide
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

// Count On Me //

// Talking To The Moon //

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

// Grenade //

Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...

I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...

I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Oh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But, darling, I'd still catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you'd never do the same
Oh, no no no, oh

// Just The Way You Are //

Ohhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhhh

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Yeah

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
Yeah

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah

// Runaway Baby //

Ah, yes.

Well, looky here, looky here.
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab.
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding.

I love you so, hey.
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say).
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away (don't go away)."
But when I play (but when I play),
I never stay (I never stay).
To every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say,

"Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling,
'Cause everything you heard is true.
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So, you better run, run, run away, run away, baby."

Well, let me think, let me think.
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies
That I'd like to pursue.
Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand,
There's only one carrot,
And they all gotta share it!

I love you so, hey.
That's what you'll say (that's what you'll say).
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby please don't go away (don't go away)."
But when I play (but when I play),
I never stay (I never stay).
To every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say,

"Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.

Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So, you better run, run, run away, run away, baby."

Uh, check it out

See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby.
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby.
Yup.Yup
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby.
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby.

If you're scared you better run (you better run),
You better run (you better run),
You better run (you better run),
You better—, you better—, you better—

Run, run, run away, run away, baby,
Before I put my spell on you.
You better get, get, get away, get away, darling,
'Cause everything you heard is true.
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone.
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby.

// The Lazy Song //

Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything, uh

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man

Oh-oh, yes, I said it (Ooh-ooh)
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Nothing at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh
Nothing at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out, "This is great!" (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

Oh-oh, yes I said it (Ooh-ooh)
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Today, I don't feel like doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I ain't going anywhere (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

And let everything hang loose (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

// Liquor Store Blues //

Now greetings to the world
(All of you)
Right here is the one called Bruno Mars
'Longside gang to the zilla
(Ya know me, I roll)

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
(Oh, really?)
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got
Cause 68 cent
Just ain't gonna pay the rent so
I'll be out here til they call the cops

Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

[Damian Marley:]
Here comes Junior Gang
I'm flying high like Superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't know if it's just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to the bigger heads because the whole a them a saps
All the talk them a talk unemployment no job
Enough ghetto youth cannot escape the drag

Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Now greetings to the world
