Album: GoldenHour

// Slow Burn //

Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

Whatever feels good

Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn

// Lonely Weekend //

It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely feelin' without you

Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend, yeah

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend, yeah

Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo.. it's a lo.. it's a lonely weekend

// Butterflies //

I was just coasting, never really going anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was getting kind of use to staying there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt, 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
Yeah, you give me butterflies

Now you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand, 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine, was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, hmm
You give me butterflies

// Oh, What A World //

(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)

Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things

Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

These are real things
These are real things

Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)
And then there is you
(Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic, it's hard to believe)

// Mother //

Bursting with empathy, I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors

Wish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother

// Love Is A Wild Thing //

You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah

// Space Cowboy //

You look out the window
While I look at you
Sayin' I don't know
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
There ain't room for both of us in this town

So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Oh, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space
Cowboy

// Happy & Sad //

It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down
And I don't wanna come down
No, I don't wanna come down

// Velvet Elvis //

All I ever wanted was something classic
The kinda love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

I knew it as soon as I felt it
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah

You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah

// Wonder Woman //

I like where this is going, and you like it, too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to

I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

Bet all that gold gets heavy weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary, always tryin' not to get hurt

I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies

'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the truth out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'

You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I

I know I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman

// High Horse //

Oh I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up, shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you're too good for us, you'll be good riding solo

Yeah I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't never gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain't never gonna come down
You ain't never gonna come down

// Golden Hour //

All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

Baby don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright, mhm

I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
It's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

Baby don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah

You make the world look beautiful, oooh
Thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

Yeah I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour

// Rainbow //

When it rains it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of
Staying above
The rising water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat
Take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat
Take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

It'll all be alright
