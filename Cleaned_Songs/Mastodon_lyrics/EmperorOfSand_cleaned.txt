Album: EmperorOfSand

// Sultan's Curse //

Tired and lost
No one to trust
Who is there to give the push
All I have learned
Straighten the curve
Like a circle to return

The long embrace
The smell of dirt and roses
Under the sun
No sign of breath or water
I fall asleep under blankets of stars

Ice hit you cold
Heat of surprise
Bending mind can't realize
Faith is in me
End I can see
Tears are strong as ten thousand tongues

My sweet mirage
I bathe in sacred waters
I kiss the sky
Floating in sultan's daughters
Memories of loved ones are passing me by
Memories of loved ones are passing me by

Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake
Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake

They're waiting inside
They're waiting to wash your eyes out
Their hands are alive
Alive with a fervent anger
Your feet have been tied and your tongue in your hand
Death of a thousand ravens
You're down on your knees
You're blind as the Ancient Kingdom

Relive the ages of the moon
Reeling the water close to you

// Show Yourself //

Show yourself
Show yourself
I want to see everything you're made of
Tear it down
And rip it out
Shed your skin and float it down the river
Lose yourself
Lose yourself
Wild horses ride you through the valley
Come alive
Come alive
Sail into the void without your worries

You're not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
Or could this dream
Be real at all?

Stars align
Stars align
Stars can fall and get you into trouble
Be afraid
Don't be afraid
Speak the ancient wisdom of the desert

You're not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
Or could this dream
Be real at all?

Show yourself
Show yourself
I wanna see everything you're made of
Reveal yourself
Reveal yourself
The truth will send a ripple through your body
See your fate
You'll see your fate
Death will come and steal you from the living
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
I'll see you on the other side of fire

// Precious Stones //

I hope the sun shows the way
Don't crush my spirit today
Reveal your precious stones
So I can help myself

Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do

I dig through bone and skull
Imagine black emerald
I'm covered head to toe
With diamonds in the rough

Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do

These snakes have nothing to say
I want their heads right away
I sharpen every blade
And I give them all to you
Yeah I give them all to you

You're in my head
You're in my head again

// Steambreather //

Running outside the Nazca Lines
You know I see you all in white
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines
And I'll rain to give us life

Violence born within my mind
I know it always takes its time
Climbing inside the cosmic eye
And forgive the enemy

I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

Watching you crumble to the ground
Made me want to run away
Helping you find the golden crown
Made it easier to stay

I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

At the bottom of the mountain
Unaware of my surroundings
Separation from the spirit
Let the trees fall where they may

I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself

// Roots Remain //

And the sky opened up and it swallowed us whole
All that's left is time and healing underground
Underneath us the cosmic dawn of war begins
We resolve and watch as it all crumbles down

Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty

Your adventure is dark and it hides beyond the cells
All I feel alive, the hearts will prevail
The stolen eye was found and given to the lost soul
While the moon sets far and the milestones seem low

Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty

And all that I have come to lose
Gone so long it doesn't matter anyway
And all that I have come to gain
Will remain with me until the bitter end
And when you sit and picture me
Remember sitting in the sun and dancing in the rain
The end is not the end you see
It's just the recognition of a memory

The eyes
The face
The lips
The tongue
The end
The end

// Word To The Wise //

Diving in a wishing well
Falling underneath a spell
Save me from the wicked ways
Pulling me with all its weight
High above the silver line
Flying over burning ground
Ringing bells with golden chains
Resonating with the sound

High above the silver line
Flying over burning ground
Ringing bells with golden chimes
Resonating with the sound

Siren sound
I didn't hear it

Travel deep within the mine
Never want to cross the line
Found the one I'd never sell
One I thought I'd never find

Searching thru the layers of filth
Feeling where the light is from
Always licking off the bone
Carve a way to our home

Siren sounded
I didn't hear it
Voices warned
I'd not heed it

I fell into a pit of lies
I tried to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain

I fell into a pit of lies
I tried to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain
I was to blame for all the rain

// Ancient Kingdom //

When the Sultan gives orders to take your head
You must ride the wind to safety or you'll wind up dead
Through the evil and darkness you make your stand
Only skeletons of war will guide you by the hand

Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed

The battle that rages before my eyes
Is no different than the one that is inside my head

Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed

Ancient Kingdom still remains
Crumble slowly
Ride beyond mortality
Leaving beauty now

Falling rain
Sensing pain of mind
Falling rain
Sensing pain of mind
Pain of mind

Falling rain
Sensing pain of mind
Falling rain
Sensing pain of mind
Pain of mind

Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed

Ancient Kingdom still remains
Crumble slowly
Ride beyond mortality
Leaving beauty now

Sparks explode into the air
Live forever
Ageless sounds they never die
And I will remain

// Clandestiny //

Silent all your life
Running without vision
Hollowed out inside
Wronging all that's right

There's no cause to be alarmed
And no reason to escape from us
There's no illness and no pain
And no thought of any suffering

The road is long and bare
No clarity, no light
The moment came and swallowed us
Blinding all our sight

We will keep you free from harm
All you have to do is stand with us
I will mend your broken heart
And resolve the trials that you have lost

Give your life
So I can breathe
Save our lives
It's all we need

We can lead you underground
And devour your humanity
Follow me and follow sound
To the end of your eternity

Give your life
So I can breathe
Save our lives
It's all we need

// Andromeda //

It never ends
The game isn't done
I feel the crawling and haunting
Upon us until you listen

In never ends
Enough is enough
Taking your essence and use it
To strengthen their own flesh and blood

Time watching as the sand flows through glass
Light calls to me from future and from past

This kills me to know
We cannot learn

It never ends
The ink isn't dry
The Great Consolation has written a second lease on your life
The Great Consolation has granted a second lease on your life

Light watching as the sand flows through glass
Time calls to me from future and from past

This kills me to know
We cannot learn

Time watching as the sand flows through glass (Time is moving as sands flowing)
Light calls to me from future and from past (Light is blinding radiating)

It never ends, it never ends, it never ends

Chronic illusions confusing conclusions
Foster the culture, predict the deception
Chronic delusions with caustic solutions

// Scorpion Breath //

The elusive mystery
Determined by the stars
The stigma is valid, truth and fear
The fear is real

It will set us free
Into my path
I stand in deliverance
Waiting for destruction, in a wake of blood

The awakening moment arrives
Returning you at will
The midnight hour prepares for truth
The truth is real
The truth is real

It's so far beyond my reach
The crimson mask is rising black
The last setting sun
Will be seen in my dusted mind

Constantly burying our loves
In the trench of this
Mysterious despair
It leaves us empty
Clawing in
Clawing in

The elusive mystery
Determined by the stars
The stigma is valid truth and fear
The fear is real

Free us from this feeder
Lead me in deeper
To fulfill this seed I grew
Into at my birth

// Jaguar God //

I ain't no good
And I live by the woods
They say I ain't bad
I'm the best that I've had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life
To prove that I was right

The day it went down
I was out on my pad
Not feeling so bad
I'm a suspect now
I'm a vagabond tramp
Living out on a limb

I live by the woods
They say I ain't bad
I'm the best that I've had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life
Just to prove that I was right

Terrestrial fire
Ascending from underground
Godspeed divine
So we control the mound

Shape shifter
Spirits whisper
Guide me through this black sorcery

Flashing teeth
Aggressive tendencies
Cloaked beneath
Silver redeems

Smoking mirrors
Black obsidian
Tell us where to find the marrow

The prophecy
Will be realized
Lord of the near and the nigh
Possessor of earth and sky

Guard your temples
From destruction
Make sure no one goes inside

The prophecy
Will be realized
Lord of the near and the nigh
Possessor of earth and sky

It's right in front of me
The throne of maladies
It's right in front of me
Your malignancy
