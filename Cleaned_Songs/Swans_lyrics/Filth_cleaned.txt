// Power For Power //

Use sex for control
Use power for power
Use hate for freedom
Use money for cruelty

Take control and keep it

Don't let go

They were wrong, they were wrong
They were wrong, they were wrong
Turn against them

Take control and keep it

Don't let go
Don't let go

// Freak //

Come here you freak, I saw you crawling last night
Big erection in your hand, you rule the world
You're gonna murder somebody weak
You're gonna murder Somebody weak
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse

I'm not scared, I'll take what I want
Something for nothing, I want what you've got
I want what you've got

// Weakling //

I don't feel pain
I never escape
I'm under the bed
I'm licking the floor
I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
Not real

You know everything 
I forgot how to breathe
You're touching my chest
When I'm touched I bleed
I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real

// Gang //

Cut out the infection
Beat up the violator
Gag him and screw him down
Screw him down
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail

Knock him down
Knock him down
Cut off his deception
Cut off his deception
Murder his influence
Rape his memory
Rape his memory
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
Hammer the nail, hammer the nail
