Album: NewMind

// New Mind //

In the place
Where no one knows
Where they were before
Or what they're doing where
They are now
I will be there
With my eyes wide open
I will be there
(I will be there)
I will be ready
To receive
The new mind
Now I am a man
Now I am a man
But I'm nothing now
And God is mine
Yeah God is mine
Yeah my sin is me
And God is mine
Now I am ready
Now I am ready
To receive
The new mind
Now people get ready
People get ready
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
I will be there
I will be there
When he calls my number I will be there
Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Let the light come in
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul

// Damn You To Hell //

Oh Jesus
You're my only god
If I kissed you I lied
You are mine only mine
You are mine only mine

The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
The sex in your soul will damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Now save your soul
Damn you to hell
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul
Save your soul

// I'll Swallow You //

I love myself
I was made for myself
If I kissed you I lied
I am made to be admired
You made a mistake
When you pressed your lips to mine
I inhale what I see
I steal what I breathe
You are mine only mine
You are mine only mine
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
You are mine only mine
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
I will swallow you
