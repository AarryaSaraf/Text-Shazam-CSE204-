// God Bless The Child //

God bless the child, the child that's got his own
Them that's got shall get
them that's not you lose
So the bible says and it still is news
mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own

Yes, the strong gets more
while the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own

When you've got money
you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When it's gone spending ends
They don't come no more
Which relations give, crust of bread and such
You can help yourself but don't take too much

mama may have, papa may have
but God bless the child that got it's own
God bless the child that got it's own

// She's Funny That Way //

Not much to look at,  nothing to see
I'm glad I'm living, and I'm lucky to be
But I got a woman crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

ain't got a dollar, can't save a cent
She never holler, she'd live in a tent
I've got that woman mad about me
She's funny that way

 Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
 She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her?, Why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that woman crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

I've got that woman mad about me

she's funny that way

// I've Got A Right To Sing The Blues //

I've got a right to sing the blues,
got the right to moan and sigh
I've got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

A certain girl in this old town
keeps dragging my heart around
All I see for me is misery

I've got the right to sing the blues
got the right to moan and cry
I've got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

Call it love say what you choose
I've got a right to sing the blues
I've got a right, got a right,
got a right to sing the blues
got the right to moan and sigh
got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

Soon that deep blue sea
is gonna be calling me
Call it love, say what you choose
I've got a right to sing the blues
the blues, the blues, the blues
I've got a right to sing the blues

// Good Morning, Heartache //

Good morning heartache
you ole gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you were gone
Now here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by daying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
can't shake you, know how
just leave me alone
I've got the Monday blues
straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache
Here we go again
Good morning heartache
you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

// T' Aint Nobody's Bizness (If I Do) //

There ain't nothing I can do
or nothing I can say
Just what I want to anyway
And I don't care just what people may say
And if I, if I take a notion
the jump-off into the ocean
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do
And if I go to church on sunday
then cabaret all day monday
It ain't nobody's bizness if I do

if my baby ain't got no money
and I say take all of mine honey
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do
If I give my baby my last nickle, O
and it leaves me, leaves me in a pickle
it ain't nobody's bizness if I do
I'd rather from my baby to hit me
then to jump off and quit me
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do
Nobody's bizness if I do

// Comes Love //

Come a rain storm put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm you can get a little heat
Comes love nothing can be done
Comes a fire then you know just what to do
Blow a tire You can buy another shoe
Comes love nothing can be done
Don't try hidin? 
'Cause there isn't any use
You'll start slidin? 
When your heart turns on the juice
Comes a headache you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache see the dentist right away
Comes love nothing can be done!

Comes a heat wave you can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons you can hide behind the door
Comes love Nothing can be done
Comes the measles you can quarantine the room
Comes a mousie you can chase it with a broom
Comes love nothing can be done
That's all brother
If you've ever been in love
That's all brother
You know what I'm speaking of!
Comes a nightmare you can always stay awake
Comes depression you may get another break
Comes love nothing can be done!

// Lover Girl //

I don't know why
but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something
I've never had
Never had no kissin', o
what I've been missing
Lover girl, o where can you be

The night is cold
and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul
just to call my own
got a moon above me
but no one to love
Lover girl, o where can you be

I've heard it said
that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a pruger?
that you make love to me
Strange as it seems
someday we'll meet
and you dry all my tears
then whisper sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and kissing
oh what we've been missing
Lover girl, o where can you be
Lover girl, o where can you be

// Let's Call The Whole Thing Off //

You say either, I say either
You say neither, I say neither
either, either
neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off

You like potatoes, I like potatoes
You like tomatoes, I like tomatoes
Potatoes, potatoes
tomatoes, tomatoes
Let's call the whole thing off

And if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And if we ever part
that might break my heart

You wear pajamas, I wear pajamas
I wear pajamas and give up pajamas
And for we know we need each other so
We better call the calling off off
Better call the whole thing off

And if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And if we ever part
that might break my heart

If you like oysters, I like oysters
I order oyster and cancel the oyster
And for we know we need each other so
We better call the calling off off
Better call the whole thing off

// Lover, Come Back To Me //

The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new, and so was love
The eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, lover where can you be

You came at last, love had his day
That day is past, you gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, lover come back to me

When I remember every thing you used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder, no wonder, I am lonely

The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new, but love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, lover come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me
Lover, lover come back to me

// Solitude //

In my solitude you haunt me
with memories of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
with memories that never die
I sit in my chair, I feel despair
No one can be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude I pray
dear Lord above send back my love

// They Can't Take That Away From Me //

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
They can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way your haunt my dreams
They can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we dance 'til three
The way you changed my life
No, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

// Crazy In Love With You //

I say I'll move the mountains
and I'll move the mountains
if she wants them out of the way
crazy she calls me
sure I'm crazy
crazy in love I say

I say I'll go through fire
and I'll go through fire
as she wants it so it shall be
crazy she calls me
sure I'm crazy
crazy in love you see

like the winds shakes the bows
she moves me with a smile
the difficult I'll do right now
the impossible will take a little while
I say I care forever and I care forever
If I have to hold up the sky
crazy she calls me
sure I'm crazy
crazy in love am I

[background singers]
I say I care forever and I'll care forever
If I have to hold up the sky

crazy she calls me
sure I'm crazy
crazy in love am I
