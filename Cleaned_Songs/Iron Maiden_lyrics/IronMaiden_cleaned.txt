// Prowler //

Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!

Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around

Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around

Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!

Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around

// Sanctuary //

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Love me tonight

// Remember Tomorrow //

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)

// Running Free //

Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

Get out of my way, hey

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free

Right?

Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free
Oh

I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

// Phantom Of The Opera //

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah

I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

Torture me back at your lair

// Strange World //

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh

Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old

Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh

// Charlotte The Harlot //

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?

Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

// Iron Maiden //

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
