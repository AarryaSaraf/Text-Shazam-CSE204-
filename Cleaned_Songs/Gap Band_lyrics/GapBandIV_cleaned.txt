// Early In The Morning //

Oh, I never, you know I loved you till you left me
Oh, I never, you know I cared till you were gone
I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I lost you till you're gone
Oh, I never, knew I loved you till you were gone

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
Gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

Now I gotta get up early every morning
'Cause the early bird always catches the worm
Now I gotta get up every morning
Gotta make up for the lesson I've learned
Gotta find me a lover that won't run for cover
Gotta find me a lover that won't run the mother

'Cause I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I lost you till you're gone
She had a pretty face that drove me wild
I even wanted her to have my child

Early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

(Team say it)
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover

(Ladies just sing it one time, sing ladies)
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover
Gotta find me another lover

Early in the mornin'

// Season's No Reason To Change //

Snowballs rolling down the mountainside
The sun come around melting the snow away
Girl, I've been gone for such a long, long time

// Lonely Like Me //

You don't know me and I don't know you, but

Two people wondering, looking, searching for a fantasy

// Talkin' Back //

One fat hen, a couple of ducks
Three brown bears, four running hares
Five fat Emilies
(You gonna dance)
Six simple Simons sittin' on a stump
Seven Siamese sailors sailin' the seven seas
Eight egotistical egotists
Eekin' in and out of existence
Nine nibblin' nibblin' Nubians
Nibblin' nibblin' gnats, knuckles and nicotine
Ten tenacious turnabouts
Tenaciously tracking through
Thickly Thackeray Timber Town!
