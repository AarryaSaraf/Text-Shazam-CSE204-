// Skin O'my Teeth //

I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit-and-run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet-brained neighbor cranes
His neck to see
In time, the white light's, a train
Bearing down on me

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

I won't feel the hurt
I'm not trash any longer
That, that doesn't kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
That's what 9-1-1 is for
So tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh, to close the drawer

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

// Symphony Of Destruction //

You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a-roll
A-roll, A-roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, Explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A-warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A-tall, A-tall

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

// Architecture Of Aggression //

Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Praise your architecture of aggression

Ensuing power vacuum, a toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss - the other, genocide
Time to pay with your ass, a worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies...
Praise your architecture of aggression

// Foreclosure Of A Dream //

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end, ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland dies, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

"The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, read my lips... read my lips."

Now with new hope, some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed, or dividend. Some may ask "Why?"
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Holocaust

// Sweating Bullets //

Hello me, meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark, black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

Hello me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache, sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations

Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

I hear it in hear...
Blood stains on my... hands
The big axe...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating

Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day, you too will know my pain
And smile its "black-tooth grin"
If the war inside my head won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me, and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and I don't know where I've been

Once you've committed me (Committed me)
Now you've acquitted me (Acquitted me)
Claiming validity (Validity)
For your stupidity (Stupidity)
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Oh, here I come again, whoa!
Sweating bullets

// This Was My Life //

It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right

There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do

Lying on your bed
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits

Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin

Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay

Lying on your bed
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits

Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

In our life there is "if"
In our beliefs there is "lie"
In our business there is "sin"
In our bodies there is "die"

This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
This was my fate

// Countdown To Extinction //

Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned...

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is "lairs"
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous...

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

"One hour from now, another species of life form will disappear off the face of the planet... forever, and the rate is accelerating"

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

// High Speed Dirt //

Do it if you dare, leaping from the sky
Hurling through the air, exhilarating high
See the Earth below, soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death, I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear, feel velocity gain
Entering a near catatonic state
Pressure of the sound roaring through my head
Crash into the ground, damned if I'll be dead

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt

Jump or die!

Dropping all my weight, going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins, faster as I go
I forgot my name, I'm a dirt torpedo

High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt

// Psychotron //

Psychotron...

Assassin in stealth, assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage
Computer on-board, engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Burning inside, godspeed in glide
Battle plan running
A killing machine, just downright mean
And forever cunning

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Target to destroy, arms in employ
Full assault fire threat
Sensors indicate you will terminate
Life systems disconnect

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Psychotron
Psychotron
Psychotron
Psychotron...

// Captive Honour //

Madness comes and madness goes
An insane place with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules

Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... ooh, oh, you're a God!

"Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury; have you reached a verdict?"
"Yes, we have, your honour. We find the defendant guilty, on all counts, for crimes against all humanity."
"By virtue of the jury's decision and the power vested in me by the state, I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole... for life."
"Life?! What do you mean life?! I ain't got a life!"
"Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus. Mhmm, 'cause your ass belongs to me... [*laughing*]"

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions, no time for games
Start kicking ass and taking down the names
A long shit list, a shorter fuse
He is untouchable, and guarantees you'll lose

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the big house, his nightmare unfolds
Before he got there, his manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome, this tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death, it can't be worse than this!

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Captive honour, ain't no honour

// Ashes In Your Mouth //

People have round shoulders from bearing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

If you're fighting to live
It's okay to die
The answer to your question is:
"Welcome to tomorrow."

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
