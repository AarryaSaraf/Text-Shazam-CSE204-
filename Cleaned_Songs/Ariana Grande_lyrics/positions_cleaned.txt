Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it (Oh yeah)

Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light (Oh)

// off the table //

Will I ever love the same way again?
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't mean to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?

Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life?
Am I too cold, am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be going too steady
But I just wanna know, is love completely off the table?

Will you be there?
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I?)
Not yet healed already (Not ready)
Should I be going too steady (Too steady)
Just wanna know, is love completely off the table?

I'll wait for you, even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it

I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then, I was toxic and then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills, oh yeah
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Will you be there? (Yes, I will be there for ya)
Can I still love you? (Yes, I been hurt before, before)
Not yet healed already (Not ready)
Should I be going too steady (Too steady)
Just wanna know, is love completely off the table?

So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me?
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head
Trying to be here from this bed
Just wanna know, just wanna know know know, baby

Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby?
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him thankfully
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again, babe

Will you be there? Will you be there?
(I'll still wait, I'll still wait for you baby)
Can I still love you?
Not yet healed already (Not ready)
Should I be going too steady (No, no, no)
Just wanna know, is love completely off the table?

I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh-ooh

And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay
Even if one day, you lose it and go crazy

The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up (Ah-ah-ah, babe)

Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again

Others that I've had had to impress me before (Ooh)

Still getting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah

Pull up, pull up on me, ah

Give you a set of keys 'cause you own it
Pull up, pull up on me, ayy

Ain't lookin' back unless it's right at you

Make me wanna stay through the night
I will never leave from by your side
Don't you know you got a ride or die? Ah
Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know

No, I don't feel the need to
Test drive nothin', test drive nothin'
Baby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta
Test drive nothin' (Oh), test drive nothin' (My baby)
It's in the way you do it, I don't ever gotta, baby

If you want, say, "I do" (I do)

Just say the word, you know I'm yours (Know I'm yours)
Just drop a pin and don't reverse (Oh)

Make me wanna stay through the night (Oh, babe)
I will never leave from by your side (Leave from by your side)
Don't you know you got a ride or die? Ah
Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know

No, I don't feel the need to
Test drive nothin' (No, babe), test drive nothin'
Baby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta
Test drive nothin', test drive nothin'

// worst behavior //

I've been on my worst behavior
But baby, I don't need no savior
I'm way outta line
But I kind of like the way I
Feel when I just don't give a fuck
Oh, I forgot to mention
I'll be there in five

We don't really need to talk too much
Show each other what we know
I got other ways to catch you up
Couldn't do it on the phone
So can you keep it secret?

This ain't no game won't play with you (Oh hey)
This time I know I'll stay with you
Just promise you won't say nothin'
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
No phone, no pics, no postin' us
This love just ain't disposable
Just take what's yours, don't run from it
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe

Said baby it's just in my nature (Oh-oh)
To be a little troublemaker
So wrong but so right
Know you really like the way I
Taste when we kiss, you reminisce
But this ain't the last time
Just stay by my side

We don't really need to talk too much (Too much)
Show each other what we know (Know, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I got other ways to catch you up (To catch you up)
Couldn't do it on the phone (The phone)
So can you keep it secret?

This ain't no game won't play with you (Oh, babe)
This time I know I'll stay with you (Stay with you)
Just promise you won't say nothin' (Won't say nothin')
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe (Baby)
No phone, no pics, no postin' us (Postin' us)
This love just ain't disposable (Oh, babe)

Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe

// main thing //

You on your way, it's a Friday night
Hear the rain outside, yeah
It's rosé on ice
Candlelight and I'm feeling nice
Anything you like, boy, you know it's on me
Been a minute since I tasted something so sweet

Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah, you never keep me waitin', waitin'
Got me trippin', I adore you
I adore you, boy (Boy)
Oh baby

You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby (Main thing, baby)

It's time to go, take it nice and slow
Tiptoe to the bedroom, lookin' at me like when it's cold
You gon' keep me warm
All I wanna do is spend my time with you
Even when the learning's done and nothing's new

Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah, you never keep me waitin', waitin'
Got me trippin', I adore you
I adore you, boy (Boy)
Oh baby

You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby
You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby (Main thing, baby)
