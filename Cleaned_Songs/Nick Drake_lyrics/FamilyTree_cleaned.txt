// Way To Blue //

Don't you have a word to show what may be done
Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue?

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
If you know the way to blue?

Look through time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind.

Can you now recall all that you have known?
Will you never fall
When the light has flown?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue?

// Day Is Done //

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought 
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

// Come Into The Garden (Introduction) //

It in a bright red sky
In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man weep

// They're Leaving Me Behind //

The tramp moves on to the end of the street
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind.

The world humes on at its breakneck pace
People fly in their lifelong race
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind.

The chances they come, but the chances have been lost
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind.

The wind sweeps up and goes back to its tree
The rain flows by and moves to the sea
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind.

// Time Piece //

Still it's time that grows in my brain.
Still it's time that calls me here.
Still I scream when time ticks.
Still I cringe from time's tricks.
Still I groan for time's loves.
But still I'll try for time perhaps.

// Poor Mum //

Poor mum
Poor mum
After a lifetime of dreaming
Poor mum
Poor mum
Whatever became of your scheming
Nothing worked out in the way that you planned
Nothing was quite as you thought
Try very hard not to misunderstand
Joy as it flies cannot be caught
Poor mum
Poor mum
Where did you take a wrong turning
Poor mum
Poor mum
Pack up that last little yearning
Pack it away with the books and the toys
Silent and bound
Silent and mend
Go out and grab at you life and forget
You are poor, poor mum

// Winter Is Gone //

Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves turn green
Your innocent face
I wish I never had seen

Come on, my love
And pay the world
Come on, my love
And pay the world
You cheated me
But I wish you well

Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
An innocent man
This day will be hung

Come on, my love
And see me die
Come on, my love
And see me die
See me dancing
Dancing neath the sky
'Neath those gallows high
Come on and see me die

Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Your innocent face
I wish I never had seen

// All My Trials //

I had a little book
Was give to me
And every page
Spoke of liberty

All my trials
Will soon be over

There is a tree
In paradise
The pilgrims call it
The tree of life

All my trials
Will soon be over

But it's too late, my friend

Too late
But never mind

All my trials
Will soon be over

If religion were a thing
That money could buy
Then the rich would live
And the poor would die

All my trials
Will soon be over

All my trials
Will soon be over

// Strolling Down The Highway //

Strolling down the highway
I`m gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway

People think I'm a crazing
Lord above they're lazing
Sunshine's all day long
The garlic's far too strong
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway

Cars won't stop for no one
But don't you think that you're just rolling down
I think you are a spy
shoot them as they go by
Well, no cars no cars
Won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway

// Cocaine Blues //

Yonder comes my baby dressed in blue,
hey baby, whatcha gonna do,
cocaine, all around my brain

Yonder comes my baby dressed in white,
hey baby, gonna stay all night
cocaine, all around my brain

hey baby, come here quick,
this old cocaine's gonna make me sick
cocaine, all around my brain

went to be last night and the lights was on
woke up this morning, and my nose was gone,
cocaine, all around my brain

this cocaine's for horses, it ain't for men
the doc says it'll kill me, but he don't say when
cocaine, all around my brain

come here baby, come here quick,
this old cocaine's gonna make me sick,
cocaine's, all around my brain.

// Blossom //

Black days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky
And I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom.

The seasons cycle turned again
An april shower now and then
Trees came alive
And the bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom.

People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun.

The nights grew warm, the days grew long
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine
All the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom.

When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do
Find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom.

// Been Smoking Too Long //

Well I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
It's way past noon time
Now I'm late for work.

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long.

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good.

Tell me Tell Me...

I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me Tell me...

Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin'
Try not to see myself.

Tell me Tell me...

Well in this blues I'm singin'
There's a lesson to be learned
Don't go around smokin'
Unless you want to get burned.

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Everything going wrong with me
Must be I've been smoking too long.

// Black Mountain Blues //

Old black mountain
Tried to spit in your face
Old black mountain
Tried to spit in your face
Baby's grubbing whiskey
Oh, she's practicing

Old black mountain
Mean as they can be
Old black mountain
Mean as they can be
They use gunpowder
Just to sweeten the tea

Had a girl in black mountain
Sweetest girl in town
Had a girl in black mountain
Sweetest girl in town
But she met a sweet black man
And then she threw me down

Well, old black mountain
Can't keep man in jail
Old black mountain
Can't keep man in jail
Sure we call him guilty
Judge will cry and bail

Come back to black mountain
Me, my razor and my gun
Come back to black mountain
Me and my razor, my gun
Gonna cut her if she stands there
And shoot her if she runs

// Tomorrow Is A Long Time //

If today were not an endless highway
If tonight were not a crooked trail
If tomorrow weren't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the water
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Can't remember the sound of my own name

And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear he heart softly pound
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd sleep in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver, singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
None of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
And she could lie in my bed once again

// If You Leave Me //

Believe me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night

Believe me, pretty mama
Better take your picture too
Don't want to remember
What a good looking girl can do

Don't send me no letter
Don't write me no postcard
Thinking about you, baby
Makes it twice as hard

Believe me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night

Well I'm sitting here
On the sudden
Watching the trees go by
My baby, at the end of the depot
Lay me down and cry

Believe me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night

// Here Come The Blues //

Monday is shining
You know 'em tuesday's rain
Well, the days go by me
Like a southbound train
Yes, it's funny thinking
You will never call my name

Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues

Well, the world's the same old comedy
You know my time is cold
Nothing new, blue lady
I won't get old
'cause the deal is gone now
I'd just better hold

Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues

Well, sun has run down

She has gone out to hide
Yes, and now I'm out walking
Where the midnight ride
Just me and the good-time charlies
And the suicide

Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues

Well, monday's dry
Yes, and tuesday's just the same
Maybe come down blue wednesday
I'm gonna grab the brakes again
'cause no bottle of pills
Could ever kill this pain

Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues

Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues

// Blues Run The Game //

Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone, the blues I'd to sing

Go bring me whiskey, baby
Go bring me gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service
Me and room service, well we're living like a sin

When I'm not drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I'm not sleeping
When I'm not sleeping
When I'm not sleeping, well you know, you'll find me crying

Try another city, baby
Try another town
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game

Well maybe someday, baby
Somewhere down the line
I'll wake up older, honey
So much older
I'll wake up older and just stop all my trying

Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game

// My Baby's So Sweet //

Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet

My baby don't you go
Ain't seen my little sugar come home
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet

But my baby she'd long gone
But I've seen her - I must've been doing her wrong
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet

See my baby, don't act so smart
I'll cut out your liver, and eat your heart
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet

Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet

// Milk And Honey //

Gold and silver is the autumn
Soft and tender are her skies
Yes and no are the answers
Written in my true love's eyes

Autumn's leaving and winter's coming
I think that I'll be moving along
I've got to leave her and find another
I've got to sing my heart's true song

Round and round the burning circle
All the seasons: one, two, and three
Autumn leaves and then there winter
Spring is born and wanders free

Gold and silver burns my autumns
All too soon they'd fade and die
And then I'd know, there'd be no others
Milk and honey were their lies

// Kimbie //

Kimbie wants a nine dollar show
Kimbie wants a nine dollar show
She wants a nine dollar show
And I need
Well Kimbie let your hair hang down
Kimbie let your hair hang down

Let your hair hang down
Til it touches the ground
Well Kimbie let your hair hang down

Kimbie let your hair hang down
Let your hair hang down
Cause come the morning I'll be gone
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well Kimbie where you been so long
I've been down in your state pen
With those rough and rowdy
Rough and rowdy men
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well Kimbie where you been so long
I've been down in your state pen
And I gotta go back again
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well I wished I was a mole in the ground
I wished I were a mole in the ground
I was a mole in the ground
And that I'd tear this mountain
I'd tear this mountain down
Wished I was a mole in the ground

// Bird Flew By //

Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was wise enough to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season

Your life flies away
As the night turns to day
If you start once to think
Your hair will soon turn grey
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season

The list of fallen stars
And crumbled, broken hearts
Comes from a need
To play so many parts
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season

The wind and the rain
Shook hands again
Untouched by the world
They managed to keep sane
They were able to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season

Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was wise enough to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season

// Rain //

Thoughts of rain at sunset
Clouds of rainbow blue
Thoughts of sun on sand-dunes
Where the seabirds flew
This was our season, and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain.

Thoughts of leaves in autumn
Falling from the trees
Thoughts of horizon tree tops
Leading to the sea
This was our season, no lies and no pretend
But my love left with the rain.

Thoughts of springtime rainfall
Touching flowers that bend
Thoughts of wind in willows
Days that never end
This was our season, but sorrow waited round the bend
For my love left with the rain.

Rain's the way you move now
Sun the way you seem
Leaves the way you wonder
Flowers the way you dream
This was our season, and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain

// Strange Meeting II //

Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand.

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand.

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand.

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone. of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand.

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and I'll hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sand.

// Come Into The Garden //

In the bright red sky
In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man weep
She said her dreams were too far to be thought of
Her scars too wide to heal
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel
She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man pray
She wished them luck as they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moon

// Do You Ever Remember? //

Do you ever remember
Now you're so far away
Things that we used to laugh about
Crazy things we'd say
There were so many may times
When every word was a song
There were so many gay times
Before it all went oh so wrong
But time is ever a vagabond
Time was always a thief
Time can steal away happiness
But time can take away grief
So I won't try to remember
For that way leads to regret
No I won't try to remember
What I can never forget
