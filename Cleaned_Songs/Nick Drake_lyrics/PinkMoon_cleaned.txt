Album: PinkMoon

// Pink Moon //

I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get you all

It's a pink moon
It's a pink moon
Pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon

The pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon

I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get you all

It's a pink moon
It's a pink moon

// Place To Be //

When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place

And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be

And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh, so weak in this need for you

// Road //

You can say the sun is shining if you really want to
I can see the moon and it seems so clear
You can take the road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through.

You can take a road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through.

// Which Will //

Which will you go for?
Which will you love?
Which will you choose from
From the stars above?

Which will you answer?
Which will you call?
Which will you take for
For your one and all?

And tell me now
Which will you love the best?

Which do you dance for?
Which makes you shine?
Which will you choose now
If you won't choose mine?

Which will you hope for?
Which can it be?
Which will you take now
If you won't take me?

And tell now
Which will you love the best?

// Things Behind The Sun //

Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while
Your time away

And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth

Your night or your day

Who'll hear what I say?

Look around you find the ground
Is not so far from where you are
But don't be too wise

For down below they never grow
They're always tired and charms are hired
From out of their eyes

Never surprise

Take your time and you'll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see what's meant to be
Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before

Don't be shy you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done
If only you see

Just what you are beneath a star
That came to stay one rainy day
In autumn for free

Yes, be what you'll be

Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while
Your time away

And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth
Your night or your day

Who'll hear what I say

Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes that's today
And open wide the hymns you hide
You'll find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what you'll say

About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people round your head
Who say everything's been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain

// Know //

Know that I love you
Know I don't care
Know that I see you
Know I'm not there

// Parasite //

Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two

I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you might see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt

// Ride //

I know you, I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball

But hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?
Hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?

I know too what you do
When you're through
Counting the cattle as they go by the door
Keeping a carpet that's so thick on the floor

But hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?
Hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?

I know you, I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball

But hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?
Hear me calling
Won't you give me a free ride?

// Harvest Breed //

Falling fast and falling free, you look to find a friend
Falling fast and falling free, this could just be the end
Falling fast, you stoop to touch and kiss the flowers that bend
And you're ready now for the harvest breed

// From The Morning //

A day once dawned and it was beautiful
A day once dawned from the ground
Then the night she fell and the air was beautiful
The night she fell all around

So look, see the days
The endless coloured ways
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning

And now we rise and we are everywhere
And now we rise from the ground
And see she flies, and she is everywhere
See she flies all around

So look, see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning
