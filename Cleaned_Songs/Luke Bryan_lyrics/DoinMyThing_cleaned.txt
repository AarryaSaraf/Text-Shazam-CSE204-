Album: DoinMyThing

// Rain Is A Good Thing //

My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss kick the dust, sayin' son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talkin'; that's the best love we made
Yea where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they wanna cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing

// Doin' My Thing //

I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along

[Chorus]
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by

[Chorus]
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

I like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow layin' low
Rolling anywhere the wind may blow

[Chorus]
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry

I'm just doin' my thing

// Do I //

Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day

I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way

What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days

There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?

// What Country Is //

There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
And when they're gone, take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with
That's what country is

That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is

// Someone Else Calling You Baby //

I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on
It'll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?

// Welcome To The Farm //

We've been up here in this city
Livin' in the gears that grind
Girl, it's a doggone pity
We ain't been gettin' anytime

I've been preachin' 'bout back home
How it can make you feel so alive
Tell you what we can do
Baby, let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

There ain't no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everythin' around here
That's just the way it's been for so long

How'd you like a coke from a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

Pine straw in your hair
Not an ounce of makeup on you
As the sun goes down
Girl, I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

Right there's and old step side
How 'bout that blue sky?
So pretty it'll make you cry
(Welcome to the farm)

We can roll on over yonder
Or sit right here and ponder
Watch the wind whirl by

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

// Apologize //

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]

I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

// Every Time I See You //

It's like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you, every time I see you

Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard
Would love a good break but they feel it too
Every time I see you, why I gotta see you?

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like a early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you, yeah

Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood

I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Every time I see you, oh yeah

Oh, I'm walking down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you

// Chuggin' Along //

Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

[Chorus]
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back

[Chorus x2]

Keep chuggin' along
Yea keep chuggin' along

// I Did It Again //

It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned and two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man I took hold of that can

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I guess, I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I ain't no quitter

The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah, things got out of hand at that party
I said, "That's it, it's 'bout time I grow up"
But that next weekend, I called all my friends

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do

Yeah, what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
I done, done it again, I did it again

// Drinkin' Beer And Wastin' Bullets //

Out in the sticks with the squirrels and the ticks
And my 30-06, I'm runnin' out of Miller Lite
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishin' one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killed's a twelve pack

Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
Well I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

The only deer I've seen's been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
'Cause ain't no boss callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off on the edge of this cornfield
on my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck but it's been a good day

Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
Well I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
Well I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

Sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
