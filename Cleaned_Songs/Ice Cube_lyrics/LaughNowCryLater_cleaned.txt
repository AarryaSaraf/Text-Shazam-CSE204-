Definition Of A West Coast G

// Why We Thugs //

[Intro]

Yeah

Every hood's the same [2X]

Come on

[Chorus]

They give us guns and drugs

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

They wanna count the slugs

Then come around here and fuck with us (Uh huh)

They give us guns and drugs

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

They wanna count the slugs

Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]

I'm from the land of the gang bang

Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed

It's the same ol same

Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien

I cock and aim, clinically insane

To deal with this bullshit day to day

If I sell some yay or smoke some hay

You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay

Call me an animal up in the system

But who's the animal that built this prison

Who's the animal that invented lower living

The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons

Thank god for Sugarhill

I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill

Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids

How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

It's boyz in the hood, it's toys in the hood

Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood

Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood

Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood (For real)

Cause when niggaz get tribal

It's all about survival, nobody liable

I got caught by five-oh

Grandmama came to court with her Bible

But when the judge hit the gavel

Now I'm too far from my family to travel (Fuck)

I just came unraveled

Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Owned by C.A, State Property

Just like the year fifteen fifty three

Looking for me, a one-way ticket out

Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

(Damn) I can't take the pressure

Pulled the fo-fo up out the dresser

Grabbed the weight up out the closet

Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it

Can't tell you niggaz what the fucking boss did

The game got a nigga exhausted

Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered

Twenty years for what?

Breaking these laws that's so corrupt

Taking these halls and filling 'em up

Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt

Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck

Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

In the hood, don't press your luck

Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

[Chorus]

[Outro]

Every hood's the same [3X]

Every hood's the same [2X]

Stop tripping on it

Every hood's the same [3X]

Every hood's the same [2X]

// Smoke Some Weed //

[Ice Cube]

Ice Cube motherfucker

West coast motherfucker


George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton

Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley

Rick James, knew how to throw a party

"Smoke some weed!"

Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech & Chong

Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong

Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling

"Smoke some weed!"

[Chorus: Ice Cube]

This is West coast nigga thinking

California quicksand got a nigga sinking

I can give a fuck what you niggaz drinking

"Smoke some weed!"

This is West coast nigga thinking

California quicksand got a nigga sinking

I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking

"Smoke some weed!"

[Ice Cube]

If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer

Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers

Understand, that yo' life's in danger

Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers

Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler

Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger

Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers

I'm a nigga, that wanna bone T'Penga

G4, pull it up out the hanger

A lil' something, to fuel you niggaz anger

The swine, I'm your face rearranger

In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger

Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Spranger

I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer

I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya

Police, still get the middle fanger

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Lil' niggaz, don't try this at home

Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone

Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome

Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown

Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne

With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown

Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone

Go back to Africa used to be a theme song

I'm in the zone, do anybody got a zone

I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone

Youse a clone, who don't know the shit you on

Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone

I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron

You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone

Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home

Gorilla niggaz, here come King Kong

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Ice Cube motherfucker

West coast motherfucker

"Smoke some weed!"

All y'all rappers should kiss and make up

and start to wake up

cause the whole rap industry needs to shake up

you got million dollar niggaz killin' million dollar niggaz

bustin' outta Bentleys

wearin' chinchillasss

there you go again rollin' in your limo

comin' from the Grammy's shootin' out the window

I know the scripture

but there's something wrong with this picture

what you mad about

diamonds all in your mouth

no car, no niggaz house paid off

I never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off

boy, you a fool

or you just act crazy

or you a grown crack baby born in the 80's

to all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood

I'm gangsta!

I know when I got it good

[Hook]

Ain't no other kings in this rap thing

they siblings
