// A Nightmare To Remember //

[James LaBrie:]
A nightmare to remember
I'd never be the same
What began as laughter
So soon would turn to pain

The sky was clear and frigid
The air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget
And I bet I never will

Picture for a moment
The perfect irony
A flawless new beginning
Eclipsed by tragedy

The uninvited stranger
Started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride
And we made our way back home

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
Father and mother
Holding each other

Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night

Crushing glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights

Screams of terror
Pain and fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes

Sudden stillness
Wrapped in silence
No more screaming
No more cries

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Lying on the table in this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger: a man without a face

He said, "Son, do you remember?
Do you even know your name?"
Then he shined a light into my eyes
And said, "Take this for the pain."

Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling
Lost in this wonderful misery
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony

"Tell me does this hurt you?"
Said the faceless man
"Can you move all of your fingers?
Can you try your best to stand?"

I asked about the others, "Is everyone okay?"
He told me not to worry as he turned and looked away

Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling
Lost in this wonderful misery

In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony

[Mike Portnoy:]
Day after day and night after night
Replaying the events, did they ever see the red light?
Over and over, scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams

How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived, it's a blessing no one died
By the Grace of God above, everyone survived

[James LaBrie:]
Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
It will stay with us forever
A nightmare to remember!

// A Rite Of Passage //

[James LaBrie:]
Since the new world order
Played upon our fears
Spreading accusations
Of radical ideas
The brotherhood of wisdom
Strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets
Remain a mystery

[James LaBrie & Mike Portnoy:]
Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage

[James LaBrie:]
Men of wealth and power
Influence and faith
Philosophers and leaders
Are members of the trade
Bound by open honor
Like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union
Of esoteric thought

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone
A rite of passage

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state
A rite of passage
The seven stars, the rising sun
A perfect world, a new life has begun
A rite of passage

// Wither //

Let it out, let it out
Feel the empty space
So insecure
Find the words
And let it out

Staring down, staring down
Nothing comes to mind
Find the place
Turn the water into wine

But I feel I'm getting nowhere
And I'll never see the end

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me

Turn it on
Turn it on
Let the feelings flow
Close your eyes
See the ones you used to know

Open up open up
Don't struggle to relate
Lure it out
Help the memory escape
Still this barrenness consumes me
And I feel like giving up

So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me

I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

I drown in hesitation
My words come crashing down
And all my best creations
Burning to the ground
The thought of starting over
Leaves me paralyzed

Tear it out again
Another one that got away

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear

I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create
The world's what you create
Let it out, let it out

// The Shattered Fortress //

[X. Restraint]

Freedom calls my name
Serenity keeps me sane
Happiness, it dulls the pain!
Honest to see my place
Open to other ways
Willingness to understand!

Justice, but do not judge
Courtesy for others flaws
Kindness, it's not that hard!
Self-restraint of tongue and pen
Inventory, my daily friend
Analysis, let down your guard!

Look in the mirror
What do you see?
The shattered fortress
That once bound me

Faithful ascent through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

You're smart enough for me to trust
Go live your life now
Just keep these steps in your life
And you'll know how

If you're not sure, ask yourself
"Have I done to them
As I would have them do to me?"

Look in the mirror
What's that you see?
The shattered fortress
Fly now, be free!

Faithful ascent, through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

I once thought it better to be right
But now I have finally seen the light
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn from mistakes
I live with serenity now
Not self-righteous hate

[XI. Receive]

Help me be a channel of Thy peace!
That where there is hatred, I may bring love
That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness
That where there is discord, I may bring harmony
That where there is error, I may bring truth
That where there is doubt, I may bring faith

Now that you can see all you have done
(That where there is despair, I may bring hope
That where there are shadows, I may bring light)
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
(That where there is sadness, I may bring joy)
All your sins will help to make you strong
(That I may seek to comfort, rather than to be comforted
That I may seek to understand rather than to be understood)
And help you break right through the prison wall
(That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved
For it is by self-forgetting that one finds
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven)

Keep all of me
The desires that once burned me deep inside
Help me live today
And help to give me grace
To carry out your way
I am ready, help me be all I can be
I am ready, help guide me and keep me free

[XII. Responsible]

I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there!
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there!

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

// The Best Of Times //

Remember days of yesterday
How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had
I thought it would always last
Those summer days and west coast dreams
I wished would never end
A young boy and his father
Idol and best friend

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together
I'll never forget

The morning shows on the radio
The case of the missing dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude
The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
And when we weren't together
The hours on the phone

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever
The best of times

But then came the call
Our lives changed forever more
"You can pray for a change
But prepare for the end..."

The fleeting winds of time
Flying through each day
All the things I should've done
But time just slipped away
Remember: "Seize the Day"!
Life goes by in the blink of an eye
With so much left to say

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day!

Thank you for the inspiration
Thank you for the smiles
All the unconditional love
That carried me for miles
It carried me for miles
But most of all thank you for my life!

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day!

My heart is bleeding bad
But I'll be okay
Your spirit guides my life each day!

// The Count Of Tuscany //

Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way
I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die

Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I-
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candle light

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the English heir
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

"Now wait a minute, man!
That's not how it is!
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems

Please try to forgive!

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me

The Count of Tuscany!"
