// Mistletoe //

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you

With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know

And it led me to a miracle

Ayy, love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing: your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer

// The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) //

[Justin Bieber:]
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Usher & Justin Bieber:]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Justin Bieber:]
I just can't wait, yeah

[Mariah Carey:]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holdin' on to me so tight
What more can I do?
'Cause, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Justin Bieber & Mariah Carey:]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own (For my own, baby)
More than you could ever know (Oh no)
Make my wish come true (Come true)
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, baby

// Drummer Boy //

[Justin Bieber:]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes):]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Justin Bieber:]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

// Christmas Eve //

It's a holiday, yeah
Spend it with you, baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hanging stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today's all about Cupid, the mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for, it sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's

So land on top of your roof, them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you, them carols are singing
Japan to Peru, baby, me and you
This Christmas Eve

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, whoa)
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

You leave some cookies out, I'mma eat 'em all
Nobody can see me but you, it's so magical, oh-oh

// All I Want Is You //

Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

And I never wanna do this alone
Baby, I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays, yeah (Yeah)
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely, baby, want you to hold me, baby

And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

Wrapping gifts without you, babe's, like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay, yeah

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

All I want is you this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite (Can't eat, can't eat)
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference, and it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (And I pray)
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray

// Someday At Christmas //

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
