Album: NeverSayNeverTheRemixes

// Never Say Never //

[Justin Bieber:]
Never say never (Never, never, never)
(Pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up, pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up)
Yeah, yeah, never, -ever-ever-ever-ever, eh, eh-eh
(Pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up, pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up)

See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (Eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (Eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
(Never say it, never-never say it)

I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

'Cause there's just no turning back (Oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (Oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight (Never say never!)
I will fight 'til forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never (Never, never, never, never)

[Jaden (Justin Bieber):]
(Here we go!)
Guess who?
(J Smith and JB)
Uh-huh
(I gotcha, lil bro)
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood 
Let's go!
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land 
I'm gone

[Justin Bieber (Jaden):]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say it, never-never say it)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'til forever make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never

Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
And never say never (No, no, never say never)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Ne-Ne-Never say it)
Ne-Never say never
And never say never (Never, never, never)

// That Should Be Me (Remix) //

[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause, baby, I didn't

[Justin Bieber (Rascal Flatts) {Both}:]
{That should be me} holding your hand
{That should be me} making you laugh (Yeah)
{That should be me}, this is so sad
{That should be me}, that should be me (Ooh oh)
That should be me feeling your kiss (Feeling your kiss)
That should be me buying you gifts (Buying you gifts)
This is so wrong
I can't go on (I can't go on)
'Til you believe
{That that should be me}
That should be me (No, oh-oh, ooh)

[Rascal Flatts (Justin Bieber) {Both}:]
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
{Did you think that I wouldn't see you out} (at the movies?)
What you doing to me?
(You're taking him where we used to go)
(Now if you're tryna break my heart)
It's working 'cause you know that

[Justin Bieber (Rascal Flatts) {Both}:]
{That should be me} holding your hand (holding your hand)
{That should be me} making you laugh (Oh)
{That should be me}, this is so sad (This is so sad)
{That should be me, that should be me} (That should be me)
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
{This is so wrong}
{I can't go on}
'Til you believe ('Til you believe)
{That that should be me}

I need to know (I need to know)
Should I fight for love or disarm? (Should I fight for love)
It's getting harder to shield (It's getting harder to shield)
{This pain in my heart}
(Woo, hey yeah)
(Ooh-ooh)

{That should be me} holding your hand
{That should be me} making you laugh
{That should be me}, this is so sad (That should be me)
That should be me, that should be me
{That should be me feeling your kiss}
{That should be me buying you gifts} (That should be me)
{This is so wrong}
{I can't go on}
{'Til you believe}
{That that should be me}
Holding your hand, that should be me (Oh yeah)
The one making you laugh, oh baby (Oh-oh, baby)
Oh, that should be me (That should be me)
That should be me giving you flowers (That should be me)
That should be me talking for hours oh (I never should've let you go oh oh, oh baby)
That should be me (Ooh, bab)
That should be me (That should be me, yeah)

// Somebody To Love (Remix) //

[Justin Bieber:]
For you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch 'em play for you
For you I'd be (Whoa oh), running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are, step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody

[Usher:]
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but for you, I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or you can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
So baby, listen

[Justin Bieber & Usher:]
I just need somebody to love (Oh no no no no)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I just need somebody to love

[Justin Bieber:]
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, yeah

[Usher:]
But what I really want, I can't find 'cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh, find me somebody to love, oh

[Justin Bieber & Usher:]
I need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody to love
Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? I just need somebody to love
JB, you are, yeah man

// Up (Remix) //

[Justin Bieber:]
It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl, uh
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby, believe me

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

[Chris Brown:]
It's a big big world
And, girl, I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make those grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, oh, yeah

[Justin Bieber (Chris Brown):]

We can go nowhere but up
(Nowhere), nowhere but up

// Overboard (Live) //

[Miley Cyrus:]
Oh, hello everybody, how you guys doing tonight?

It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, whoa

So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya
Got me out here in the water and I

Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver
Whoa

// Runaway Love (Remix) //

[Raekwon:]
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta

[Justin Bieber:]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Kanye West:]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Raekwon:]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ..., the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

// Born To Be Somebody //

There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set free

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it, I can taste it
Change is, coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around (whoa)
This world can make you feel small (whoa)
They will not keep me down (whoa)
I was born to stand tall

I'm going all the way
I can feel it, I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Feel it
Believe it
Dream it
Be it

I was born to be somebody (born to be, yeah!)
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me (no, no, whoa)
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
And this world will belong to me
Yeah, yeah, oh
This world will belong to me
