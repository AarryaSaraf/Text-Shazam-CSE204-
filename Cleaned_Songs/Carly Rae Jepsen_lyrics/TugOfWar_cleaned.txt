Album: TugOfWar

// Bucket //

(There is a hole in your bucket)

Sun's out we got a beach day
Forget yourself say why don't we people watch?
Kids are playin' 'round in the sand

(Little boy crying)
Oh no, he's got some troubles
Got us laughing as he throws his shovel
Nothing's really going as planned

I don't know how we're going to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down

(Are you smiling?)
Look over my shoulder
See your laughter bubble over
Lately you've been working too hard

And I've been waiting to recognize
That sparkle that's in your eye
Those two dimples on your cheeks
The joy that lights the fire

I don't know how we're going to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down

There's a hole in my bucket
Dear Liza, Dear Liza
There's a hole in my bucket
Dear Liza, a hole

And I don't know how we're supposed to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down
I'll stay until the sun comes

I don't know how we're gonna build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down
'Til the sun comes down

(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)

// Tug Of War //

You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing

You seem to good
Too good to be true
I'm loving you longer
Longer than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight
I won't sleep a wink
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight
I will turn to drink
Wondering who you're screwing

Tug of war, sweet as sin
I let go, I fell in
Feel the pull, call your name
I'm alone, once again
Tug of war, sweet as sin
I let go, I fell in
Feel the pull, call your name
I'm alone, once again

You seem too...
You seem too good
Too good to be true
You're holding me stronger
Stronger than I'm used to

Don't go out with the boys tonight (You seem too good)
I won't sleep a wink (Too good to be true)
Wondering what you're doing
Don't go out with the girls tonight (I'm loving you longer)
I will turn to drink (Longer than I'm used to)
Wondering who you're screwing

Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight; I'm loving you longer)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Longer than I'm used to)
Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight)
Sweet as sin (You seem too good)
I let go (Too good to be true)
I fell in
Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight; you seem too good)
Call your name (I will turn to drink)
I'm alone
Once again (Too good to be true)

Tug of war, feel the pull
Tug of war, feel the pull

// Money And The Ego //

Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me
Make your arms a willow tree
And you can bend with me
Anywhere that I am going

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

Keep your eyes on me
And I'll look to you so I can see
What I am here for
Pull the wool over my eyes
Please kiss this day goodbye
Only you can get me going

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

Giving up is all you've got
And giving up is all you want
You hear yourself say you've lost the will, the power
Giving up is all you've got
And giving up is all you want
But don't be afraid to sit down in your shower
Stay in there for hours

Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

(Got to be sure there's more)
Money, and the money and the egos
(Got to be sure there's more)
Money, and the money and the egos

// Tell Me //

Tell me, baby, is it yes or no?
You've got a face that just don't show
What's going on inside?
Tell me
I swear, I'll take it on the chin
Don't sugarcoat where I fit in
What's going on?

Inside you, there's a room, a room with a door
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
Oh, I've got this love for you, but what is it for?
If you can hear me, then tell me

Last chance
Hold me in your arms and say
If you want this love to walk away
Tell me, and I'll say goodbye

Inside you, there's a room, a room with a door
I finally come knocking and I've been here before
Oh, I've got this love for you, but what is it for?
If you can hear me, then tell me

I'll make it easy
I'm counting to three
Am I something you want or someone you need?

Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you love me, baby
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you want me
Tell me that you love me

Tell me, darling won't you tell me
I'm begging you to tell me
Tell me and I'll say goodbye

// Heavy Lifting //

You undo me, I'm a happy mess
My dress slips to the floor and I pose
What an amateur
To be like this, exposed
You deny the other side of me
That strips good love away
And you kissed my mirror reflection
When I looked at me today

When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

The worlds collide
I see a side of you
I never saw before
We can work it out, let's talk it out
I want to know you more
Just decided that I'd like to side with you
Oh, every time
And if you ask me how I'm feeling now
You know I'm feeling fine

When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me, look at me the way you do

When you look at me the way you do
My fingers tingle
I can't breathe until we're skin on skin
When you look at me the way you do
My life moves in perfect motion
You're doing all the heavy lifting

Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me, look at me the way you do
Oh, look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do
Look at me the way you do

When you look at me the way you do
My

// Sunshine On My Shoulders //

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can't make me cry
Sunshine on the water that is so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give a day sure to make you smile

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I would give to you a day just like today
Ah if I had a song I could sing for you
I would sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine, ooh, sunshine
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine almost always makes me high

// Worldly Matters //

Hot pink skies
Twilight of the day
I think that I've been going 'bout this the wrong way
Kids on my street got it right, man
Barefoot hide and seek
My best friend, she lives up the road
Haven't talked to her in weeks

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all
No, not at all

I keep on walking
I stop ditching all my plans
I want to climb that cedar tree
And leave me in good hands
What happened to me
On the way to something higher?
What will be left when I have all that I desire?

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all
No, not at all
No, not at all

(Time got from me, I'm so sorry)
(I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Time got from me, I'm so sorry)
(I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)

// Sweet Talker //

(I can see)

Sweet talker, I'm not gonna stop you
You talk so sweet, and man, it's dribbling like honey
It's just one taste, I see what you're tryna to do
Ooh-ooh, yeah yeah
It's hot, stakes are getting higher
No love for free, man, it costs if you're the buyer
My life's for me, I see what you're tryna do
Oh-oh, c'mon

Lazy lover, won't you slide me through your
Slide me though your
Lazy lover, I will, slide me through your window and I'll give you
All the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryna to do

That's a nice a house
I like what you've done with the place
Your gingerbread and that greedy smile upon your face
I can see just what you're tryna do
Oh-oh, c'mon

Lazy lover, won't you slide me through your
Slide me though your
Lazy lover, I will, slide me through your window and I'll give you
All the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

But don't worry, I say get it over with
'Cause what you want to know
You've got it on your fingertips
Don't you ask for more
That wave just tumbles me 'round
'Til I'm lost somewhere, but baby
I can't make a sound

It's so unfortunate
But I've already been through this
And I can see just what you're tryna do (Oh, oh)
I can see just what you need to do (I've already been through this)
I can see (just what you're tryna do)

// Hotel Shampoos //

I survive on hotel shampoos
I'll be runnin' out soon
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more
Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought summer you'd be gone away again
Ooh, he's gone away again

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

I'm craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gone away again, hmm, he's gone away again
I'm driving in a sweet brand new car
I'm living the life of a superstar
I got my way again, hmm, I got my way again

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

He says that he don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all out pretty disguises
Work hard, oh, we work until we're sleepin'
And we sleep, but we're not dreaming
Oh, we sleep, but we're not dreaming
(Where's his love)
Where's his love? Where's his kisses?
He says, "Sorry babe, this has got away from me"
He's gone away from me

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right
I know he'll prove me right
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

// Sour Candy //

Sour candy endings
Coffee stained but aware
Oh, I'm so tangled up in my big sunglasses
And bed hungry, second-day fare

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

And I've been very cautious
Trying numbness instead of pain
All your humor makes me, makes me nauseous
What a twisted, twisted, twisted game

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

Oh, get yourself home
You leave him alone
On second thought, I regret the pink stiletto
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Sour candy endings
And I was barely even there

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad we went under
