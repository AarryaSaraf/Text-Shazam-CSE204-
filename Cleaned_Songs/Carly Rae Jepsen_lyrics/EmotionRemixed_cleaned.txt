// Run Away With Me (Velvet Sunrise Remix) //

You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out

Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep
We never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh
(Be there with you)

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out

Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ohh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, ohh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Ohh, ohh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold

// Run Away With Me (Y2K Remix) //

You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body

Oh baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, ooh
Run away with me, run away with me
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Ohh, ohh

Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (Oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (Just run away)
Run away with me (With me)
Baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

// Your Type (Skylar Spence Remix) //

I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine

But I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

I'm not the type of...

And I want you to miss me when I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

I'm not the type of
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head

But I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me, when I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Oh won't you come around to the spot that we met

I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you
I'll make time for you
I'll make time for you
Time for you

I love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head

I'm not the...

I'll make time for you (time for you)
I'll make time for you (time for you)

// I Really Like You (Blasterjaxx Remix) //

I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head when we're out of touch (out of touch)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Do you want me too? Do you want me too?
Do you want me too? Do you want me too?
Want me too, want me too, want me too
Want me, want me too

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head when we're out of touch (Out of touch)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Yeah

And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
Yeah!
