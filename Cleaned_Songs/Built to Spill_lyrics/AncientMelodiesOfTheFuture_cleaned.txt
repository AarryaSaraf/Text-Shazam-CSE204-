// Strange //

This strange plan is random at best
This strange, how much more can I take?
This strange change in atmosphere
And in gravity too, and its severity

This strange day is almost over
Just started to get sick of it

And it's strange but not all that strange
That it's strange, but what's so strange about that?
Yeah, it's strange, but why is that strange?
That it's strange, but oh well

This strange plan is random at best
This strange, how much more can I take?
This strange sound you said I said
You're not listening, or I'm not saying it right

This strange war of promises
Let's call us a truce and call it the truth

And it's strange, but not all that strange
Yeah, it's strange, but what's so strange about that?
Yeah, it's strange, but what isn't strange?
Yeah, it's strange, but oh well

// The Host //

They never feel
They don't even seem real
They never try
So why should I?

Something is wrong
Something invisible is gone
They never mind
So why should I?

Don't you get hurt?
Don't you ever need a cure?
Don't you get tired?
And why and why?

After awhile
After neither one arrives
They wont decide
So why should I?

When they hand it over, give it all away
Well, how can you explain?
When they hand it over, no one gets their way
No one gets their blame

Don't you get tired
Of everyone that you admire?
They'll never die
So why should I?

Something is wrong
Something invisible is gone
They never mind
So why should I?

When they hand it over, give it all away
Well, how can you explain?
When they hand it over, no one gets away
No one gets the blame

// In Your Mind //

The symptoms of our getting older
The problems that say we don't mind
That most of us never get over
The memories mingled with lies

Coincidence gave a confession
That no one's allowed to forget
I don't wanna give the impression
That predestination is set

The distance will increase the danger
Where certainty's never enjoyed
Regarded as equal yet stranger
Embark, then embrace, then destroy

Observing the process will change it
And afterwards even if you
Subconsciously rearrange it
It doesn't seem any less true

Remnants of thought disappearing
And even transcending concern
Disturbing but somehow endearing
Conditioned to never unlearn

And no one can tell me to listen
And no one can tell me what's right
'Cause nobody has my permission
And no one can see in your mind

In your mind
In your mind
In your mind

When magnifications explore
There slowly emerges a pattern
The details you normally ignore
You notice really what matters

There isn't a time or a place
Only an ebb and a flowing
A permanent repeating space
Occurring, connecting, and growing

And no one can tell me to listen
And no one can tell me what's right
'Cause nobody has my permission
And no one can see in your mind

In your mind
In your mind
In your mind

// Alarmed //

In the hurry of the past
I forgot to make it last
Simple choices made too fast
By a dye I didn't cast

I'm alarmed and I can't help from
Crashing onto this island we've become
Words for fighting, words for fun
They've all melted into one

On the tip of every tongue
Like the new name for the sun
I'm alarmed and I can't recover from
Crashing onto this island we've become

Alright now, don't decide about that now
Oh, how can you blame the only one?
Ever stay, ever stay, ever stayed around, and you would
Never say, never say all the harm's been done

And you were all so gone, oh so long, so long
Did you make it all wrong, so wrong?
Did you wait oh, so long, so long?
Did you take it all wrong, so wrong?

// Trimmed And Burning //

Take it on and take it over
Take in as much as you can see
I can almost think about it, but
I cant arrange for you to see

Didn't know what I'm afraid of
I had to learn it from a dream
There's a light that never goes out
Burning a hole inside of me

Keep your lamps all trimmed and burning
Might be alarmed with what you see
I've agreed to always love you
But never enough to set you free

// Happiness //

Haven't had a half a hand
It's half of what I am
Haven't heard of half the things
That happened in the past

Haven't given half the time to half the people
Half the things I've planned
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Haven't had the half of mind to stay
And start to take a stand
Haven't held on half as long as I had hoped
As I had hoped to plan

Happiness, half the shit they said I had
In half didn't have a chance
You don't have to be so cruel
'Cause all I do is a little less than what I can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

Happiness will only
Happen when it can
Happiness will only
Happen when it can

// Don't Try //

Your lie last night
You make time alright
Well, I might look twice
But don't try their kind

No, don't try their kind
They might seem fine
You're like sunshine
Inside, all mine

And everyone goes on and on
And everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on

Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on
Everyone goes on and on

Your lie last night
You make time alright
I might look twice
But don't try their kind

// You Are //

Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody

Everybody know
Everybody know
Everybody know
Everybody know

That you
That you
That you
That you are

// Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss //

I know you're making
Accidents and stars for everyone
You're amazing
Half of them won't know until you're gone

And in this ritual
You take command and lose control
And in this situation
Find an ocean, sell your soul

Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?

And when it's over
Set aside a moment to forget
It's now or never
Now's the chance to choose what you'll regret

To taking all your time
And leaving me with more than I want
Because I know this time
Absolutely, positively

Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe

Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?

And all the signs of your life
You're making all time alright
And all the lines of your life
You make it fine

And when it's later
Open up your window just in case
You're a radar
Built to scan the deeps of outer space

And if you recognize
Subtle patterns in the sky
Don't take it as a sign
Unless it eases your mind

Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?

// The Weather //

Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the fog wraps itself around you?

Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
Where the clouds take their places for you?

And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you
And as long as it's talking with you
Talk of the weather will do

Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
Where the song repeats itself inside you?

And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you

Nobody's hoping for better days
No one knows what to do
You're okay in your secret ways
No one bothering you

It might save time if I meet you there
But I don't care, I'd rather wait for you

And no one's home and the weather's fine
I'd rather wait for you
Where no one's home and the weather's fine
I'd rather wait for you
