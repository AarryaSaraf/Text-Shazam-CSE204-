Album: TheNormalYears

// Car //

You get the car, I'll get the night off
You'll get the chance to take the world apart
And figure out how it works
Don't let me know what you find out

I need a car, you need a guide, who needs a map?
If I don't die or worse, I'm gonna need a nap
At best I'll be asleep when you get back

I wanna see it when you find out what comets, stars, and moons are all about
I wanna see their faces turn to backs of heads and slowly get smaller
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now

I want specifics on the general idea
I wanna think what I should know
Want you to do me what to show

I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams
I wanna see movies of my dreams

I wanna see it when you get stoned on a cloudy desert breezy afternoon
I wanna see it untame itself and break its owner
I wanna see it now
I wanna see it now

// Some //

Some people think he's good looking
Other people think he's not
Some people don't even know his name
Other people know it by heart

Some people think he likes to go out dancing
Other people not
One guy I know thinks he's hard to get along with

But a lot of people think he's fine
Yeah, yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
And he don't even know
Just sees how each day goes

Some people say she's funny
Other people say she's dumb
Some people say she's stuck-up
Others say she's shy

Some people like her for her charm
Some people take her for granted

Some people wanna steal her heart
Yeah, some people wanna steal her heart
And she don't even know
How could that be so?

// So & So So & So From Wherever Wherever //

You're a fool for everything
I'm a fool for not thinking that things would turn out this way
Like to think that you're immune
To the stuff, it's closer to the truth to say you're full of shit
You're gonna have to face it

So and so, he has a job
Gets up at a certain time, goes to a certain place
Takes a lot of pride in his work
But it's not what he would choose to do
He just does it for the money
And the opportunity

So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever

More or less a waste of flesh
You're so insecure, you probably think this song's about you
Don't be so hard on yourself
There's plenty of flesh to go around
Besides it's not like you are not using it
And who is who to say what flesh should do
And who should have it for that use

So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever
So and so so and so from wherever wherever

Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever
Wherever, wherever, wherever, wherever

// Shortcut //

Kind of upset
But I shouldn't be
When things go smoothly invent problems
In my stupid head
What's wrong with getting by on what gets you by I know it's no big deal
But why do I feel stupid when head my is happy
What happened to
My imagination
How can things be so un-intense?
Can I arrange to be deranged
Can I arrange to have a change
Thought I might be there
Forgot the shortcut there
I know I won't be there
Forgot the shortcut there
Thought I might be there
Thought I was already there but
Forgot the shortcut there
I know I won't be there
I know I've never been there
Forgot the shortcut there

// Some Things Last A Long Time //

Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever
The red is strong
The blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
I think
About you
Often
Often
I can't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time it's funny

But it's true
And it's true
But it's not funny
Time comes and goes
All the while
I still think of you
Some things last a long time
Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever
Times that we shared
All that we forget
Some things last a life time
Some things last a life time

// Girl //

Sitting at the railway station
Reading books about intimidation
Waiting for my girl to come
And if she does will she be dumb
Or really smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Find a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone who'll give me time and give me space
And take it all away

Sitting at the bus station
Reading books about legislation
Suddenly my girl comes
And she's not even dumb
In fact she's kind of smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Send a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone who'll give me time and give me space and take it all away

Actually I've never even been to a railroad station even though I used to live near one
And still I'm waiting for my girl to come
And if she does will she be dumb
Or really smart
Will she break my heart
And wad it up and throw it in my face
Wad it up and throw it in my face
I knew I'd find a nice girl someday
Find a nice girl
Settle down

Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to
Someone I don't have to talk to
Someone I can talk to

// Joyride //

Saturday I jotted down some words I cried
All about a girl that I thought I loved
Told the story of what we did and what went wrong
You've heard it all before its the same old shit

So I won't bore you with all the details
I'm sure that you can listen between the lines
I screwed her and she screwed me, but we never once had sex
All we ever had is too much time

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash

This part of the song is called the second verse
Sounds just like the first verse but with different words
It only has three chords and they are A, E and D
They are A and E and D
Then it goes to B minor, D
A little A, another E, then D again

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash!

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash

Love is just a joyride
Love is just a joyride, love is just a joyride
Just a joyride, joyride
Love is just a joyride

// Sick & Wrong //

Put your hands together
Put your hands together
It's time to get together
It's time to get on the winning side
Get your shit together
Get your shit together
Put your hands together
Or put your hands behind your back

I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong what does that make you?
I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong what does that make you?
We've been telling you and warning you what's right and good, share our perfect opinion:
It's the ideal ideal

Get your shit together
You better get your shit together
Put your hands together
Or put your hands behind your back

I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong what does that make you?
I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong what does that make you?
I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong hat does that make
I don't know where I be-long but
I know I belong
I'm sick and I'm wrong what does that make you?

// Still Flat //

And you tell me this and you tell me that
No matter how the thing grows it's still flat
And you showed me this
And you showed me that
Because of where you came from
You know where its at
Another Marxist celebration
This time with pipes instead of guns
With very little dedication
To anything that isn't fun
It's gonna take some dedication
It's gonna take some dedica...

And you showed me this and you showed me that
Because of where I came from
You know where I'm at
And you tell me this and you tell me that
No matter how round it feels its still flat
Its still flat
Another cosmic demonstration
With stars colliding into suns
It doesn't take imagination
Its just the way this stuff is done
Better than your imagination

// Terrible / Perfect //

Now it seems so terrible, at the time it didn't seem like much
All the months and miles in between us
And it's terrible

Save some place in your mind
I'm getting good at time
Save some space in your mind
I'm getting out of time

Once in awhile there's this girl I don't know in my dreams
She reminds me of a lot of people
But she's someone that I've never seen
And she's perfect

Save a place in your mind
I'm getting good at time
Save some space in your mind
I'm getting out of time
