// Earthquake //

Do you recall
Waking up on
A dirty couch
In the gray fog?
And the gray dog
Barking down the street?

Columns shake your feet
Beneath your feet
Beneath your feet
Beneath your feet

Do you recall?
Your face was white as all
Do you bone the sheets?
Do you think of me?
Your long lost friend from the sea

How long was heat?
How long was he?
How long was he?
How long was he?
How long was heat?
How long was he?

// Don't Cry //

Come on, little boy
I am your friend
And I understand
The pain you're in

You've seen your mom come
Come home dreaming
In the rain, when you wash
You can't fade it

Come on, little boy
You don't need to cry
You don't need to cry your eyes out, cry your eyes out
Come on, kid
Keep your head up and sigh
You don't need to understand
The reasons why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh

// Revival //

I am saved, I'm saved
And, oh, would you believe it?
On the third day
I felt his presence near me

I know they won't believe me, but
I've got favorite memories

I am saved, I'm saved
And, oh, could you believe it?
You won't regret
If you choose to believe it

Freedom, silence, always, yeah
All these darkened hallways

Darkness always
It doesn't make much sense
Darkened hallways
Away from me, calling: "Stay"

// Sailing //

Wind in my sails
I lived for days
No water, no food
It was good

I didn't mind, no
Nowhere to be
Nothing to see
Except me

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get

When there is no law
You've done nothing wrong
You can't take too long
Making up songs

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get
Whatever you can get

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get
Whatever you can get

// Memory Boy //

Did you stick with me?
Let me jog my memory
I see you leaving
Oh, don't forget your TV

It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore

That October
he came over every day
The smell of loose-leaf
joints on jeans and we would play

"It's not a house anymore."
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore

Try to recognize your son
In your eyes he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Is there anyone who
Wants to see the sun go down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

// Desire Lines //

When you were young
And your excitement showed
But as time goes by is it outgrown?

Is that the way things go?
Forever reaching for the gold?
Forever fading black and comes up cold

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

When you were young
You never knew which way you'd go
What was once grace now undertows

Well, every day do what you can
And if you let them turn you 'round
Whatever goes up must come down

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

// Basement Scene //

Dream, a little dream
All about the basement scene
I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up, no

If you've seen the light turn gold
Come out tonight and we'll get stoned
I don't wanna get old, I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna get old, no

Dream, a little dream
About your friends and their endings
Now I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up
I wanna wake up now

It could be the death of me
Knowing that my friends will not remember me
I wanna get old, I wanna get old
I wanna get old

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know

Oh, shit

// Helicopter //

Take my hand and pray with me
My final days in company
The devil now has come for me
And helicopters circling the scene

And I pray for rest
Could you pray for us?
We know he loves you the best
We know he loves you the best

The light's inside my cave
I'm tired of my cave

Oh, these drugs they play
On me in these terrible ways
They don't pay like they used to pay
I used to make it day to day

No one cares for me
I keep no company
I have minimal needs
And now they are through with me

Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me

Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me

// Fountain Stairs //

I forgot my book
At the fountain stairs
At a chapter on symmetry
Nobody cares

And I had a smoke
While I traced the squares
Put my finger to concrete
Felt the autumn air

When I look around
I can feel it spinning
Feet on the ground
Head on the ceiling

Sun on my shirt
Sweat on my hands
All falling in retrograde
Cancel all my plans

And I had to look
At the marching band
Skip across the pavement
Nobody's there

When I look around
I can feel it spinning
Feet on the ground
Head on the ceiling

// Coronado //

I was sick, I was dead
Lay my head on the cement bed, I had a
A few good years
But they don't know

Come on now, don't leave me hanging
Cuz I wanna get down or I
I'll start believing
What they said

In my heart I don't believe it
And if I go ahead I know that you're leaving and I
I can't wait to see you go
I can't wait to see you go

In my heart I feel so high
I wanna know the answers why
I ask so many questions, they let me go
They hang up the telephone

And if I die before I wake
I know that it must frustrate
Some people that need a paycheck
Well, they need their blood let

// He Would Have Laughed //

Only bored as I get older
Find the ways to cult, cult of time
Only bored as I get older
Find new ways to spend my time

I'm a gold digging man
Find my money, find my land
I'm a gold, gold digging man
I won't rest 'til I buy your land

Sweetness comes suffering
In sweetness comes suffering
I won't rest till I can't breathe
I can't breathe with you looking at me

I get bored as I get older
Can you help me figure this out?

Come on, dream on

"I lived on a table
I don't know where to go
I know my friends would
I know where my friends are now

I lived on a farm, yeah
I never lived on a farm
Where did my friends go?
Where did my friends go?"

What do you do when you're sleeping?
Where did you go when you said:
"I don't need nobody on my bond"
"I don't need nobody on my bond"

Where do your friends go?
Where do they see you?
What did you want to be?
Ah, shut the hell, shut your mouth
