// Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing //

Ooooh baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Oh honey
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

Ooooo, I read your letters you're not here
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Don't you know
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game, a fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

Oh, I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there

So glad we got the real thing baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh honey
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
No darling
Ain't nothing like the real thing 
Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

// You're All I Need To Get By //

You're all I need to get by

Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
With arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door

Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need to get by
You're all, all I need, oh baby
You're all I want...

// Keep On Lovin' Me Honey //

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true
[T:] Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do
[M:] Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere
[T:] Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
[M:] And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause like a leaf out on a tree
[M:] You've become a part of me
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[Both:] Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
[M:] Oh Tammi
[T:] What good am I without you
[M:] I can't do without you, darlin'
[Both:] Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
[T:] Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
[M:] No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man
[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
[...and fade]
