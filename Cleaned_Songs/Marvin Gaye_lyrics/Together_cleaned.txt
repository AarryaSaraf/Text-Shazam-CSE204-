Album: Together

// Once Upon A Time //

Once upon a time I almost lost my mind
I was lonely, so lonely
Once upon a time

Hoping every day things would go my way
Then you came into my life
Now everything is fine

I never knew what love could do till I met you
Now everything is oh so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you
I'm so glad; I was lonely
Once upon a time

// Deed I Do //

[MG:] Do I want you? Do I want you?
Oh my, baby do I?
Yeah yeah yeah baby, you can bet your life I do

[MW:] Do I need you? Do I need you?
Oh my, yeah baby do I?
Hey baby, you can bet your life I do

[MG:] I wanna tell you one thing right here
I'm so glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin', hangin', hangin' 'round you
[MW:] Oh do I love you? Do I love you?
Oh my, yeah do I?
Hey baby, you can bet your life I do

[MW:] I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin' around you

// Until I Met You (Corner Pocket) //

[MW:] I used to be so fancy free
But really lonesome as could be
Till one lucky day you came my way, Marvin
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MG:] I used to think there'd never be
A girl who'd ever care for me
But what do you know? You made it so
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MW:] When you kissed me I felt the seasons change
From winter to spring
[MG:] Ooo when you kissed me, I lost my reason
'Cause I heard the birds sing; I felt like a king
[MW:] Now I have to rub my eyes
Each time I try to realize
That your love is mine, ain't it just fine?
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you

[MG:] I used to be fancy free
Really lonesome as can be
Till one lucky day you came my way
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you, baby yeah

[MW:] I used to think there'd never be
A boy who'd ever care for me
But what do you know? You made it so
I never knew what love was all about, baby
Until I met you

[MG:] When you kissed me I felt the seasons change
From winter to spring, yeah
[MW:] When you kissed me, I lost my reason
'Cause I heard the birds sing; I felt like a queen
[MG:] Now I've got to rub my eyes
Each time I try to realize
That your love is mine, ain't it just fine?
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you, yeah

[MG:] I never knew, baby, no no
[MW:] I never knew, Marvin, what love was, yeah
[MG:] I'm crying out, baby, yeah yeah
[MW:] We're gonna take it slow, let it go right now, yeah

// Together //

(Together, together)
[MG:] We'd stroll the lane together
[MW:] Laugh at the rain, oh you know, together
[BOTH:] Sang love's refrain together
& we'd both pretend it would never end

[MW:] When we cried, you know we cried together
[MG:] Cast love aside together
[BOTH:] You're gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always be together

(Together, together)
[BOTH:] & we'd both pretend it would never end

[MW:] You stole the sunshine, oh you know
We're gonna be together
[MG:] & our hearts, our hearts that won together

But in my memory
We'll always ([Backing:] always be)
We'll always ([Backing:] always be)
We'll always be ([Backing:] always be) together

// For Sentimental Reasons (I Love You) //

I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

Whenever you're in sight

Je t'aime toi
Pour raisons sentimentales
J'espere que tu me crois
Je t'ai donne mon coeur

I love you
For sentimental reasons

[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss! 
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] All night long

[MW:] Gee it's cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up & hold me tight
Stars above, they seem to know
We're putting on a late late show
[MG:] Hear the pretty music in the trees
See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

[MW (with MG echoing):] Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
[MW:] We kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss! 
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!
[MW:] Kiss! 
[MG:] All night long

[MW:] Then we amble back to my front door
Say good night & then we kiss some more
[MG:] Did you know I like it so?
It started at the late late show

[MW:] When you cuddle up & hold me so tight
Stars above, they seem to know, yeah
We're putting on a late late show

[MG:] See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

[MW (with MG echoing):] Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
[MW:] We kiss! 
[MG:] Kiss!

// After The Lights Go Down Low //

[MG:] After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
[MW:] & when the dancin' is through & folks will be through
I'll be sitting with no one but you
[BOTH:] & I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low

[MG:] I wanna hold you & squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you & please you & make you understand
[MW:] & when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a real good time
[MG:] After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
[MW:] & when we cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I got somethin' sweet I want you to hear
[BOTH:] & I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low

[BOTH:] After the lights go down low

[MG:] I wanna hold you & squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you & please you & make you understand

// Just Squeeze Me (But Don't Tease Me) //

[MG:] Treat me sweet & gentle when you say good night
Squeeze me; please don't tease me
[MW:] I get sentimental whenever you hold me tight
So squeeze me, but please don't tease me

[Bridge:]
[MG:] Missin' you since you went away
Singin' the blues each day
Countin' the nights waitin' for you
[MW:] I want you to know
I never knew I'd love you so
Please say you love me too
[MG:] When I get this feelin', I'm in ecstasy
Squeeze me, please don't tease me

[MG:] Squeeze me, don't tease me

[MW:] Mmm squeeze me, baby don't you tease me

// What's The Matter With You Baby //

[Both:] Wo wo wo...

[Him:] What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
What did I do wrong?
[Her:] Do you really wanna know?
[Him:] I wanna know, what's the matter with you, baby?
[Her:] You know that you done me wrong
[Him:] Sorry, didn't mean no harm
Oh baby, let me take you out tonight
Make every little thing all right

[Her:] You know you told me there would never be another
And you know you lied
When you lied, you hurt me, baby
[Him:] When I left and I went away
I didn't know how much I loved you until today
[Her:] Oh baby, leavin' me wasn't right
And now you wanna take me out tonight

[Him:] Mary, won't you let me get on your good side?
[Her:] If I did that, Marvin, it would hurt my pride
[Him:] Hey, let me make it up to you if I can
[Her:] I can't do it, don't you understand?

[Him:] What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
[Her:] I told you that you done me wrong
[Him:] Well, can you forgive me, Mary, please forgive me?
[Her:] I'll try, but it'll take some time
[Him:] Hurry up, hurry up, before I lose my mind
[Her:] I've got a feelin' everything is gonna work all right
But you can't take me out tonight

[Both:] Wo wo wo... [and fade]

// You Came A Long Way From St. Louis //

You came a long way from St. Louis,
you climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars
that were parked out in front of your fancy address.

You came a long way from St. Louis,
you broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals
who were doing alright till you came on the scene.

You came here from the middle west,
and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.
Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So natcherly I got my doubts, you got `em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.

You came a long way from St. Louis,
but baby, you still got a long way to go.
