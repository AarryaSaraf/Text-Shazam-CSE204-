// Your Heart Belongs To Me //

Lover of mine
Gone to a faraway land
Serving your country
On some faraway sand
But you should get no name
Remember that your heart belongs to me

I'm sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So when you're feeling lonely
It's something to remind you 
I'm thinking of you constantly
Remember that your hearts belongs to me
Your heart belongs to me

If a pretty girl should pass you by
I won't mind
If you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart
Because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Your heart is mine

Lover of mine
If I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come
When you will return
From far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me
Remember your heart belongs to me
Far across the sea

// Who's Lovin' You //

When I had you here
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And since
Oh, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder
Who is loving you

Life without love
Don't you know it's oh so lonely
I don't think
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Well my life
All my love I devote to you only
Come on and take it
Come on and take it

Because all
All I can do
All I can do since you've been gone is cry
And since, boy, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder, who is loving you
Wonder who is loving you

// Baby Don't Go //

You said you loved me
We'd never part
Now you're breaking
Yes you are breaking my heart
Baby don't go, don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby

You found another love
But it can't be true
Because you love me
And I'll always love you
Baby don't go, don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby

True love is hard to find
But you'll never never never find a love like mine
Darling, yes, my darling
Yes, stay stay by my side
Baby don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby
Stay and tell me I'm still your baby
I wanna be, I wanna be your baby Come on...

// Buttered Popcorn //

My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

He took me to a show
He said he wanted some more
I said kiss me please
He said after I eat

I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats buttered popcorn
Well it worries me so 
I don't know what to do
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats buttered popcorn
Well it worries me so 
I don't know what to do
When I asked him 
What was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

// I Want A Guy //

I want a guy to love me
One who will love me completely
Not like the last
Who's in the past
Who broke my heart and made me cry

I wish that he would come and kiss me
And tell me that he misses me
I know someday
He'll come my way
And I'll never be lonely again

I don't need riches like diamond rings
As long as he loves me
That's everything
As long as he holds me tight
As long as he treats me right
I'll never let him out of my sight

I want a guy with a love that's true
One that I can tell my troubles to
He'll be my guy
And stay by my side
I'd be so glad if I only had
A guy, a guy
Why can't I have a guy
A guy

// Let Me Go The Right Way //

// You Bring Back Memories //

I thought that I had forgotten you
That you were just something of my yesterdays
But now that I see you standing here
All that I can say

Is let me tell you that
You bring back memories
Of all the days gone by
Apologies all of the times you lied
I recall when I used to be your girl
You used to be my guy
I thought that I had forgotten all these days
Think about these days

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories

Just a look at you
You don't know what you make me want to do
I want to take you in my arms and then kiss you once again 
And then I'd like to ask you
Where have you been
I never thought that I would think about
These things

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories

Let me tell you
Let me tell you
Let me tell you I thought that I had forgotten of things
About how you looked at me
Just a look at you brings back the memories

You bring back memories
About the love we knew
D'ya think I was still in love with you
But that ain't true
I love you just like I used to do
I thought that I had forgotten all of these things

But let me tell you
You don't know how many memories
That you bring
Bringing back memories
Sweet, sweet, sweet memories
Memories
Sweet, sweet, sweet memories
Bringing back memories

// Time Changes Things //

Funny how time changes
Rearranges everything

For instance how could I have known
That you'd be the only one for me
When you wanted me I didn't want you

And time changes things its true
'Cause now I want you
I want you

When you used to speak to me
I didn't give you a second look
'Cause I already had many guys
In my telephone book
But one day my heart spoke your name
My heart spoke your name

And time changes things its true
'Cause now I want you
I want you

Funny how times turns the tables
And left me yearning, my heart burning
For instance you just past me by passed me by
You didn't speak and I wanted to die
Now that I want you
You don't want me

And time changes things, it's true
You know I need you
And time changes things, it's true
I keep repeating, now
And time changes things, it's true
'Cause now I want you

It's so funny
Funny how time changes
Funny how time rearranges
It's so funny
It's so funny how I want you

// Play A Sad Song //

Play a sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
With a broken heart

Play a sad song
Let him know that I'm still crying
Let him know I'm slowly dieing, slowly dieing, slowly dieing
So play a sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
With a broken heart

I don't know why he left
We were doing so fine
He was mine, all mine
He must have found another love
He must have found another love
And put me down
So play a sad, sad, sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart

I gave him all the love
All the loving I had
Now he's driving me mad
He knows I've never been a cheat
I tried to make my kisses sweet
He said I made his life complete
Now he's gone
So play a sad, sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart
So play a sad, sad song
For a girl with a broken heart

// Never Again //

You told me that you love me
You said we'd never part
You took all my love
Then you broke my heart

Never again
Never again will I fall in love

I did everything you wanted me to
'Cause I thought your love was true
But I was blind
And I couldn't see
Why did you do this to me

But I still love you
And I always will
I still thrill to your kiss
But I'll never come back to you
Lying over this

Never again
Will I fall in love
Never again
Never again

I don't care because I'm just sixteen
And my guy is seventeen
He's only seventeen

And we're as happy as two can be
We have pledged our love eternally

Don't you know, know, know
