// Inflation //

Up against the wall, turkey
What? Up against the wall?

A dollar bill can buy you a meal
But the meal just ain't worth havin'
A dollar bill can't buy you a meal
'Cause a dollar bill just ain't no deal

Almighty dollar
Never seem to make it (Almighty dollar)
Almighty dollar, oh yeah
Government make us take it (Almighty dollar)

I sacrifice to feed my wife
What can I do? Lord, what can I do?
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, yeah

Inflation
Sweeping 'cross the nation
Inflation'
(Can't get enough food to eat, yeah)
I ain't got no shoes on my feet
(What?)
Inflation
(Even make a preacher steal, yeah)
Got my woman on the pill, hey
Inflation
(Taxes going up so high, well)
I can't afford to die

What you say?
You know what man, I said: "Two dollars for a pack of cigarettes, what?""
I said, "Man, you must be crazy, do they do dishes?"

Almighty dollar
Never seem to make it (Almighty dollar)
Almighty dollar, oh yeah
Government make us take it (Almighty dollar)

I sacrifice to feed my wife
What can I do? Lord, what can I do?
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, yeah

Inflation
It's got the whole congregation
Inflation'
(Can't get enough food to eat, yeah)
I ain't got no shoes on my feet
Inflation
(It'll even make a preacher steal, ha ha)
Got my woman on the pill, hey
Inflation
(Taxes going up so high)
I think I'm gonna die

What? Two dollars?
Lemme have one. Come on, hook me up
A dollar? Can't get a gallon of gas for a dollar

Everything going up
Going up
Going up, going up
Sing it

// We All Know Who We Are //

You're a diamond in the sky
All the bad things pass you by
When such a feeling come to you (come to you yeah)
Cast no shadow on the truth

Sometimes it seems so heavy
For us to understand yeah
But the spirit has been with us, yeah
Since the start of time

The answer to our problems
Enjoy the spice of life, yeah yeah
Things ain't right always, hey
Out of sight out of mind

Say, I don't know where I'm going, yeah hey
But I know I'll soon be there, yeah
And where ever it is I'm going
I know the answer will be waiting there, yeah ow yeah

We all know who we are (hey

Who we are (hey hey hey heyhey yeahyeah)
We all know who we are (alright)

You know and I know

And the crisis that we live in
We need a light to shine
And the light will surely take us
If you see that its, that its a sign

Ooh we always know who we are
Who we are

// It's Over //

The dark of midnight, girl, is this
A sigh, a cry, a hit, a miss
I wonder can you get to this
Our problems can't be solved with a kiss

40 days 40 nights
Well, I tried to make things be just right
I thought I'd stand in nature's way, all right
But it didn't work out so I'm here to say

It's over, it's over
It didn't last very long
It's over, it's over
It seem to all turn out wrong

I knew somehow the day would come (yes, sir)
Those clouds of grey would take away our sun (take away our sun)
We look for love each and every day (look for love)
Despite it all I'm still here alone today

Well

It's over, it's over
It didn't last very long
It's over, it's over
It seem to all turn out wrong

It's over, it's over
It's over, over, over
Over, over
Over, over
