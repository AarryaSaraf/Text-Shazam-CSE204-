// This Life Is Not For Me //

This life is not for me
No
No
As far as I can see
No
No
This job is all I see
Oh
No
There must be more for me
(Yeah)

Boogie with my baby is what I need to do
But I'm stuck in this place with a jive interview
I need to party to circulate my blood
With Bobby, Kim and Sue and the rest of the crew
Don't tell me your problems, I've got some for myself
'Cause who's gonna love you if you don't love yourself
That foot-stomping rhythm will take care of my ails
'Cause there's much more to life than paying bills

This life is not for free
No
No
You'll turn into a freak
Oh
No
This ain't the place to be
No
No
As far as I can see
(Yeah)

Taking care of business is the only thing we know
'Cause no matter what the weather we say 'On with the show'
It ain't no secret to the magic that we make
When we look in the crowd and see the smiles on their face
The atmosphere's electric, 'cause we really take charge
When we come on right after Bobby DeBarge
That foot-stomping rhythm will take care of my ails
'Cause there's much more to life than paying bills

This life is not for me
No
No
As far as I can see
No
No
This job is all I see
Oh
No
There must be more for me
(Yeah)

This life is not for free
No
No
You'll turn into a freak
Oh
No
This ain't the place to be
No
No
As far as I can see
(Yeah)

// Can't Help Falling In Love //

Do you know girl?
As we live life we learn many many different things about ourselves
And there's one thing I've learned for sure
As our love has grown from day to day, year to year
I just can't help the way I feel about you
And with each second that passes by
I realize that, that is something tha could never change
Wise man say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Share a nice day, would it be the same?
But I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, don't you know
That some things, some things were meant to me
Darling take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

// Style //

Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down
Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down

Gotta get a message straight across to you
Put a little a class in everything you do
The way you walk, talk, and the way you dress
Gonna put a little distance between you and the rest
Well it's that style (Style)
That makes you stand out from the crowd
(Style)
Get your point across without ever talking loud
If respect's what you want, then that's what you get
(Style, whoo)
You can work a sweat without ever getting wet
Ho

If you think that you're undesired
Then you'll soon see
Personality is the way to get by it
You will work it out
(Work it out)
(Now's the time for)
Time to get
(Serious)
Keep it all together
'Cause with style comes class

Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down
Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down

Gotta be a hero, change some point of views
Gotta set a trend and just make it be the news
Use your charm, your wit, your personality
To cure the cats' curiosity
Well it's that style that you read about in all the magazines
All that looks good might not be what it seems
Some think you learn it from the books
Either you have it or you don't
You'll get it or you won't

Use it, then lose it, they won't reintroduce it
What you need is your panache to earn the rank of class
Now's the time for
(Time to get)
Serious (Serious)
Keep it all together
'Cause with style comes class

Scratch
Style
