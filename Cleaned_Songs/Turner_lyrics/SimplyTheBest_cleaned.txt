// I Can't Stand The Rain //

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because he's not here with me

Hey, window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain, can't stand the rain

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
It just keeps on holding me
Get off of my window
Because here's not here with me
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories

// Private Dancer //

Well, the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names
You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
Keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

I wanna make a million dollars
I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family
All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
Just a private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

Deutsche Marks or dollars
American Express will do nicely, thank you
Let me loosen up your collar
Tell me, do you wanna see me do the shimmy again?

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
Do what you want me to do
Just a private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names
You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
Keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
Just a private dancer, a dancer for money

// Let's Stay Together //

Let me say
Since, since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
It's alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my whole life with you
Let me say
Since, since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

(Good or bad, happy or sad)

Why, oh, tell me, why do people break up
And turn around and make up?
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
Being around you is all I see

So, baby, let's we all stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

(Let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether
Whether (times are good or bad, happy or sad)
Oh, baby, let's
Let's
Loving you whether
Whether (times are good or bad, happy or sad)

// Better Be Good To Me //

A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell (captured)
Oh, yes, I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion?
Should I?
Should I?

Oh, you better be good to me!
That's how it's got to be now
'Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good, good
C'mon, c'mon, be good to me

I think it's all so right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
Yes, I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith?
Oh, sure, babe, anything to please you!

But you better be good to me
That's how it's got to be now
'Cause I don't have the time for your overloaded lines
And you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Be good to me

And I really don't see why it's so hard to be
Good to me, and, you know
I don't understand, what's your plan
That you can't be good to me
What I can't feel I surely cannot see
Why can't you be good to me
And if it's not real, I do not wish to see
Why don't you be good to me

Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?

Be good, good to me
Be good to me
'Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
So you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Better be good to me

Better be good
'Cause I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
And I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
(Why can't you be) be good to me
(Why can't you be) be good
(Why can't you be) be good to me
(Why can't you be)

'Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
You better be good to me
(Why can't you be) good to me
(Why can't you be) good to me
Be good

Be good to me
Why can't you be (Why can't you be) good to me (Be good to me)
Why can't you be (Why can't you be) good to me (Be good to me)
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Be good to me

// Typical Male //

Tell me lawyer what to do
I think I'm falling in love with you
Defend me from the way I feel
Won't you give me some advice
On how to handle my private life
I'm sure that we can make a deal
I confess I'm a fool for men
With a clever mind
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

Your sense of justice I'll embrace
But your defense don't help my case
I'm deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer got to catch me when I fall
Oh they say that you match your wits
With the best of them
But I know when I'm close you're just
Like the rest of them

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
And open up your heart and let me in
Now open up your heart and let me in

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

The reaction
I'm just using my feminine charm
On a typical male, on a typical

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

A little reaction
I'm just using my female attraction

// Steamy Windows //

I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my baby was just getting right
All systems on overload
Radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
And we were snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine with a man all night
With good intent
But there is something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer
And start things happen again
Yeah, yeah

Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Zero visibility, yeah
Steamy windows

// The Best //

I call you when I need you
When my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me
Wild and wired

When you come to me
Give me everything I need

Give me a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
Speak the language of love
Like you know what it means

And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start
Of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost
I get washed away

Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, no, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go!

You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

You're the best

You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, baby
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

You're the best
You're better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met

Oh, you're the best

// Be Tender With Me Baby //

You got the right to tell me
It's all over
It isn't like me to be
Begging you
Don't let go don't let go
Just stay with me another day
When I'm not myself
Please understand me
I'm so confused I don't know what to do
But don't give up
Don't give up
It just may take a little time

Be tender with me baby
I'm so afraid you'll go away
Be tender with me baby always

I know that you've been patient
With my weakness
And that you hate to see me cry
But I know yes I know
It doesn't have to be this way
But I'm so lonely I could die

Be tender with me baby
I'm so afraid you'll go away
Be tender with me baby always

Why does my heart keep on longing
Why do I feel like I do
I hope you see this is not really me
This is just a phase that I'm going through

Be tender with me baby
Be tender with me baby
I'm so afraid you'll go away
Be tender with me baby
For always always
Be tender with me baby
I'm so afraid you'll go away
Be tender with me baby
Always for always always

// I Don't Wanna Lose You //

Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and your job is responses
Having played the mating game
She doesn't waste time 'cause
All that she wants is
Real and honest devotion
Want here can't help her show
Though I hardly know your name
I know about love and I know

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love

Women who have made mistakes are a little afraid
They don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed by those madly amasses
I know I've only just met you
Baby, I should know better
But when you look at me that way
There's something inside that's so right

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love

Tell me you're real
You're not pretending
Let's make a deal
'Cause my heart's depending on you
Oh, baby

I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way, oh, yeah
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
I don't even wanna say goodbye, oh, no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love, true love
I don't wanna lose you
And I always want to feel this way
'Cause every time I'm with you I feel
True love, true love, true love

// We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) //

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The thunderdome

Looking for something
We can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The thunderdome

// River Deep - Mountain High //

When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day

And do I love you my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down
'Cause it grows stronger, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows

And do I love you my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet
And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Oh yeah you've gotta believe me
River deep, mountain high
Do I love you my oh my, oh baby
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

// It Takes Two //

One can have a dream baby
Two can make the dream so real
One can talk about living love
Two can see how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make the light shine through

It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
That's a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar
Like an island here all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like being at home

It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can go out to the movies
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that scene in the movies
Something really kinda neat
And one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that's it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand
Is like adding just a pinch of spice

It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby it takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

// Addicted To Love //

The lights are on but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your body sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't eat you can't sleep
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Oh you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love

You see the signs but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats at double time
Another kiss and you'll be mind one track mind
You can't be saved another young love is all you crave
And if the sun left you you don't mind it feels blue

Oh you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love
Gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

// I Want You Near Me //

Should you stay should you go
Hmm you're beginning to see
I blow hot I blow cold
Oh it's just the devil in me
You got to understand I am
In love with a beautiful man
So if you're feeling insecure
You've really got no cause to be

I want you near me
Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down

You're so good with your hands
To help me with a hook or zip
Indispensable that's what you are
Hmm for the occasional kiss
I'm only playing games with you
I can't be nice without being cruel
I know it's unfair but I make the rules

I want you near me
Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down

All I want I've decided
Is your attention
Undivided

Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down

// Way Of The World //

Baby I need a hand to hold tonight
And one bright star to remind me
How dear is this life
Baby I've never known anyone like you
There's something very special about you
I can't imagine living without you

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart
In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing I can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And I'll never regret loving you

Baby I will go anywhere you lead
As long as you're there beside me
Baby that's all I need
Hold me hold me and never let me go
I'm always gonna care about you
I never want to be without you

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart
In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing I can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And I'll never regret loving you

You're everything I believe in
Don't ever lose the feeling
Don't ever lose the feeling no

It's the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
