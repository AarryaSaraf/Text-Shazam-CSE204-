// Fruits Of The Night //

Dangles of dust itching for the last
Goes around, dum, dum
Shadows go out, streets come alive
Shake some phone for relight it on

And I check in someone I thought
Someone the same I give you hand
Then I'll be waiting, showing no game
But here's no prey, should be

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow when it's not
I got my fruits of the night
Oh, that's get so dumb
So romantic

Wicked princess wanna the best
All dressed down to get up the prince
And I'm becoming smile, running wild
Hey, don't you know
You got caught it, yeah, yeah

And I'll beware you wanna that
And she wanna sale, I give you hand
And I check in showing no game
Where ain't flame there's just stop here

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow when it's not
I got my fruits of the night
Oh, that's get so dumb
So romantic

Ooh, what you need that special key
You're so weird down on your knees
Going for this, dying for that
But that's just normal cigarette

Fruits of the night
Got hard it slow but it's not
Fruits of the night
Just a photo
So romantic

Fruits of the night
I got my fruits of the night, yeah
Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night, yeah

Do, do, do, yeah

Fruits of the night
I got my fruits of the night, yeah
Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night, yeah

Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do do do do do, wow
Yeah
Do, do do do do, do do do, do
Do, do do do do, do do do, do

Fruits of the night
Got my fruits of the night

// The Bitch Is Back //

I was justified when I was five
Raising cane, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back
Eat meat on Friday that's alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high from the speaking about the things I do

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
I'm a bitch and I'm back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my god, what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
I'm a bitch and I'm back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
I'm a bitch and I'm back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do

// The Woman I'm Supposed To Be //

Won't you give me just one day
Without a worry
I could use that extra hours
I'm in a hurry

I can tell you how it feels to be holdin' on to
The woman I'm supposed to be

Won't you give me just one hour
To display my kindness
I'm so sure I got the [?]
To kill you blindness

I can tell you how it feels to be holdin' on to
The woman I'm supposed to be

And when you paws
Only thing that helps is a little understanding
I'm praying for a happy ending

Won't you give me just one day
Without a worry
I could use that extra hours
'Cause I'm in a hurry

I can show you how it feels to be holdin' on to
The woman I'm supposed to be

I can show you how it feels to be holdin' on
Holdin' on
Holdin' on to
The woman I'm supposed to be

Holdin' on
Holdin' on
Holdin' on to
The woman that I'm supposed to be

// Viva La Money //

Nothing make 'em holla
Like the Almighty Dolla
Jungle hogs are ready, again
If you rich and treat her nice
They get a good price
Over charge the poor
Some more

I'm talking 'bout
Viva la money

Now you buy a cheap thrill
And you can pay a few bills
Even get yourself killed, fact
Now it can fool ya heart
And make 'em think your smart
Tear a friend apart
Too bad, too bad

Viva la money

It can make you feel good
But it you feel bad
It can make you happy
But it can make you sad
It can you do right
But it can make you do wrong
And it'll still be around
When you dead and gone

Viva la money

// Funny How Time Slips Away //

Well hello there
My, it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long since I've seen you

It seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I guess she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you would love her 'til the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me

It seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I got to go now
But I guess I'll see you somewhere around
I don't know when though, oh
Because I never know when I'll be back in town
Please remember what I told you
Well I just want to say

That it's so funny
How time slips away
That it's so funny
How time slips away

Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away

// Earthquake & Hurricane //

Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane

The earth cracked open
And was breathing fire
Everybody running
Some was ready to die
Some was going crazy
Some insane
Saying save me
From this hurricane

Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane

People started scrambling
They were on the run
They were hit
With an atom bomb
Some lay crippled
Some lay lane
But they saved me
From this hurricane

Hurricane, hurricane
Hurricane, hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane
Mighty earthquake and a hurricane

// Root, Toot Undisputable Rock 'n Roller //

When you walk into the bar
I'm the first one you're gonna see
Business and pleasure just don't mix
So can I take your order please
You fellas know I don't take no mess
It's a whole lotta woman in this dress

They call me the
Root, toot undisputable Rock and Roller
I gotta fine fanny but a rough talking Annie
Rock and Roller

Every time the jukebox plays
I get out on the floor
Trouble maker come my way
And I'll gladly show him the door
Everybody knows to keep it cool
Cause I'm fresh out of karate school

They call me the
Root, toot undisputable Rock and Roller
I gotta fine fanny but a rough talking Annie
Rock and Roller

Ahhh the root, toot undisputable...

// Fire Down Below //

Here comes old Johnny and he's looking mighty fine
Here comes old Tommy and he's stepping right on time
There go the street lights bringing on the night
Here come the women's faces shining from the light
All through the shadows they come and they go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man trying to make his money green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never going to stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

It happens out in Vegas, it happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
It went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treating somebody right
And he's looking out for Johnny and he's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Amy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch them come and watch them go

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

We've got only one thing in common
We've got the fire down below

Burning
Keep on burning
Hot!

// Sometimes When We Touch //

You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another singer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I see how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by

At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides

// A Woman In A Man's World //

He's always right, I'm always wrong
Because he's weak I must be strong

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world

I say it's white, he says it's black
When he runs away I take him back

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
To love a man in a man's world

But if I use my head
Instead of my heart
I'll find someone is to kill for [?]
Because there's just no use
In trying to be smart
Because I know I'd only learn
To love him more

The more I give, the more he takes
I live inside the world he makes

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world

// Night Time Is The Right Time //

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Well I used all my dollar
Dollar and dime away [?]
Left me alone, a child

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

So squeeze me
So squeeze me
So squeeze me
Lead me, oh baby
Take my hand
Hug me, no other way [?]

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
