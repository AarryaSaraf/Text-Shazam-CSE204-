// Sinner //

[Tipton/Halford]

Sinner rider, rides in with the storm
The devil rides beside him
The devil is his god, God help you mourn
Do you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder
Deafen every living thing about
Can you, can you see it, can you
See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising, time is running out

Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!

His steed of fury
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the carcasses of war
But if it's hungry then it's very presence
Disrupts the calm into the storm

Curse and damn you all you'll fall by the hand of the
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!

God of the Devils, God of the Devils
Won't you help them pray
God of the Devils, God of the Devils
Is there no other way

Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight
Can't you see their blood is boiling setting them alight

[SOLO (Glenn/K.K.)]

Thirty years now sleeping, so sound
War raises its head, and looks slowly around
The Sinner is near, sensing the fear
And the beast will start moving around

Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain
Can't you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight

[SOLO (Glenn/both)]

...Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!
Sinner!

Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Curse and damn you all you fall by the hand of the
Sinner!

// Diamonds And Rust //

I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call

And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust

Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there

Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague

Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust

Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds, Diamonds and Rust

// Starbreaker //

[Tipton/Halford]

Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never seen again

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Paradise is waiting
For the chosen few
Let's hope maybe this time
He picks me and you
Star voyage to a new world
Light-year miles away
Cross your fingers, here he is
Take us now this day

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Starbreaker, take my hand
Starbreaker, understand
Starbreaker, you're the one
Starbreaker, lead us on, and on

[SOLO (K.K./Glenn/both)]

Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never ever seen again

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

// Last Rose Of Summer //

[Halford / Tipton]

Throughout the soft and timeless days of August
'Til now the shadows begin to grow much longer
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
I give you this, the last rose of summer

A token of my unyielding love
So when the winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living

Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
'Til one day not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return

A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
And all around seems dead and cold
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living

The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
In your long shadows
The last rose of summer
In the sunset
The last rose of summer
Take this rose that I give you
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
Don't worry about the winter
The last rose of summer
I shall return
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer

// Let Us Prey / Call For The Priest //

Call for the priest
I'm dying...

Well, the pressure's too much, you know I peaked last night
I gotta get some a quick release
City is standing on my shoulders
My body's going piece by piece
Yeah!

Well I know what I want and I know where to get it
And I'm going there right away
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on
Down to my knees and pray
No!

When your back's to the wall come along one and all
We shall fight all the slander that's penned
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose
For our triumph's the means to their end

With you by my side I shall ride every storm

Let the cynics drop dead in their critical head
They're wrist merchants as we all can see
Bunch of deaf ears with their columnized fears
What a shame, what a shame, oh dear me!

When your back's to the wall, come along one and all
We shall fight all the slander that's penned
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose
For our triumph's the means to their end

Yes I know what I want and I know where to get it
And I'm going there right away
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on
Down to my knees and pray

// Raw Deal //

I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
The steel and leather guys were fooling with the denim dudes
A couple cops playing rough stuff, New York, Fire Island

I cased the joint, straining at the seams

I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled "Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact

Then the big boys, saw me and knew that

I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours

Sex like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures, not colors
The true free expression I demand is human rights - right

I gave my life, I am immortal

Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws

Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming, raw
Deal

// Here Come The Tears //

[Halford/Tipton]

Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by, I'm still alone today
Here come the tears

Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears

All alone, no one cares.
So much to give to you all out there.

Take me now, in your arms.
Let me rest, safe from harm.

Ohhh.... I want to be loved...
I need to be loved...
Won't somebody love me....

[solo]

Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...

Here they come, here come the tears...
Here they come, here come the tears...

[repeat two more times in background]

Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears...
Here come the tears, ohhh
Here come the tears, ohhh
Here come the tears

// Dissident Aggressor //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

// Race With The Devil //

You'd better run
You'd better run
You'd better run from the Devil's gun

The race is on
The race is on
Now you'd better run from the Devil's gun

Strange things happen
If you stay
The Devil will catch you anyway
He'll seek you here
He'll seek you there
The Devil will seek you everywhere

And when he finds you
You'll soon find out
The Devil's fire just won't go out
He burns you up
From head to toe
The Devil's grip just won't let go
