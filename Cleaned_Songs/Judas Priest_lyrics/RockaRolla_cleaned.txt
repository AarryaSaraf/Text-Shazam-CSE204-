// One For The Road //

[Downing/Halford]

Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more

One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way

Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way

// Rocka Rolla //

[Tipton/Downing/Halford]

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys

She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine

Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can

She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law

Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for

Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine

Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can

// Winter //

[Downing/Hill/Atkins]

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head

In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind

I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

// Winter Retreat //

[Downing/Halford]

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

// Cheater //

[Downing/Halford]

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep

She was a cheater

I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you

You are a cheater

They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through

You are a cheater

If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

// Never Satisfied //

[Downing/Halford]

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change

Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER

We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

// Run Of The Mill //

[Downing/Halford/Tipton]

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer

I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride

Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall

I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on

I, I, I, I...

// Dying To Meet You //

[Downing/Halford]

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face

Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led

Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,

But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.
