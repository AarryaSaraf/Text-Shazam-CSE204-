// Fortune Presents Gifts Not According To The Book //

Fortune presents gifts
Not according to the book
Fortune presents gifts
Not according to the book

When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

What various paths are followed
In distributing honours and possessions
She gives awards to some
And penitent's cloaks to others

When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd
Of his cottage and goat pen
And to whomever she fancies
The lamest goat has born two kids

When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

Because in a village a poor lad
Has stolen one egg
He swings in the sun
And another gets away with a thousand crimes

When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

// Black Sun //

Murderer!
Man of fire
Murderer!
I've seen the eyes of living dead
It's the same game, survival
The great mass play
A waiting game
Embalmed, crippled
Dying in fear of pain
All sense of freedom gone

Black sun in a white world
Like having a black sun in a white world

I have a son
His name is Eden
It's his birthright
Beyond estranged times

Give me sixty nine years
Another season in this hell
It's all sex and death
As far as eyes can tell
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock
Of a brave new world
Our god forsaken lot

And I feel
That's all we have ever needed to know
Till worlds end and the seas run cold

Give me sixty nine years
Another season in this hell
There is sex and death
In mother nature's plans
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock
Of a brave new world
Our god forsaken lot
