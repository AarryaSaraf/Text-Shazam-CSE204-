// Joy And Blues //

Joy and blues...

Here we are in this ocean
Between life and death and truth and lie
Between rich and poor and sick and cure
Between joy and blues (joy and blues)

Here we are in this ocean
Between light a day and dark a night
Between nature and destruction
Between joy and blues (joy and blues)

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if it's money you put down
It's only money you could lose
Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
'Cause when your life is on the line
It's only life you can lose
Alright

We have the potion
To clear all evil notion
Putting these words in motion
I refuse to give joy to blues
Tell me why should we live between
Joy and blues

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if a money you put down
It's only money you can lose don't you know
Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
'Cause when your life is on the line
It's only life you can lose
Joy and blues
Joy and blues

Here we are in the big blue sea
Between faith and trust and hypocrisy
Between wants and needs, between joy and blues
Here we are in this ocean
Between fantasy and destiny, between quality and quantity
Between joy and blues, between joy and blues
Between joy and blues...

Choose well and make sure you don't lose
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if a money you put down
It's only money you could lose
Just choose well and make sure you don't lose
Pick your choice - choose well
When your life is on the line, your life is on the line
Your life is on the line, only life you can lose
Choose well choose well choose well make sure you don't lose
Choose well choose well choose well make sure you don't lose

// Brothers And Sisters //

I am my momma's son, you are your father's child
Sometime we act as if we hate each other
A different fate, a different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

Some are black and brown, others white and light
That's all the difference I can remember
Different face, different kind of smile
That's what we see but this we must realize

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

Earth is my mother, there is no other
So for you, so for all of I
Don't look me with a scorn
In time mankind was born

So for you, so for all of I
Love must live, hate must die
Don't join a rind
Don't you be so blind

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

I am no stranger in your town
Rasta seed is all around, yeah
Now when you're lookin' at me
Don't think I am your enemy

I am my father's son, you are your momma child
Sometime we act as if we hate each other
A different fate, a different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

Ah, brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all

Brothers and sisters, whom without life
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters
Brothers and sisters, we are all

Brothers and sisters, all an' all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all

// There She Goes //

Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie
Tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be wrong
I wear no disguise
But I trod on through those memories
That haunt me, that haunt me
I trod on through those memories
That haunt me oh man that haunt me

There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I count they'd be a million or two

But I walk on through that memory
That haunts me oh man that haunts me
I say I trod on through that angry grief
That taunt me, that taunts me

There she goes crying again
But her sexiness won't cover her shame
And there she goes she's taking her true love
But while she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How, how, how could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I could count they'd be a million or two

Now I walk on through that rocky reef
That wants me and that wanted me
Woman I walk on through that angry grief
That taunts me, I say that taunts me

Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie, lie
I tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be
Wrong I wear no disguise, no I
There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking her true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun
Days I've wasted with you child
If I count, they'd be a million or two

Now I walk on through those memories
That wants me oh man that wants me
I said I trod on through that angry grief
That taunts me I know it taunts me

There she goes crying again
But her sweet caress won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Why should I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun

There she goes crying again
There she goes crying again

// Talk //

Well, I know there is Jah out there to be found
Yes, I know there is Jah out there to be found

What they seem to have found
See they claim to be who they aren't
What they seem to have found

Falsely proclaimed, popes and priests
They claim they are the closet to God
But who are you, and how can you be
How can you be who you aren't?

All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
Dem chatty mouth a bark
Well all they do is talk

Woman, I know there is Jah out there to be found
Yes, my people I know we is Rasta all around
Now they think they know little of everything
But they don't know fart
Some intellectuals think they know a little of everything
But they don't know naught, naught

Hey, it's not what's on the outside my brethren
It's what's in the heart
And the real you is inside of you my sistren
You know who you really are

All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
That's all they do is talk
Watch them chatty mouth a bark

Blessed be Jah my rock who teaches my hands
To wage war and my fingers to do the battle
My love, my fortress, my strong hold, my deliverer, my shield in whom I've taken
Refuge and the one who subdues my people under me
Oh Jah, what is man? Man is breath, his days are like passing shadow
Oh, Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend, touch the mountains so that they
Smoke, flash forth the lightning and strike them, shoot forth thy arrows and
Confound them

I know there is revolution brewing, I can see
People, I know there is a solution in you and me
Now they think they can fool all the people
But they can't and they ain't
Yes, they think they can fool all the people
But they ain't 'cause they can't

Falsely proclaimed leaders
They claim they're the leaders of men
But what is this, who are you?
And how can you be, how can you be
Who you ain't?

All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back...
Them chatty mouth a bark
Yes all they do is talk
Them chatty mouth a bark
And all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back...

All they do is talk, them chatty mouth a bark...

Them chatty mouth a bark and them can't defend them talk

// Rebel In Disguise //

If you don't see me smiling
It got nothing to do with you
My papa been on the rock so long
Inherited a permanent screw...

If you don't see me smiling
It ain't no concern of you
My mama been on the rock for so long
Inherited a permanent screw...

So you won't even know me
'Cause you can't look me in the eye
Well only then my friend you would see
That I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And I am a rebel in disguise
We are rebels in disguise
We are rebels in disguise

If you don't catch me smiling
Said I have got serious on my mind
Want to tell you a little story
We are living in a serious time...

Said a fire deh, said a fire deh
Fire deh a mus mus tall
You think a cool breeze
Life is real hard
But you think it gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me
The baby crying

You come and ask us for a dollar bill
And we give you ten
Simply mean you should not be coming back again
Simply mean you go home and learn to help yourself

You are putting, you are putting on the pressure
Making it, making it much harder

If you don't see me smiling
It ain't got nothing to do with you
...
Then again you might have done something wrong
And you don't know where you belong
...
So you won't really know us

We are rebels in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
Fire de a mus mus tail
And you think a cool breeze
Your life is real hard but you think it's gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me

// X Marks The Spot //

// African Herbsman //

Oh, twinkling we
Can't see the right roads when the streets are big
That old slave mill might grind slow
But it grinds fine
African Herbsman why linger on
Just concentrate 'cause heaven lives on
Retire slave men will look with a scorn
With a transplanted heart
That's how quick they have to part
That's how quick

The remembrance of today
Sad feeling of tomorrow oh yeah
African Herbsman seize your time
Taking illusion to the edge of my mind
Taking loses down through my life
Down through my life yes
That's how quick
That's how quick

Do they part yes they part
In remembrance of today oh yeah
African Herbsman why linger on
Just concentrate 'cause heaven lives on
Retired slave men will look with a scorn
With a transplanted heart 'cause that's how quick
That's how quick

The remembrance of today sad feeling of tomorrow
Lead me oh Lord, Lord, Lord I pray
African Herbsman...

Oh, twinkling we
Can't see the road when the streets are big
That old slave mill might grind slow
But it grinds fine
African Herbsman seize your time
Taking illusion on the edge of my mind
Taking loses down through their lives
Down through their lives
The African Herbsman...

// World So Corrupt //

When will the blind see, when will the deaf hear
Why should the babe shed so many tear drops
And the wicked man not even a sigh
And those wicked men not even a sigh

'Cause we are living in a world so corrupt
We are living in a world so corrupt...

Lies they sell cheaper than bread
What they do starve the people of truth
Secretly the system programme the pain
In disguise of every day life problems...

We are living in a world so corrupt...
Yeah, I am living in this world so corrupt
You are living in a world so corrupt

There is a way which seems so right to men
But it end leadeth to destruction
Even in gladness the heart weeps
And the end of joy is grief
Oh, the end of joy is grief

Don't lose your way find it today
And don't drop the speed, people in need
Don't lose your way, find it today
I don't drop my speed, the people in need

We are living in a world, living in a world, living in a world
Mama, I have got to change it
We are living in a world, living in a world, living in a world
On daddy, oh daddy, I remember you told me
Living in a world, living in a world, living in a world
That's so corrupt now, that's so corrupt now
Living in a world so corrupt, got to be tough
Got to be rough, got to be tough, got to be rough now

// Garden //

In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We conquer them all

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of wickedness
You reap what you sow
There the youth should dare not go
Remember what you've been told

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of fruitfulness
You plan and it will grow
There death is of no threat
Life ever flows

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of happiness
Where life is at its best
Despair is far from near
I am free from all material care

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We've conquered them all

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

Never spare your rod from me...

Jah never spare that rod from me
I need it desperately

// Mama //

Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
If then they knew him
They'd have passed right by
Oh, Joseph's a man of many women, feel no way
Oh, always remember you are the first of them

So oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
The other day
Then they would know just where they belong
If they could see where you're coming from
Just the other day
They would know just where they belong

Let stumbling blocks fall out of your way
Lord know, Lord knows your reward shall be great
They were broken off through their lack of faith
But because of your faith you are still in place
Woe Mama, if they could see where you're coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where you are coming from
If they could see where you are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong

Ah my children
Oh Mama
Fret not for me
I know Jah will be there
Eternally

If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
If they could see where we are coming from
Then they would know just where they belong

Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
Ain't no lie
If then they knew him
They would have passed right by
So many called but you were chosen
And so you will remain outspoken
Oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong

Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
Ain't no lie
If then they knew him
They would have passed right by
So many called but you were chosen
And so you will remain outspoken
Oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong

If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
Then they would know
Yes they would know

// This One //

History been renamed
Time have no friend
Who you a go warn, when the real war come on
A no we you have to warn when the truth bust out

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one...

Malcolm X, Garvey, Martin, Marley, Mohammed, Yesus Christ
Strive and free your life
Don't play their games
Don't put your mind to waste, don't put your mind to waste

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one

Propaganda machine working overtime
Now more than ever on the younger minds
Don't just believe everything you see on the TV
Don't just believe everything you read in the magazine

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one

People have their place
Race has its pace
Each blow a the right one
Every blow carries a weight

No giving up in I, I will keep the faith
No giving up in I, fight them racist hate
No no no no no no no no you can't do nothing 'bout it
You can't do nothing 'bout it

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
I am the one that is this one
We are the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one

This is the one that is this one
It a the right one, it a the real one...
