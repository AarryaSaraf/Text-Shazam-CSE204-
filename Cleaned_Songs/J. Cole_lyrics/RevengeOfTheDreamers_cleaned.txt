// Lil Niggaz (Snippet) //

Yeah, ain't nothin to it but to do it, Nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, Nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly

// Revenge Of The Dreamers //

Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Hook:]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

War stories, got tour stories
Pop four whores on the top floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick, that's my ex-bitch, homie, in fact I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slimmin' but her eggs get runny, funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money, from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow up dolls, cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!

[Hook]

// Blowin' Smoke //

Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?

Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up

// Bitchez //

[J. Cole:]
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless

This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to

[Hook x2:]
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
Where did your bitchez go?

[Bas:]
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?
Bitch, I don't care
Damn, you niggas so bitchless
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers
Got a bitch like a diamond
Bitch got no flaws
See the switch when she walk
Give the bitch an applause
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want
Fly to another continent if I want
Ride through the projects if I want
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Omen:]
Yeah, TDK, TDK
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite
I don't talk much, but I say a lot
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot
When we sweating in the dark don't run
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run
She a square but that ass rotund
She let me cut samurai shogun
Know you heard bout the backstroke
I can make your perm turn to an afro
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches
Nice girls, classy women
I'm too official
Dreamville, nigga too official
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Hook x2]

[J. Cole:]
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch

[Hook x2]

// Crooked Smile (Original) //

They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook:]
A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

Listen
I got a story for ya. When I was 17
I had a name that was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nothing new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin', going no where
I figured "Fuck it. It's a couple hoes here."
I might as well sign up
And climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse
Spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage
I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like i dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga
DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat
Fast. the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak
That is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger
That killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again I beg my mom for braces
Then I had a crooked

[Hook]

Growing up just a young knuckle head running wild
Momma youngest everybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile
Snagga tooth nigga for a while
Liftin up my pillow tooth fairy never came around damn
We was po, but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily
Lookin', wondering how my teeth would grow
They came slow and out of line
I couldn't comprehend the significance at the time
This crooked smile was just another sign
Saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah remember Brandy Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga sosa
I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear
J's drop. he got a fresh new pair
And there I was with hand me downs
Turned into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention with this crooked smile

[Hook]
