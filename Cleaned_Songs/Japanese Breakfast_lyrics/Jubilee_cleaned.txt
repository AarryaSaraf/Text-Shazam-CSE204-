Album: Jubilee

// Paprika //

Lucidity came slowly
I awoke from dreams of untying a great knot
It unraveled like a braid into what seemed were thousands of separate
Strands of fishing line
Attached to coarse behavior it flowed
A calm it urged, what else is here?

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush
Oh it's a rush

But alone it feels like dying
All alone I feel so much

I want my offering to woo, to calm, to clear, to solve
But the only offering that comes
It calls, it screams, there's nothing here

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush
Oh it's a rush

// Be Sweet //

Tell the men I'm coming, tell them count the days
I can feel the night passing by like a mistake waiting for me
Caught up in my feelings, overthink the truth
Fantasize you've left me behind and I'm turned back running for you

Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better

Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something

So come and get your woman (Come and get your woman), pacify her rage (Pacify her rage)
Take the time to undo your lies, make it up once more with feeling
Recognize your mistakes and I'll let you back in
Realize not too late, loved you always

Make it up to me, you know it's better
Make it up to me, you know it's better

Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
Be sweet to me, baby
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in something

// Kokomo, IN //

If I could throw my arms around you
For just another day
Maybe it'd feel like the first time
Now that you're away
I'll just spend my life not knowing
How it'd feel to

These days I can't shake the awful feeling
I'm missing something I can't place
Is that you?
Manifesting like the fear of an oven left on
God, I felt so much back then
I was soft as a dune

If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
Just know that I'll be here longing

I'll wait, passing time just popping wheelies
And kicking round this flyover state
Watching you show off to the world the parts I fell so hard for
God I wish we could go back there
Left alone in my room
I know they deserve you too
And maybe I'm not that worthy

If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
Just know that I'll be here longing
If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
You know that I'll be here always

// Slide Tackle //

I want to be good
I want to navigate this hate in my heart
Somewhere better
I want to feel it
But with the feel there is an ache I meet
To desire living

Don't mind me while I'm tackling this void
Slide tackling my mind
This weight feels like
I'm wrestling with my head
Obsessing in the dark

So be good to me, be good to me
You and me have always had a good time
And what else is left babe?
So be good to me, be good to me
The day is not a wash until you say

Don't mind me while I'm tackling this void
Slide tackling my mind
Don't mess with us
I'm wrestling with my head
Obsessing in the dark
Obsessing in the dark
Obsessing in the dark

// Posing In Bondage //

Can you tell I've been posing
This way alone for hours?
Waiting for your affection
Waiting for you
Done up and drunk
Done up and fixed on
All of the nights you turned away my touch

Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage
Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage

When the world divides into two people
Those who have felt pain and those who have yet to
And I can't unsee it, although I would like to
Posing in bondage, I hope you come home soon

Closeness
Proximity
I needed
Bondage
Closeness
Proximity
I need it
Bondage

// Sit //

Hear my name in your mouth and I'm done for
Say to sit on your face, on those arms
It's a chase sequence on loop
It's the life that you chose and it kills me

Caught up in the idea of someone
Caught up in the idea of you
That's done too soon

It's your name in my mouth I'm repeating
It's the taste of your tongue I can't spit out
I keep watching the way he looks through you
I keep watching your ways, I miss it all

Caught up in the idea of someone
Caught up in the idea of you
That's gone too soon

// Savage Good Boy //

I want to be your man
I want to be your man
I want to be your savage good boy
I want to take care of you

When everybody's gone
I want you to be the one that I come home to
The one that's up waiting

I want to make the money until there's no more to be made
And we will be so wealthy I'm absolved from questioning
That all my bad behavior was just a necessary strain
They're the stakes in a race to win

I've got a five year plan
I've got a pension and six condos
A billion dollar bunker for two

And when the city's underwater
I will wine and dine you in the hollows
On a surplus of freeze dried food

I want to make the money until there's no more to be made
And as the last ones standing we'll be tasked to repopulate
And as you rear our children know it's the necessary strain
They're the stakes in the race to live

// In Hell //

With my luck you'll be dead within the year
I've come to expect it
There's nothing left to fear, at least there's that

Face to face and at my hands I snowed you in
With hydrocodone
Layer by layer 'til you disappeared

Hell is finding someone to love and I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't see you again

Wheeled you in laid on your side
I cried and cried and at my signal
They stopped your heart and then you died

And under the fluorescents another sterile room
Where no one ever tells you just how clinical death looks
And I can't unsee it, the two shots it took

Hell is finding someone to love and I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't see you again
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't feel it
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't, I can't

// Tactics //

Tried, tried to recall
Memories of peaches, the sun on my neck
And I guess, without you I would attach myself too
Without much discretion of who

So I had to move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me

So say, say what you want
Dose up on fiction, disfigure the truth
While I walk, life beating on
Aching for others, with love that stops short

A love that has to move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me

// Posing For Cars //

Woke from a dream in which you'd left me
Posing for cars on the American stoop
Don't make me beg you just 'cause you can
I'm just a woman with a loneliness
I'm just a woman with needs

And how could you ever conceive
How much I need you, how truly barren I can be?
They say that time, it is the only certainty
But it's been 1:00 for hours
Oh the day is long untangling

Can't sort release from what I sold you
Is this what it takes to enjoy the day?
All of my pleasures left on display
I'm just a hollow root pushing through
I'm just the empty space inside the room

And how could you ever conceive
This adolescent heart skipping beats?
When all your love, it grows full and firm beneath
Without a festered thought, without an emerald want
Just a single slow desire fermenting
