// Scream //

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it

[Janet Jackson:]
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Somebody please have mercy}
{'Cause I just can't take it}

{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
You just, you just

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson):]
I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
(You keep changin' the rules)
(While I, I keep playing the game)
(I can't take it much longer)
(I think I might go insane)
Ah, baby

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie)
{Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

"A man has been brutally beaten to death by police after being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect. The man was an 18-year-old black male..."

[Janet Jackson (Michael Jackson):]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
(Baby) Whoa

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you wanna scream)
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream

// They Don't Care About Us //

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, no
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're raping me of my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
Set me free

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black man, blackmail
Throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, no
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong or right me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

// Stranger In Moscow //

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow. Hee
Lord have mercy

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator in Russian:]
"Зачем приехал к нам ты, враг, от запада? Признайся.
Приехал чтобы украсть от нас великие достижения народа?
Великие труды рабочих?
Признайся. Подкупить народ богатством запада старался?"
[English translation:
"Why have you come, the enemy, from the west? Confess.
Have you come to steal from us the great achievements of the people?
The great accomplishments of the workers?
Confess. Have you tried hard to bribe the people with the riches of the west?"]

[The Notorious B.I.G. {Michael Jackson}:]
Listen, I got problems of my own (Uh)
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone (Uh-huh)
Even in my home, I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be (Uh)
My friends, but they ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean (Uh-huh), I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin', I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm 'a kill a nigga, I ain't joking, Indo smoke got me chokin', (Uh-huh)
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow (Uh-huh)
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door (Uh)
A real set of peoples to watch my back (Uh-huh)
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby {This time around, yeah}

// Earth Song //

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?

What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

It's our planet's womb
(What about us?)

What about animals?
(What about it?)
Turned kingdoms to dust?
(What about us?)
What about elephants?
(What about us?)
Have we lost their trust?
(What about us?)

What about crying whales
(What about us?)
Ravaging the seas?
(What about us?)
What about forest trails
(Ooh, ooh)
Burnt despite our pleas?
(What about us?)

What about the holy land
(What about it?)
Torn apart by creed?
(What about us?)
What about the common man?
(What about us?)
Can't we set him free?
(What about us?)

What about children dying?
(What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh, ooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us?)

What about baby boy?

What about the days?

What about all their joy?
