Album: SigningOff

// Tyler //

Appeal to the governor of Louisiana
You may get an answer the process is slow
Federal government too much to help him
It's been nearly five years
And they won't let him go

[Chorus:]
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so
What right do we have to say it's not so
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so
What right do we have to say it's not so

Testify under pressure, a racist jury
Government lawyers its all for show
With rows of white faces
False accusations
He's framed up for murder
They won't let him go

[Chorus]

Police gun was planted
No matching bullets
No prints on the handle, no proof to show
But tyler is guilty the white judge has said so
They show him no mercy
They won't let him go

[Chorus]

Appeal to the governor of Louisiana
You may get an answer the process is slow
Federal government too much to help him
It's been nearly five years
And they won't let him go

[Chorus]

// Burden Of Shame //

There are murders that we must account for
Bloody deeds have been done in my name
Criminal acts we must pay for
And our children will shoulder the blame

I'm a British subject, not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame [Repeat]

As a nation we're following blindly
No-one stops to question why
Our money's supporting an army
And a boy in Soweto dies

I'm a British subject, not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame [Repeat]

Must we go on ignoring forever
The cries of an African son
There's a soldier's hand on the trigger
But it's we who are pointing the gun

I'm a British subject, not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame [Repeat]

// I Think It's Going To Rain Today //

Lonely, Lonely,
Tin can at my feet.
Think I'll kick it down the street,
That's the way to treat a friend

Broken windows and empty hall ways
Pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away.
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today.

Right before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today.

// Little By Little //

Poor man's anger rising.
The ostrich hides his head.
Soon the red blood will be boiling.
And blue blood will be dead.
While we say.

Little by little by little,
And stone by stone.
Rich man's mountain comes crumbling down

Poor boy sleeps on straw,
The rich boy sleeps in bed.
That fat boy fills his belly,
My poor boys's a dead,
While we say.

Little by little by little,
And stone by stone.
Rich man's mountain comes crumbling down.

The rich man drives his car past,
The poor man on bare feet.
That rich man do get what he wants
The poor must know defeat,
While we say.

Little by little by little,
And stone by stone.
Rich man's mountain comes crumbling down.

// Madame Medusa //

From the land of shadows
Comes a dreadful sight
Lady with the marble smile
Spirit of the night
See the scourge of innocence
Swinging in her hand
Hear the silent suffering
That echoes through the land

From the tombs of ignorance
Of hate and greed and lies
Through the smoke of sacrifice
Watch her figure rise
The sick the poor the old
Basking in her radiance
Men of blood and gold

In her bloody footsteps
Speculators prance
Men of dreams are praying
For that second chance
Round her vacant features
Gilded serpents dance
Her tree of evil knowledge
Sprouts a special branch

Madam Medusa
Madam Medusa
Madam Medusa

Knock her right down
And then she bounce right back
Knock her right down
And then she bounce right back
She gone off her head
We've got to shoot her dead
She gone off her head
We've got to shoot her dead
Run for your life before she eat you alive
Run for your life before she eat you alive
Move out of the way 'cause you're blocking out the day
Move out of the way 'cause you're blocking out the day

// Strange Fruit //

Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is a fruit for the crow to pluck
For the rain to wither, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop.
