// All I Want To Do //

I don't like the work but true i need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
People all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you

Time after time I say to myself
Working all my life isn't good for my health
Get old, get tired, get put on the shelf
I do all the work, someone else gets all the wealth
Wish I was on an island in the sun
Where I wouldn't have to worry how to get things done

I don't like the work but true i need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
People all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you

Day after day becomes more of a grind
Bills pile up, moneys harder to find
Trying to get ahead money's harder to find
If I don't give it up I'm gonna lose my mind
Wish I was on an Island in the sun
Where I wouldn't have to worry how to get things done

I don't like the work but true i need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
People all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you

// You Could Meet Somebody //

You could meet somebody, you never know
From brief encounters habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Life in the shadows ain't no fun

It's easy getting up there
Never think of coming down
Not hard to say "I want you"
When you're floating on a cloud
But you know that lonely feeling
When nothing's going right
'Cause it's only the beginning
Of a cold and sleepless night

You could meet somebody, you never know
From brief encounters habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Your only chance is to turn and run

It's harder getting up there
And it's painful coming down
And now you can't see clearly
Beneath the thunder cloud
And the loneliness gets longer
When nothing's going right
And things ain't getting any better
With another sleepless night

You could meet somebody, you never know
From brief encounters habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Your only chance is to turn and run

// Tell It Like It Is //

[Chorus:]
I sus' a tell it like it is, yeah
I sus' a tell it like it is, oh yeah
I've got to be blatant in this time
Jus' like I know 1 + 1 no make 9 [Repeat]

Now what was I saying about being blatant
You got to be blatant in an argument
You got to make sure your feelings are felt
Perfect example for you from me
Watch lying politicians me seh on me T.V.
Pay big big money for the licence fee
(At the same time them a try fi fool we) [Repeat]

[Chorus]

I've got to be blatant in this time
Now let me tell me more about being blantant
You got to be blatant me seh
With product you invent
If you don't patent it
You nah see a cent
You have no money fi go pay up your rent
If you crash fi your car
Or you in an accident
If it's not your fault you be blatant

[Chorus]

Now I get serious about being blatant
Police come and mess with me pon the pavement
They say oi' where you going, what you doing here?
I just leave mi house fi go buy a tin of beer
Another example of being blatant
South Africa police a kill the innocent
Fire live ammunition me seh into a crowd
If that's not blatant murder
Then murder can't be found [Repeat]

[Chorus]

// The Elevator //

1st floor decide what you'll be one day
With a head full of comment and nothing to say
2nd floor mixed up it happens that way
Soon you realize that listening don't pay
3rd floor in limbo, no easy moves
Up or down it's time to choose

[Chorus:]
The elevators going up
Quick the door's about to shut
Too late we're full just hang around
It won't be long - it won't be long before it's down

4th floor the job hunt and all that you ask
Is an honest day's pay for an honest day's graft
5th floor you may make a little more money
Now it's apparent downstairs ain't so funny
6th floor a mortgage, a collar and tie
2 weeks vacation in june or july

[Chorus]

7th floor expenses and private schools
Pushing a pen you're not turning the tools
8th floor position, respect and acclaim
Move up the 9th for fortune or fame
10th floor for investment and real estate
Recouping the redies before it's too late
11th floor the penthouse the final cut
With a head full of comment and a mouth that stays shut

[Chorus]

// Looking Down At My Reflection //

Looking down at my reflection
In the puddle at my feet
Things don't seem so real down there
Or maybe I don't see

I see no starvation
I don't see any pain
I see myself not helping
Just a loner in the rain

Looking down at my reflection
In the puddle in the ground
Things are getting clearer now
I can see a thunder cloud

I see gross injustice
I see evil men
I see myself repeating
The same old words again

Looking down at my reflection
In the puddle lying there
Now I decide to change my mind
And show the world I care

I care about my fellow man
Being taken for a ride
I care that things start changing
But there's no one on my side

// Don't Blame Me //

I think its only fair to say
We'd welcome riches down our way
No stigma knotted in my hair
I want to be a millionaire

Nevertheless I must insist
A thought is spared for those who missed
The handouts when it came to wealth
To education and good health

The time has come now all can see
As seeing this is killing me
our future victim to command
Together we can lend a hand

So don't blame me for wanting more
The facts are too hard too ignore
I'm scared to death of poverty
I only want whats best for me

But even so I'm holding on
I think the world can live as one
If only credence took the lead
The world would see a world to feed

An endless sea of blood that's spilt
Enough to sail an ark of guilt
And when we lend our helping hand
We'll have our green and pleasant land
