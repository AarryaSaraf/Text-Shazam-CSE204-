// You're Special //

Good morning sunshine
A sweet morning too
A flower that blooms every day

Such a perfect smile
That makes me dream a while
About all the things I see in you

It's all because
You're special
What else can I say
I can only say how much I love you sweet baby

You're special
It's how I feel when I am with you

You're special
Each and every way

You're special

You are a friend in time of need
Whatever I need I know you'll be there

Yeah. Yes I'm a man and a man is supposed to be strong,
But I can't go on without your love

That's all because

You're special
There's so much more I wanna do for you baby

You're special
I'm so in love with you

You're special
Touch me tenderly

You're special
Sugar. All the things you do to me. Yeah!

Girl you're so special
Uh baby. Some kind of lady
You're my kind of lady

You're special
Uh. Some kind of lady

You're special
Some kind of lady
My kind of lady

You're special
Some kind of lady

Nobody would know what you do to me
Lord knows what you've done for feeling free
Girl you give me what I never ever had before
You keep me risin' back for more

// Still //

Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

[Chorus:]
So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?

We lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love you
Still!

[Chorus]

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'cause I needed you so desperatly!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love you
Still!

// Wonderland //

Hello, honey, this is your lucky day
I've come to take you far, far away
We'll use love as our guide to the stars
And if I'm lucky I'll put a thrill in your heart

Come into (whoa, baby) this Wonderland of mine (This Wonderland of mine, girl)
(And I'll take control of your beautiful mind)
I can't tell you (Girl) just what to expect (Some times I don't know myself)
(Whoa, the joy you give is the pleasure you get)

Won't you come into this land of love (Come on, baby)
Won't you come into this love with me (Oh...)
(Won't you come into this love of mine)
It's for you and for me (Yeah)

Mr. Taxi driver, could you give us a ride
And take us down to, oh, Paradise Drive
Hurry, won't you hurry 'cause I just can't wait
Oh, one minute lost might be one minute too late

Sugar, don't you be afraid, no, no
Just take me by the hand and I'll show you the way
Ooh

Ooh...hoo...yeah
(It's for you and for me)
It's for you, baby
All I need, all I ever needed was you

Whoa, girl, let me take you to a (Wonderland)
Got so many thing we can do, girl
(It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in Wonderland)
(It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in Wonderland)

// Sail On //

Sail on, down the line
About half a mile or so
And I don't really wanna know ah
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried
Hold on to what we got
But now you're going
And I don't mind
About the things you're gonna say
Lord, I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Guess I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
All my friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see
That a small town boy like me
Just I wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking
I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time
Sail on honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on sugar
Good times never felt so good
Sail on
