// Girl, I Think The World About You //

Sweet little woman can't you see
That you're the only one for me
You make me feel good, so good inside
Stay by me woman for the rest of my life
And as I think of you more every day
There's only one thing I can say
And that's:

Girl, I think the world about you
Always thinkin' of you
Girl, I think the world about you
I'm always thinkin' of you

So many wonders in your world it seems,
You're the picture of a woman - a little girl's dream,
You seem so weak sometimes to be so strong,
You make a man like me finally to belong,
No words can say how much I need you so,
But oh my love I want the world to know

Girl, I think the world about you
Always thinkin' of you
Girl, I think the world about you
I'm always thinkin' of you

There's no words to say how much I need you so,
But oh sweet girl I want the world to know

Girl, I think the world about you
Always thinkin' of you
Girl, I think the world about you
I'm always thinkin' of you

// Just To Be Close To You //

Just to be close to you girl
Just for a moment, well just for an hour
Just to be close to you girl
Oh well ah baby aw

You know I've been thru so many changes in my life girl
Aw I've been up real high where I thought I didn't need anybody
Aw and then again I've been down real low where
There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul
You're my stone inspiration
Baby oh that's why I'm standin' here singin'
And opening my arms to you
I wanna say child why don't you
Take my hand and we'll live in love forever
Yeah take my hand ooh, we'll be alone you and me yeah

Take my hand girl
We'll live our lives together yeah together
Together yeah together
Just to be close to you girl
Just for the moment baby, just for an hour
Just to be close to you girl, hey, ooh

I've been out there searchin' so very long baby
Searchin' to find somebody just like you
And for some folks it takes a lifetime sugar
To find in this world a dream come true
Why don't you take my hand
Oh, we'll live in love forever yeah
Take my hand girl, we'll be alone you and me
Take my hand we'll spend our lives together,
Together, together, together
Just to be close to you girl
Just for the moment just for the hour
Just to be close to you girl
I need you baby

To make love to be loved by you baby
To have your warm body close to mine
To whisper words that make you feel like a woman
Girl I know our love will stand the test of time
Just to be close to you girl

For the moment baby, for the moment baby
For the moment baby
For the sugar, sugar, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
My arms are still burnin' girl
Ya got me yearnin' for your love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Fancy Dancer //

Have you found yourself in love before
Tell me ain't it a different kind of thang
So much lovin' such a real good feelin' child
The kind of feelin' good lovin' brings yeah
With your head on my shoulder
My head's a spinnin' round and around yeah
I hear the sound of sweet funky music
Oh even when there ain't no sound yeah
Visions of you my love dancin' in my head
The star in my life girl

Only one thing can be said
That you're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)

You're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yeah ooh
You're the only thing on my mind
You fancy dancer oh ha

Look'a here the way you move is such a freaky thrill
Baby it's the way you do your thing
I love the way you twist and turn your body girl
You're like a puppet on a string yeah
Shake it baby, shake it baby
Just like a fox strollin' down the block in L.A. oh
Drive me crazy sexy lady
You're so bad there's only one thing I can say yeah
(repeat chorus)

Girl you blow my mind you're so fine
My fancy dancer

// Thumpin' Music //

Threw a party late last night,
Drew a hundred people or more,
Dancin' every dance they knew,
Feet stompin' through the floor
(Happy people.) People everywhere.
Arms and feet were flyin',
Flyin' through the air.
(You can feel it all over.)
Something there wouldn't let me go,
Made me sing and it was all'

(Thumpin' music) Thumpin' music loud and strong.
(Thumpin' music) It keeps me dancin' all night long.
(Thumpin' music) Thumpin' music turns me on.
(Thumpin' music) Put the beat back there where it belongs.

That funky house is no longer standing.
We tore it down last night.
We was a bumpin', a swingin', a singin' aloud,
And screamin' 'Dynomite!'

We searchin' for another place,
It must be made of stone.
It's got to stand the pressure,
Of movin' and getting' it on.
(You can feel it all over.)
Ah that base was jumpin' loud and clear.
That's really what I want to hear.

(Thumpin' music) Thumpin' music loud and strong.
(Thumpin' music) It keeps me dancin' all night long.
(Thumpin' music) Thumpin' music turns me on.
(Thumpin' music) Put the beat back there where it belongs.

(You can feel it all over.)

(Thumpin' music) Thumpin' music loud and strong.
(Thumpin' music) Put the beat back there where it belongs.
(Thumpin' music) 
(Thumpin' music)
(Thumpin' music)

// Can't Let You Tease Me //

Say hey there missus
Can you spare just a minute to listen
there's something that I wanna say
I've been a lovin' you
From the moment we met
I'm in love every step of the way
But now I see
I got you
I don't mean you no good
You're running around with somebody else
You're no good no good why you treat me this way
You're only making a fool of yourself..yeah
Uh huh uh, the way you sho nuf turn me on
I love you
Even when you lead me on
I love you
When you try to please me
Girl, I can't let you tease me

[Chorus:]
Yeah, you've got me callin' you
Asking you for love each and every day
But I don't know much
But I know you got a lot to learn
You got to give all the love in return, yeah

I love you
The way you sho nuf turn me on
I love you
Even when you lead me on
I love you
And when you try to please me
But, I just can't let you tease me

[Chorus]

..Think that you get next to me
..Go on with your teasin' and your pleasin'
