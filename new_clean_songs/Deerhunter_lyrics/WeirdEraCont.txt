Send my regards
To those who suffer endlessly
Send my regards
To those who suffer hopelessly

// Operation //

Operation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear

I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you

Operation, you're not here
You can't love what you can't like

What you fear, what you fear
What you fear, what you fear

Operation, cover your eyes
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna feel you

Not near me, not near me
Not near me, not near me

Operate, operate
Operate, operate
Operation, operation
Operation, operation

Operation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear

I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you

Operation, you're not here
You can't love what you can't like

What you fear, what you fear
What you fear, what you fear

Oh
How did you know
It was so easy
To destroy her

Oh
How did you know
It was so easy
To destroy her

Operation, cover your eyes
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna feel you

Not near me, not near me
Not near me, not near me

Operation, cover your ears
You're not gonna like what you're gonna hear

I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you

// Vox Celeste //

Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay
Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay

In my room, oh, it's true

Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay
Stay, I don't want you to stay
Stay, I need you to stay

In my room, oh, it's true

Start over, start over
Start over, start over

Start over, start over
Start over, start over

Start over, start over
Start over, start over

// Vox Humana //

I haunted a basketmaker's shop
Spending days ripping pictures from magazines
Taping them to the walls of my prison
I remember walking by the sand
Each knob represented a different frequency range
And I remember holding the hand of the skeleton prince
And he swept me into his arms
And he, he had tremolo deep
In the back of his black eye sockets
And he said, "Do you want to come away with me
Into the pitch black pool?"
And I said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know"
Photocopied, the wind ripped through the trees
And all the stained-glass windows rattled
I haunted a basketmaker's shop in 1927
And on the beach in the summer there were thunderstorms constantly
And they were unpredictable
Nobody knew when they would come and nobody knew how long they'd last
Sometimes they'd only last five minutes and sometimes weeks
I haunted a basketmaker's shop
Because I had nowhere to go one long weekend
Stained-glass windows turning off and on
And the tremolo in the back dark corners
Cobwebs stripped, mildewed
I remember acoustic guitars and bells
I remember the cathedral
I remember cassettes, cathedral
I remember cassette, cathedral
I remember cassette, cathedral

// VHS Dream //

I've looked
I've seen, I've seen
I've looked
I will always see, I've seen

For the miracles
Of youth
I've looked
I will always see, I've seen

When friends go
Away for a while
They always
Come back

But now if friends
Go away for a while
Then they
Never come back

// Calvary Scars II / Aux Out //

Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest friends
Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest

Crucified on cross revealed
With finest wood and rope so thick
My arms, my wrists would bleed for weeks
My arms, my wrists would bleed for

Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest friends
Crucified with backstage pass
Crucified on drum throne
