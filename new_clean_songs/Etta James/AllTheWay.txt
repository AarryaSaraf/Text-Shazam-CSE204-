Album: AllTheWay

// All The Way //

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes

If it's real when somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

// Strung Out //

I will do whatever you say
It's got to be, it's got to be that way, yes it does
Because it's true, oh, oh yeah, it's true
That I'm strung out, strung out on you, on you

Alright, if you say one, just tell me, boy
I'm gonna start walkin' and if you say talk
Tell me I'm gonna open my mouth and start talkin', boy

I'm strung out, well, oh yeah, I'm strung out on you
Oh ha, on you, baby, on you, on you
You, you, you, you, you

Yeah, now listen, I was in such a romance, hey, hey
And I stopped off in Paris, France, yes I did
It was a whole lot of people knew me, oh yeah
But don't you know, don't you know that wouldn't do me, no, no, no, no

And I stopped off in Spain, everything, everything remains the same
I just needed you, needed you, you, you, talkin' about you
I just needed you, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

If you say, walk, darlin', I'll put on my best shoes and start walkin'
Hey, and I dare you to tell me to talk, all day and all night
I'm gonna be talkin', 'cause I'm strung out and well

I'm strung out on you, I'm strung out, strung out, baby, on you
Strung out on you, you, you, you, oh yeah, yeah
My goodness, I got a Jones, baby

Well, well, well, now listen now, now
Oh bay, oh yeah, well, well, now listen

I went to the family doctor, yes I did
And he used everything he had, yes he did
And he said, "Etta, your case is so sad, it's so sad"

You, you, I need you, I need you, you, you, you
Oh baby, I need you, I need you like the bees need the flowers
And like the trees need the sunshine
And I need only the one that I'm strung out, strung out on you
No, it's you, you, you, oh yeah, strung out on you

// Somewhere //

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Some day, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Some day, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, some day, somewhere

// Holding Back The Years //

Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone

Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arm of mater
Get to me sooner or later
Nothing ever could, yeah

I'll keep holding on
(I'll keep holding on)
I'll keep holding on
(Keep holding on)
I'll keep holding on
(Never let you go away)
I'll keep holding on

Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears, yeah
There's nothing here has grown

I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright

I'll keep holding on
(I'm gon' keep holding on)
I'll keep holding on
(Holding and holding and holding)
I'll keep holding on
(I'll keep holding, babe)
I'll keep holding on
(So tight)

I wasted all my tears
Wasted all those precious years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah, yeah and I'll

I'll keep holding on
(I'm gonna hold on, babe)
I'll keep holding on
(I'm gonna hold, hold, hold, hold on)
I'll keep holding on
(Can't let you go)

I'll keep holding on
(I keep holding and holding and holding on)
I'll keep holding on
(I can't let you go for nobody)
I'll keep holding on
(I'm gonna keep holding and holding, baby)

I'll keep holding on
(I, I)
I'll keep holding on
(I'll keep holding, holding on)
I'll keep holding on
(I'll keep holding on)

// Imagine //

Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
No people below us, above it's only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
No need to kill or die for and no religions too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing for the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Take my hand and join us
And the world will live, will live as one

// I Believe I Can Fly //

If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything
If I can see it, I can do it

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

I believe, I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me

If I can see it, I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

'Cause I believe in me
I believe in me

If I can see it then I can do it
If I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe, I believe I could fly
I believe I can touch the sky
Think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

I believe, I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe, I believe
I believe I can fly and I believe I can fly

I believe I can fly
I know, I know I can fly
I know, I know I can soar
See me running through that open door
I, I can fly

// It's A Man's Man's Man's World //

This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't, it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry the heavy load
Man makes the electric lights to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman, a woman or a girl

Now listen
Man thinks about little bitty baby girls and baby boys
Man makes them happy 'cause man, he makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

But this is a man, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

I said, "He's lost, lost in the world of a man, oh yeah"
And he's lost, lost in bitterness
This is a man, this is a man's world, oh yeah
This is a man's world

This is a man, man, a man's world
Oh, but it would be nothing without a woman or girl
I said it would be, it would be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Without a woman, nothing without a woman or a girl

This is a man's world, this is a man's, this is a man's world
I know, you know it this is a man`s world

This is a man's, a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing without a woman or girl
Without a woman or girl
This is, this is, this is a man, a man's world

// Purple Rain //

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another, oh no
Such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey, I know, I know times are wasted
It's time we all reach out for something new and that means you too
You say you want a leader but you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it, well, let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

// What's Going On //

Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying

You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today

Father, father
There's no need to escalate
Listen, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

You know we've got to find a way
To bring back love back here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
And just talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

Mother, mother
Every body thinks we're wrong
Oh, who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long

You know we've got to find a way
To bring back understanding today

You know we've got to find a way
And bring back some love back here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
And just talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, I tell you what's going on

Oh, what's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

Mother, mother
Father, father
Good God

// Calling You //

A desert road that leads to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend

I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we all know a change is coming
Coming closer sweet release

I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
...
