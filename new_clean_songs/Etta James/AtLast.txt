// Anything To Say You're Mine //

Oh, oh, I'm so blue
'Cause I'm worried over you
Oh I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you

You promised to write me
Each and every day
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away

Oh, oh, I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came

My heart cries for just one little line
Anything to say you're mine

Oh, oh...

Well I said a prayer
Every night
Hoping, hoping and praying
Someday, someday you'd write

Oh, oh, my heart cries for one little line
Anything to say you're mine

// Tough Mary //

(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Yeah, that's me
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
The boys would come from miles around
With presents every day
But when they'd call on Mary
This is what she'd say

Don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Just bring me diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
Well Mary, she's a very pretty girl
I guess she was born that way
But whenever they would tell her that
This is what she'd say

Don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Come on and bring me some diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

[Backup]
Tough Mary, Tough Mary, Tough Mary...

Oh, don't bring me posies
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
When it's shoes I need
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me flowers
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Don't bring me the sea
(Tough Mary is tough!)
Come on and bring me some diamonds
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
That'll suit me fine
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And I'll love you forever
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
And you'll be mine
(Tough Mary is tough!)

Oh, I'm tough
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Yeah, yeah I'm tough
(Tough Mary, Tough Mary)
Ooh...

// I Just Want To Make Love To You //

I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you

Love to you, ooohooo
Love to you

All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you

Love to you, ooohooo
Love to you

And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving in the whole wide world

All I want you to do is to bake your bread
Just to make sure that you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you

Love to you, ooohooo
Love to you, oooh

And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving in the whole wide world

Oh, all I wanna do, all I wanna do is cook your bread
Just to make sure that you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you

Love to you, ooohooo
Real love to you, ooohooo
Love to you, ooohooo

// Stormy Weather //

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time

Oh yeah
Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, stormy weather
And I just can't get my poor self together
Oh I'm weary all of the time
The time, so weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
Oh yeah if he stays away
Old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray
The Lord will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Oh I can't go on, can't go on, can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather, stormy weather
Since my man and I, me and my daddy ain't together
Keeps raining all of the time
Oh, oh, keeps raining all of the time
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah raining all of the time
Stormy stormy
Stormy weather
Yeah

// Girl Of My Dreams //

Boy of my dreams, I love you
Ohh, honest I do
Don't you know that you are so sweet?

Ohh, if I could just hold your charms
Ohh, here in my arms
Boy of my dreams, don't you know it's you?

Since you've been gone, ohh
Life, it don't mean a thing
Please, please, please come back to me
Ohh, ohh

Ohh, if I could just hold your charms
Ohh, here in my arms
Boy of, of my dreams, don't you know it's you?

Ohh, since you, since you've been gone, ohh
Life don't mean a thing
Please, please, please come back to me
Ohh, ohh

Ohh, if I could just, just hold your charms
Ohh, here in my empty arms
Boy of my dreams, don't you know it's you?
Ohh

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you

// My Heart Cries //

I was lost in the world of dreams
Counting every star
Shining overhead it seems

I was like a shepherd boy
Searching for his lamb
Here and there and everywhere

You came, whoa yeah, you captured me
You and all your charms
Oh yes, you set me free

We kissed and the world was ours alone
And my heart cried
Oh, I love you so

Then my heart cried
Oh, I love you so

Then my heart cried
Oh, I love you so
Love you so
Love you so

// It's A Cryin' Shame //

[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, shame
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah

[James]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You said you didn't wanna love nobody else
If you wasn't lovin' me, whoa baby
Yeah, don't you know you did me wrong, yeah
You kissed and she let you hold her
No tellin' what you might've told her
But we're through

[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, shame
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah

[Fuqua]
Well, you said you didn't wanna talk to nobody
Unless you was a-talkin' to me, but whoa, ooh yeah
You're talkin' to everybody you see right now, mmm
You smiled and you started winkin'
And I know just what you were thinkin'
Now we're through

[James & Fuqua]
If you believe in a better world, a destiny
A-turnin' back the hands of time
Baby if our love was meant to be
Oh we'll get together further on down the line
But for now it's a cryin' shame, shame
But for now it's a cryin' shame, yeah

[James]
Yeah, you said you didn't wanna be smackin' on nobody else
If you wasn't kissin' me
But you, you, you, you
You kiss everybody you see
You did it, forget it, admit it, let's quit it
Yeah yeah, we're through

[Fuqua]
You lied, you cheated
And I'm getting so doggone tired of being mistreated
Now we're through

[James & Fuqua]
Cry, cryin' shame, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cry, cryin' shame, whoo, oh yes mam, now right now
Cry, cryin' shame, cry cry cry cry cry
Cry, cryin' shame
