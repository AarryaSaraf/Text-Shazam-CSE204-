// Groove Me //

Hey there sugar darling
Let me tell you something
Girl, I've been trying to say
You look so sweet
And you're so, so doggone fine
I just can't get you out of my mind

You come a sweet taste in my mouth now
And I want you to be my spouse
So that we can live happily now
In a great big old roomy house

You know you got to groove me baby
Oh yeah
Well you make me feel good inside
Come on now groove me baby
I need your groove
Hey!

Hey there sugar darling
Let me tell you something
Girl, I've been trying for days
Gimme some lovin'
And some 20/20 huggin'
Ooh, you cute little thang

Well girl between you and me now
We don't need no company
No other man, no other girl now
Can enter into our world

Not as long as you groove me baby
Oh yeah
Make me feel good inside
Come on and groove me baby
I need your groove
Hey!

// Champagne & Wine //

Sittin' here thinking, about the times I roamed
Different girls, that I have known
Of all girls, that I have met
You are the one girl that I can't forget, listen

We had our time, now
Good and bad, now
I can't forget a man
I sho' ain't gonna forget him, now
Remember Side Stream
Where we used to meet
Making love, nobody but you and me

Champagne and wine
That's what you gonna get
Champagne and wine
What it's gonna be
Just as long girl you see about me
I'm gonna be, knocking on your door
I want the same love, that I had before, listen

I'm a man now
Full grown man
You got me eating from the tip of your hand
I don't mind eatin', long as you feed me
Good love and good ole sympathy

Champagne and wine
That's what it's gonna be
Everyday, is gonna just be like sunday
Everynight your gonna have stars in the sky

Ou giving you
Champagne and wine
I'm gonna give it to you
Ou, ou weeh
Ou, na na na na na na na na na na
Ou weeh baby
Giving you champagne and wine
I want you to love me, baby
I really do need you, honey
Really do wan't you baby...

// Dreamer //

Dreamer, dreamer
Like a foul I thought
That it could be
Dream on, dream on,
So that someone
Will understand me

What do I say
When I fell to much
I think by now
I'm wasting time
I'm going
Oh, Lord I'm gone
You are the essence
Of my mind

Lord dreamer
I'm a dreamer
Like a foul I thought
That it could be
Dream on, dream on,
Sure that someone
Someone will understand me

// Welcome To The Jungle //

Welcome to the jungle
We've got fun 'n' games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease

[Chorus:]
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me

[Chorus]

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down, YEAH!

You know where you are
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It' gonna bring you down!

// Misty Blue //

Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
Oh, but I can't
Just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good, baby
I think of the things we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue

Ooooh baby, I should forget you
Heaven knows I tried
Baby, when I say that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied
I've lied, I've lied

Ooooh honey, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you, my love
My whole world turns misty blue

Ooooh, Oh, I can't, Oh , I can't
Oh, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Ooooh, Oh, my love
My whole world turns misty blue
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue

// Boondocks //

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul down in the boondocks, that's right

And I can feel that muddy water
Running through my vein, yeah
I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds so familiar, whoa

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah, yeah, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I may go
I kwas born and raised down in the boondocks

I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet, yeah, it's so sweet, so sweet
When it grows wild on the banks down at old camp creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowing

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah, yeah, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I might go
I have my heart and soul in the boondocks

Now listen

It's where I learned about living, whoa yeah
Where I learned about love, alright
It's where I learned about working hard, uh huh
And having a little was just enough

It's where I learned about Jesus, oh yeah
And knowing where I stand, uh huh
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am

Feel no shame I'm proud from where I am
I was born down in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
Got my heart and soul in the boondocks

Give me a tin roof
A front porch and a gravel, a gravel road
And that's home to me
Feels like home to me, yeah, now

You get a line, I'll get a pole, yeah
We'll go fishing in the craw fish hole
Five-card poker on a Saturday night
Church on Sunday morning, yeah, yeah

I was born and raised
Down in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I may go
My heart and soul in the boondocks

I feel no shame, I'm proud from where I came
I was born and raised in the boondocks, yeah
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul down in the boondocks
In the boondocks

// Cigarettes & Coffee //

It's early in the morning
About a quarter till three
I'm sittin' here talkin' with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee, now
And to tell you that
Darling I've been so satisfied
Honey since I met you
Baby since I met you, ooh

All the places that I've been around
And all the good looking girls I've met
They just don't seem to fit in
Knowing this particularly sad, yeah

Butr it seemed so natural, darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes and drinking coffee, ooh now

And whole my heart cries out
Love at last I've found you, ooh now
And honey won't you let me
Just be my whole life around you
And while I complete, I complete my whole life would be, yeah
If you would take things under consideration
And walk down this hour with me
And I would love it, yeah

People I say it's so early in the morning
Ou, it's a quarter till three
We're sittin' here talkin'
Over cigarettes and drinking coffee, now, lord
And I'll like to show you, well
I've known nothing but good old joy
Since I met you, darling
Honey since I've met you, baby yeah

I would love to have another drink of coffee, now
And please, darling, help me smoke this one more cigarette, now
I don't want no cream and sugar
'cause I've got you, now darling
But just let me enjoy
Help me to enjoy
This good time that we'll have, baby
It's so early, so early in the morning
So early, so early in the morning
And I've got you
And you've got me
And we'll have each other
And we don't, we don't want nothing but joy, y'all
Nothing but joy...

// In The Evening //

In the evening, I say in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down
Ah, in the evening, baby, when the sun
When the sun goes down

Baby, when the sun goes down
When your good lover is not around
And when the sun goes down

Last night I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, I was just thinking, thinking to myself
Last night, last night, I lay a-sleeping
I was just thinking, thinking to myself

Yeah, and uh, how in the world can somebody
Mistreat you for somebody else
Oh, and when the sun, when the sun goes down

Yeah

The sun rises in the east, way in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west
Ah, and the sun rises, rises in the east
And it sets out, sets out in the west, yeah, yeah

Now listen

And ain't it hard, ain't it hard to tell
Which one, which one will treat you the best
Oh, oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

// Too Tired //

Laid down last night, too tired to wake
Had a chill this morning I was too tired to shake
Got a good poker hand, too tired to win
Can hear my baby knocking, too tired to let him in

And I'm tired, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm tired
I'm all tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Too tired to walk, too tired to run
Can hear my baby calling, too tired, too tired, too tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I regret, too tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Tired of prosperity, tired of luck
Sitting on a pin, I'm too tired to get up
I'm tired, yeah, yeah, I declare I'm tired
I said I'm tired, too tired, too tired for anything

Too tired, too tired, too tired for
Too tired
Too tired, too tired, too tired, too tired for anything
Anything
