Album: LoveSmokey

// I Can't Find //

Every now and then
Somebody comes into my life
Oh, and for a little while, it seems
They're the answer to my dreams, to my prayer
As sudden as they come, they start to fade
Like floating smoke rings
Oh, how can they stay with me when
They're only penciled in, you're always there
So I say, oh, my love
If you can find it in your heart
To do just one thing for me
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I don't want to look when I know where
Just what I need is
Oh, honey, you've got it with you
So what else can I do
But come to you, my love
And say take me in your arms
Hold me close, I need to feel you
Oh, to me, there's nothing like your touch
It's what I need so much
Oh, yes, I do, my love
So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Don't let another moment pass
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I can't find my way
To our very special somewhere
I can't find myself
'Cause without you, I'm just out there
I can't find that person
I want to put that much in
I can't find anybody like you
Who makes touching more than touching

I've been looking
There's just nobody around, ooh...
No sense looking
For who can never be found

So if you feel the need
To ever be with me again
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Come back, come back, come back, come back

I can't find sleep at night
I'm either watching TV or walking
I can't find any conversation
That means more to me than talking
I can't find satisfaction
Even when I do surrender
I can't find anybody like you
Who makes tender more than tender

I've been looking
There's just nobody around, ooh...
No sense looking
For who can never be found

I can't find anybody like you
Who gets my full attention
I can't find anybody who means
Enough for me to mention
I can't find that person
I want to put that much in
I can't find anybody like you...

// Love Is The Light //

Strange how we move through life
Feeling in the dark
Seeking to be a winner
But missing the mark
Then someone comes along
Like magic they appear
All of the shadows fade
And everything is clear

That's what you've done to me
Since you have come to me

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light

I, I was a one-man band
A loner for so long
I thought I was so in tune
But I was off-key and wrong
You, you brought to my song
Joy I could never find
Melodies haunt my heart
Sweet music divine

Oh, what you've done to me
Since you have come to me

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light
(The light)
Light, light

All the lonely nights
Filled with fear
One touch from you
And they all disappear
My fears all disappear

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and tender light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light, oh...

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
Sweet love, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light

I've seen the light
I've seen it shining so bright
A glow of light
So warm and lovely
I've seen the light
Love is the light

I've seen the light
I've seen it shining so bright
A glow of light

// (It's The) Same Old Love //

Ooh... baby...

All around, all I see
Is people giving up on love
Much too easily
Closing door before they've seen
Everything that might have been
Always searching, reaching
Chasing empty dreams
But, baby, that's not you and me
What we have is all we need

It's the same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

Yeah, hand in hand, side by side
Trust has been our guardian
Respect has been our guide
No regrets, so satisfied
We have no secrets left to hide
And I see the future
Shining in your eyes
That's the light that leads the way
Every hour, every day

It's the same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever
(Long as forever)
For as long as forever

(Same old love, every minute)
(Same old love, keep us together)
(Long as forever)

(It's the same old love that feels so new)
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it
'Cause the same old love's
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

(It's the same old love that feels so new)
Same old love, same old love
Same old love
But it's fresh, it's new
It's new, it's new
Same old love
Gonna keep us together
For the longest time
For as long as forever

Same old love
But it's new every minute
And all I know
Is I'm glad that I'm in it

Glad that I'm in it, glad that I'm in it
Glad that I'm in it, glad that I'm in it
Glad that I'm in it, glad
Same old love, same old love, love...

// Love 'N Life //

Don't you wish you could fly
Like all the birds in the sky
Everything would last forever
Nothing would ever die
Don't you wish life was easy
And every little thing you need
Was handed on a silver platter
Don't you wish it could be

Well, let me tell you this
It's hard to find
To most of us it's only just
A picture in our minds
Just try to keep your dreams alive

'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Everybody's got a learn to
Take another look at life
Everybody thinks the grass is
Greener on the other side
If you wanna wind up crazy
Try to figure all this out
Nobody has all the answers
Nobody's gonna show you how

Well, let me tell you this
One day you'll find
Happiness and loneliness
Are all a part of life
Just try to keep your spirits high

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
Push on, hold on, hold on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
(Keep pushin')

Wouldn't it be so nice
If we had everything we wanted
There would be nothin' left to do
Nothin' left to choose
I'm telling you, I'd really go
Out of my mind
If every wish did come true
Oh, baby

Well, let me tell you this
One day you'll find
Happiness and loneliness
Are all a part of life
Just try to keep your spirits high

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
'Cause life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Push on, push on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
Hold on
(Keep pushin', keep holdin' on)
That's love, that's love
Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

Oh, love, that's part of life
Pain, that's part of life
Joy, that's part of life
Tears, that's part of life
Smiles, that's part of life
Love, that's part of life
Love, life

Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love 'n life
Life's not typical
Love's not logical
Do, do, do, do
That's love, that's life

// Take Me Through The Night //

Well, well, well...

Put your arms around me, my sweet lover
Tell me things are gonna be all right
Sometimes I just need to hear
Your voice in the night
'Cause when you talk to me
I feel my troubles melt away
It doesn't what you say
Just as long as you can stay

Take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, baby, take me through the night, oh...
(Come on, baby, take me through the night)

When the hours seem to last forever
And it seems the night will never end
That's the time I really know
That I've got a friend
'Cause even when is seems
The sun will never shine again
The world is not so dark and cold
As long as I got you to hold

So take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night, ooh-wee...
(Come on, baby, take me through the night)
Yeah, come on, baby, take me through the night

Long as I near you so I can hear you
Talking to me, it's would be so nice
Come sit beside me, I need you by me
So you can guide me through the night

Do, do, do, do, do, do, ooh...
(Take me through the night)
Oh, yeah, baby

Ooh, take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night

Come on, come on, well
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night
Come on, you can do it right, baby
Oh, take me through the night, baby
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me through the night, baby...

// Everything You Touch //

Yes, baby...

The guys all fall over each other
Just to get next to you
They try too hard and they smile too much
I admit that I've done it too

How can you blame us for actin' like fools
Hangin' around like we do

When everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

I wish I knew what I could do
To stand out from the crowd, yes
To be the one (that you) you reach out to
And put your arms around

How can you blame me for wanting to be
The only that you see

When everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

Oh, touch me, baby
It would feel so good
Oh, kiss me, baby
'Cause I know it would
Ooh, love me, baby
Come on love me, love me
(Yeah)
Love me, oh
Love me, love me, baby
Ooh... yes

I hope someday I'll wake up and see
The one you're holdin' is me
(Holdin' me)

Everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

Everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say comes out right
Every time we meet
I feel a little lighter, lighter, lighter
(Tell me how can I)
Tell me how can I make you mine tonight
...

// Don't Wanna Be Just Physical //

The moment that I saw you, baby, I knew
That we could be lovers
There are other guys that want you, I know it's true
And you're only human
If I kiss you, kiss you all night
If I hold you, squeeze you real tight
Tell me, baby, tell me would it be right
If I can't be your only one

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me
I don't wanna get physical
Don't wanna be just ph-physical
I don't wanna get physical, baby
Don't wanna be that typical

Sexual attraction when that's all it's for
Can leave you so empty
Mental satisfaction can mean so much more
I wanna love you completely
Can you tell me that you really care
Or do you want me for a one night affair
Tell me, baby, 'cause if you're not prepared
To let me be your only one

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
But that's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me
I don't wanna get physical
Don't wanna be just ph-physical
I don't wanna get physical, baby
Don't wanna be that typical

Body language says a lot
It's sweet conversation, baby
Feels fine, but it's much better
When you've got mental stimulation
I wanna give you my all
I don't wanna take your body and run
I want you to be my one and only one
I don't wanna be your sexual urge
I want whatever's inside of us to merge

Ph-ph-physical
Yeah
Ph-ph-ph-physical
Don't wanna be just physical
Ph-ph-ph-ph-ph-physical
Well, well, well

Well, physical
I wanna give you my all

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me

// Come To Me Soon //

Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now
Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now

I am on fire and for what I require
Only you can fulfill my request
I have felt good and I have felt better
But you make me feel the best

Come to me soon
'Cause you know you're the one
Who can light up my life
Yes, you're the midnight moon
And the morning sun
And you light up my life

You got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much

I've come to find for my peace of mind
Your presence is mandatory
You've got a few little things that you do
That nobody else can do for me

Come to me soon
And we'll both have it made
Our love will be stronger
Yes, you'll break my balloon
And rain on my parade
If you're gone much longer

You got a soothing moving tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much

Come to me soon
Baby, baby, come to me now
Come to me soon, yes
Come to me now

Well, you got a soothing moving
Tender touch
Come and be with me
Because I need you so much, oh

Come to me soon
Yes, baby, yes, come to me now
Come to me soon as you can, my love
Come to me now...

// You Made Me Feel Love //

Well, well, well...

I say yes, I've been blessed
I couldn't begin to count the times I've said
Hey, do you know how good you make me feel
I know you know you do
I know it's all because of you
That I have watched my life turn inside out
Yes, and I've watched as you've become the key
To what my life's about

'Cause you made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
You made me feel love
And you made me believe in love
Like I never thought I could believe
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before

I say yes, yes I knew
The night I was introduced to you, yes
Do you remember that night as well as I do
I close my eyes and smile
As I roll back to the time
When I touched your hand
And floated off into space
Yes, and all those people down there
Looking up at us and say
Hey, how did you get to feel that way

'Cause you made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
Yeah, you made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
Oh, you made me feel love
And you made me believe in love
Like I never thought I could believe
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
Love before, love

Oh, you made me feel love
You made me feel love
You made me feel love
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before

You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, no, no, no
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before, ooh...
You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, ooh...

You made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before, well
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
(You made me feel love)
Ooh, yeah, you made me feel it
Yeah, you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel love
Like I've never felt love before
You made me feel touched
Like I've never felt touched before
You made me feel love, made me feel love
Made me feel love...

// Jasmin //

Jasmin has been running around in circles
Doing crazy things
Jasmin has been idolized by common men
Sought after by kings
She's a lady fair with whom they would share
Their every, every dream
She's a bundle of joy love
She's a femme supreme

Jasmin, well, has in her eyes such a look of love
One glance can turn you out
Jasmin, I've been thinking things since I saw you
I never thought about
Just one look from you was all it took
To make my insides melt
If I read you right, your eyes said you might
Feel the same way that I felt

In my dream, you see, you belong to me
And it makes me feel so proud
But in reality, to you I just may be
Another longing face in the crowd

Ooh you're feeling me so, baby
Making me love you
How much you don't even know, baby
But you'd better believe
My love is only meant for you

Jasmin, Jasmin, Jasmin
No need in asking
You know that I love you
Even if we never speak
Know that I love you, Jasmin
Know that I need you so
Know that I want you
I know you know

Jasmin, Jasmin, Jasmin
No need in asking
You know that I love you
You know you make me so weak

// Easy //

I'm so glad you've come to me, baby
We've got a mission for tonight
And the conditions are, oh, so right
There's no one here
There's only you and me in ecstasy
And love is running wild and free
And easy, easy

I think tonight's one o those night
We can't conceal what's in our hearts and minds
We must reveal lovers' secrets and we'll find
Our inhibitions
Take wings and they fly away
And all the things we want to say
Come easy, easy, easy

(Easy, easy)

A moment so tender, a time to surrender
Soft music flows from the speakers
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, it's all been designed
To make us weaker, weaker, weaker, weaker

These are some real precious moments
This time we're sharing as the world stands still
We're here comparing notes on every thrill
There's no one else
There's only me and you, a set for two
And all the things we want to do
Come easy, easy, easy, easy

Everything is nice and slow and easy
Everything is so easy
To be with you, to be with you, yeah
Yeah, it's easy, it's easy, it's easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy...

// Just Another Kiss //

A quarter after midnight, it's cool and sweet
A little bit of moonlight lying at my feet
We're slow dancing 'cross the living room floor
To a song I've heard a thousand times before
Must be the needle in the groove
Not my heartbeat that skipped
'Cause I'm no stranger to the touch of a woman's lips

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no, no, no, no, oh...
(Just another kiss)

I don't wanna linger on the fact
Ooh, but I can feel your fingers
Traveling down my back
And it's the right time for my usual line
But it all falls apart
When you turn your face to mine
Must be the touch of the night making my head spin
'Cause when I go anywhere, I haven't already been

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no

Now I can't remember my next move
Could it be you get to me
Uh, well, it's something we can only prove
With just another kiss
Just another kiss

Oh, it's just another kiss
Just another kiss, that's all it is
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss, yeah
Just another kiss
I swear it's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it
Oh, no

(Just another kiss, just another kiss)
I tell myself I can take or leave it
I can't quit
It's just another kiss
Just another kiss
It's something I won't miss
But my heart just won't buy it, oh...
Oh, no...

Just another kiss
Ooh, I keep telling myself, yeah...

// Unless You Do It Again //

I've been letting you love my hopes up high
You've been letting me down and I've had enough
I won't keep letting you tell me lover's lies
It's for sure, I'm nevermore
Falling for your stuff

Unless you do it again, uh-huh
Unless you do it again, uh-huh
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again, baby

I can't seem to keep away like I should
You can't seem to keep your feelings straight
I won't keep letting love make me feel so good
To let you use me like you choose
I just refuse to tolerate

Unless you do it again, ooh-wee, baby
Unless you do it again, oh-oh...
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again
And again and again and again and again

Unless you do it again, oh, yeah
Unless you do it again, ooh, baby
I swear, I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again, baby

Every time I take you back
You walk away and I tell myself
I knew it, yeah
Yet every time you come around
And say you're gonna love me
I say, do it, do it
I do it, do it, do it, baby
Do it baby, do it, baby
Do it baby, do it, baby
Do it

Well, I won't be your revolver door
You can't love and leave me anymore

Unless you do it again, ooh-wee, baby
Unless you do it again, do it
Unless you do it again
You can't love me then break free
Unless you do it again, no, baby

Unless you do it again
You're not being straight, I won't tolerate
Unless you do it again, oh...
I swear, I won't give in
I won't give in, I won't give in
Unless you do it again
...
