// Choosy Beggar //

Beggars can't be choicey I know
That's what the people say.
But though my heart is begging for love
I've turned some love away.

Maybe one was true love I'll never know which cause
your love is the only love to make this beggar rich.
I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

People say you can't have your cake
and then eat it too.
They tell me I've been making a mistake
waiting around for you.
Oh, I'm begging for love and
why can't they see that yours is the only love for me

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.

If beg you I must then I'll never give up cause
your love is the only love to fill this beggars cup.

I'm a choosy beggar (choosy beggar)
and your my choice.
[Repeat 2X]

// Ebony Eyes //

Wind in your hair, sun on your skin
You're looking good, girl, all over again
Hey there, Miss Brown
I want you to know I love you

Brown as the sand, you're soft as the shore
You're leaving me hungry, I'm crying for more
Ooh, we, baby, girl, you're such a score
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ooh...ooh...hoo...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...hoo...hoo...ooh...hoo...ooh...ooh...

Lips soft and tender, ready to speak
Her voice says, 'I love you' {I love you} and it's making me weak
Hey there, little girl, may I just say I love you
Tell 'em how you feel, Rick

Love is the brown skin girl in my eyes
Think it's time that I told you, don't you realize
You're such a queen, woman, you're such a prize
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
And I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I love you ebony eyes, oh, my
I need you, woman
I need you (Ooh...)
Oh, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I really love you (Ooh...ooh...), woman, I love you (Love you)
Ebony eyes (Ooh...), oh, my
I wanna say that I need you (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...), honey, I need you
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ebony eyes (Woo...woo...ooh...woo...hoo...)
Ebony eyes, oh, my (Hoo...)
Ebony eyes (Hoo...hoo...hoo...)
Girl, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Love you (Love you, love you)
Ebony eyes

// I Don't Blame You At All //

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I'm only payin' the price
For a trip I took to paradise
'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes
And what I thought was the look of love

Was only hurt in disguise
Too bad I didn't realize
Oh,but don't apologize
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I think it's pretty plain
Holdin' you would take a ball and chain
Every bet I made was all in vain
'Cause what I thought was an ocean of love

Was just a wee drop of rain
Too bad that it couldn't rain
Oh but you don't have to explain
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
That's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I said, what I thought was sure to last, to last
Was just a minute instead, too bad that I got misled
Ah but you don't have to hang your head
No, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
'Cause that's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool

// I Second That Emotion //

Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night and no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call
And a taste of honey's worse than none at all

Oh little girl, in that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Ooh

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made  for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules

Oh little girl
In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh

Oh little girl, In that case I don't want no part
I do believe that, that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion

So, if you feel like givin' me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl
I second that emotion
[FADES] - Ooh little girl I  second that emotion

// Really Gonna Miss You //

Really gonna miss you
It's really gonna be different without you
Time is gonna be hard and slow
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna be thinking about you
(Yes, I am)
Time came when you had to go

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

In your finest hour, I was there with you
And without you things won't be the same
But there's a higher power that we answer to
And you heard Him calling your name

Really gonna miss you
Everything about you, your smiling face
I know you want us all to be strong

Really gonna miss you
I know you're gone to that magic place
Singing you a brand new song

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

I'll miss you my buddy
I'll miss you my friend
I promise my love for you will never end

Really gonna miss You

// Shop Around //

When I became of age my mother called me to her side, 
She said,"Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride. 
And then she said, "Just because you've become a young man now, 
There's still somethings that you don't understand now, 
Before you ask some girl for her hand now 
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now." 

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop) 
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around) 

Aha, got  some things that I want you to know now. 
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now 
The women come and the women gonna go now 
Before you tell em that you love em so now. 

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop) 
Oh yeah, you better shop around." (shop, shop around) 

A try to get yourself a bargain son. 
Don't be sold on the very first one. 
A pretty girls come a dime a dozen, 
A try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin' 

Before you take a girl and say I do, now, 
Make sure she's in love with-a you now. 
My mama told me, "You better shop around." 

[Instrumental]

Ooh yeah, you try to get yourself a bargain son. 
Don't be sold on the very first one. 
A pretty girls come a dime a dozen, 
I gotta find one who's gonna give you true lovin'. 

Before you take a girl and say I do, now, 
Make sure she's in love with you now. 
Make sure that her love is true now. 
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now." 

My mama told me, "You better shop around (shop, shop) 
Aha, Don't let the first one get you 
Oh no cause I don't want to see her with you 
Aha, Before you let her hold you tight, ah yeah yeah make sure shes alright 
Before you let her take your hand my son 
Understand my son, be a man my son I know you can my son

// So Bad //

There is a pain, inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl I love you, girl I love you so bad
And if you leave my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

There was a pain but now you're here
And I don't fear a thing
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad
And she said, boy I love you
Boy I love you so bad

Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you

// What the World Needs Now (Is Love) //

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last 'til the end of time

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
Oh listen Lord, if you wanna know

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

No, not just for some, but for everyone

// You Really Got A Hold On Me //

I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
You treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
  (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
  (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you, but I need you
Don't wanna kiss you, but I need to
You do me wrong now,  my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me

You really got a hold on me
  (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter

Don't wanna spend another day here
I wanna split now, I can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
  (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
  (You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I said you really got a hold on me
  (I said you really got a hold on me)
You know, you really got a hold on me
