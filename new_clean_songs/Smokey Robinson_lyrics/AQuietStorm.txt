Album: AQuietStorm

// Quiet Storm //

Soft and warm a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn, break of dawn
A power source of tender force generatin', radiatin'
Turn me on, turn them on

You short-circuit all my nerves
Promising electric things
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow rings

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, blow baby

Windy sigh, weaken my
Butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm better free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your somber rain

Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my life

Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Blow baby, blow baby

// The Agony And The Ecstasy //

What's it all about this crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine?
How do I fit into your life
How did you get into mine?
I belong to someone else we know

Back when first we met
Oh, we thought for fun
One night together might be nice
Oh, but fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price

Oh, 'cause love like ours is never, ever free
You pay some agony for the ecstasy
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy, oh

Nights when you're alone, you know that I
Laid with someone else beside me
Oh, but you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be

Hey, but love like ours is never, ever free
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free
We got to pay some agony if we wanna have ecstasy, oh

Hey, got to pay some agony
If we wanna have an ecstasy, yeah
And we need each other desperately, don't we, baby?
And I'll never from you be free, no no

So you'll have to do the leavin' me, yeah
And you'll have to do the leavin' me, oh baby
'Cause I'm gonna pay the agony, yeah
'Cause, oh, lovin' you is ecstasy, that's what it is

And I'm willin' to pay the price, ho
'Cause I'll make it a sacrifice, ho yes, I will
And I'll never, never, never, never
Never, never wanna be free

// Baby That's Backatcha //

I put a song in your heart, so you say
Sing it out, let the world know what it's all about
If I make it possible for the impossible
To happen for you like you say, hey

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's the same thing you do for me
Baby, that's backatcha
Oh, baby, that's tit for tat
I'm givin' you this for that

You're flyin' high with your head in the clouds
Trouble comes along to bust your bubble
It's not incredible when I make it credible
Things seem much better for you

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's the same thing you do for me
Baby, that's backatcha
Oh, baby, that's tit for tat
I'm givin' you this for that

Baby, that's backatcha...

[?] and so, oh, baby, yeah
What it is exactly, you don't know what it is
So when you feel it, don't try to conceal it, no
Just let it happen for you

Baby, that's backatcha...

// Wedding Song //

What once was a dream
Will now become
Two hearts
Will now be one, hey

Were gonna write the book on happiness
Pages that time cannot erase
Starting here and now, oh...
Starting here and now, oh...
From this time and place

Oh, what a beautiful day
To take a vow
Pray that the things that we say
Will last from now on
I do take you for mine

Were gonna lock our lives together now
Unshakable, unbreakable embrace
Starting here and now
Starting here and now
Starting here and now
From this time and place

What love has joined together
Only love can put asunder
And we are
What love has joined together

// Happy //

I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's 'cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's 'cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's 'cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

// Love Letters //

I called you another letter today
Wish I could let you know what it had to say
Yeah, I wrote every line in the back of my mind
I didn't take the time to pen down

'Cause to write it on paper would do me no good
But since I don't know where to send 'em

Love letters
My life is love letters, baby
I'm a love letter, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
And I'll send myself to you, baby

I wrote some but they're fading now
Soaked with teardrops when they were sealed
Ah, though the sad tears stained message, they contained
But just a look at me can be revealed

Love letters, yeah
My life is love letters, oh baby
So many love letters, oh yeah
And I'll send myself to you, baby

My eyes are deep pools of tears
Deep enough for my soul to drown
And my face will explain how much my heart's in pain
There's really no need for me to write it down

Love letters, yeah
My eyes are love letters to you, babe
My lips are love letters, oh baby
My face, a love letter, yeah, yeah

My life, a love letter, yeah
And my heart, a love letter, oh baby
My soul, a love letter, yeah
I'm a love letter, yeah, yeah
And I send myself to you, baby

I feel like a love letter that you
Canceled into your life for fun
And then decided to replace every single trace
Of the living and loving that we had done

Love letters, yeah
I'm a love letter to you, baby
My life, a love letter, ah babe
My soul, a love letter, yeah

I'm a love letter, love letter
I'm a love letter, yeah
I send myself to you, baby

Ooh, love letters send to you, baby
I send myself to you, ooh
Love letters send to you
I send myself to you, yeah

I send myself to you, babe, oh
And I'll write myself to you, babe, oh
I send myself to you, baby, oh

// Coincidentally //

Fancy meetin' you here
Right at the place I said I'd never be
Fancy runnin' into you
Don't you think it's strange runnin' into me?

I said I would never come
'Cause to come here would only make me dumb
Yeah, I cursed and I swore not to come anymore
And play the fool like I did before
Dance above that empty room
Right outside your apartment door

And you're the last person that I expected
I might see right here
I guess it happened to be right here, yeah
Coincidentally

Fancy talkin' to you now
On the other end of the telephone line
Fancy hearin' your voice
Don't you think it's strange that you hearin' mine?

Well, I said I would never call
I'll just forget to love and have a ball
And the next time you saw me, you wouldn't even know me
'Cause I would be standing tall
Hey, fancy you should answer mine
I only let it ring 10 times, that's all

And you're the last person that I expected
So I know you'd be alone
Oh, I guess you must've picked up your phone
Hey, coincidentally

There's somethings I don't want you to know
Like when you said goodbye, it hurt me so
I'll be strong till the end, I won't break, I won't bend
I just don't think that I'd pretend
Hey, fancy you should find out
The only one true was your best friend

Only you're the last person that I expected
Hard to ever mention it too
Oh, I guess it came to the attention of you
Coincidentally

I let you know
(I let you know)
My way (my way)
Hey (hey)

Accidentally on purpose now (accidentally on purpose now)
Yeah (yeah)
Hey (hey)

I found out (I found out)
Oh (oh)
Coincidentally (coincidentally)

I let you know (I let you know)
My, my, my, my, hey (my, my, my, my, hey)
Well, well, well (well, well, well)

I found out (I found out)
I let you know, yeah (I let you know, yeah)
Accidentally on purpose now (accidentally on purpose now)
