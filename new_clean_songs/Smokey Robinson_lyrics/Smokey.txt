// Holly //

Holly made the rules
She laid down all the laws
Then broke the ones she made
Most folks would be afraid
To play the games that Holly played

When she was seventeen
She ran away from home
As fast as she could run
Said home was just no fun
There was an awful lot of doing to be done

Holly on a cloud in the sky
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh-ooh...
Holly on a cloud in the sky, yeah
Way above the crowd flying high

Holly made the scene
She's gone to every place
She never should have been
Oh, but she was hanging in
Couldn't tell her nothing then, no

Strangers in the night
Have paid a handsome price
To sleep in Holly's bed
She couldn't see that far ahead
To know that she'd become
One of the living dead

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh-ooh...
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh-ooh...

Holly was confused
She did some things
That even she could no explain
Oh, but now she's so in pain
The devil running through her veins

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh-ooh...
Way above the crowd flying high

How could Holly make such a great mistake
To take that she could beat the rap
In just one fling, it never happened

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh, Holly
Way above the crowd flying high
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Holly on a cloud in the sky
Ooh, life is passing by, yeah
Way above the crowd flying high
Ooh, life is passing by...

// Medley: Never My Love / Never Can Say Goodbye //

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love, no
Never my love

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no
I never can say goodbye, ooh...

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
To start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says turn around, you fool
You know you love her more and more
Tell me why is it so
I can't let you go, no

I never can say goodbye, no
Never, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh, no matter how much I try
Ooh, yeah, never, never

How can you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends on you

Ooh, tell me why is it so
I can't let you go, no

I never can say goodbye, no, never
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no matter how much I try
I just can't say goodbye
No, no, ooh, ooh, no
Oh, I never can say goodbye, no, never...

// A Silent Partner In A Three-Way Love Affair //

Nothing I can say against the man you love
Nothing I can say, 'cause I don't blame you
For feeling like I do
Your man happens to be my best friend, no, no, no
The only hang-up is I love you too

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

Vividly I can remember when he and I were boys
'Cause that was when he gave me my very first clue
While rapping about the woman
Who would share our future lives
We both painted a picture that is you

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

It could have been worse
I mean, what if a stranger had found you first
Since it wasn't me, then I'm glad it was him
'Cause to know you this way is better
Than never to know you at all

A thousand times I've asked myself
If I'd take you if I could
But I'm sworn to silence by the unspoken oath
If we three could talk about it
It might do me some good
But I fear to speak might make me lose you both

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
I'm a silent partner in a three-way love affair
Silent partner, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

A silent partner in a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner

A silent partner in a three-way love affair

// Just My Soul Responding //

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

A few years ago on my birthday
I had just become twenty-one
(I remember)
I had a lot to live, said I had a lot to give
Till a man comes to had me a gun
And though that war he sent me to didn't claim me
If I'm bitter don't blame me

It's just my soul responding
Don't you try to tell me I'm unpatriotic
I deserve an explanation
I can't help but wonder if you really got it
It's just my soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding

This land once belonged to my father
And to his father before him too
Let me tell you now, I'm on a reservation
Living in a state of degradation
What's a soul suppose to do?
'Cause I'm out, pushin', right?
I'm not in doubt

When it's just my soul responding
Oh, to seeing little hungry children
In the land of plenty
Just my soul responding
Oh, to doing lots of needing and never having any
It's just my soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding, soul responding

I was born and raised in the ghetto
On the rundown side of the track
And there are forces who do everything they can do
To hold me back because my skin is black
Oh, don't they know I want mine, hell, it's about time

It's just my soul responding
Oh, to being second-class in a land I helped to form
Just my soul responding
To too many roaches and not enough heat
To keep my babies warm
In this land I helped to form
I've got too many roaches and not enough heat
To keep my babies warm
It's just my soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding, soul responding

It's just my soul, it's just my soul
It's just my soul, it's just my soul
It's just my soul, it's just my soul
Soul responding, soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding

// Sweet Harmony //

This song is dedicated to some people
With whom I had the pleasure of living
Over half the years I've lived 'til now
When we come to our fork in the road
And though our feet may travel
A different path from now on
I want them to know how I feel about them
And that I wish them well

Sweet harmony, go on and and blow on
Stay in perfect tune with your own familiar song
Make the world aware that you're still goin' strong
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world

Sweet harmony, yeah, yeah, go on and blow on
I believe in miracles if you can dream it, it can be done
And though a task was made for two
It can be done well by one
Go on,spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world, ooh...

Sweet harmony, ooh...
Spread your joy around the world, ooh...
Sweet harmony
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Sweet harmony, ah...
Sweet harmony, ooh...

Sweet harmony, go on and blown on
You were the prelude for the song
The village minstrels play
Though most of them have come and gone
You're still around today
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Harmony, spread your joy around the world

Keep on, sweet harmony, ooh, yeah
Go on and blow on, na, na
Sweet harmony, ooh...
To every heart and soul
You know the joy you bring
When you do your thing, ooh...
Sweet harmony, yeah
Go on and warm your heart
'Cause you know how
Don't stop now, no
Sweet harmony, harmony, oh...
Spread your joy around the world, ooh, yeah
Sweet harmony, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it...

// Will You Love Me Tomorrow? //

Now I lay me down to love you tonight
But will you feel the same in the morning light?

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Yeah, tonight the light of love is in your eyes, yeah
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Oh, can I believe the magic of your charms?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
(You don't have t say a word to let me know)
Oh, you say, you say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken, ooh...
When the night meets the morning sun?

Oh, love so beautiful
I'd like to think that you'd be mind forever

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
Oh, so tell, tell
Tell me now and I won't ask again
No, no, no, no
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

// Wanna Know My Mind //

Wanna know what I think about
When my day is beginning
Wanna know how come I'm tripping out
When my head starts to spin around

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind

Wanna know what I am inside
And if outside is a cover
Of all of the people I may display, yeah
Whether I'm one or the other

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind

Nobody else should know
Nobody but you, the joy I'm thinking
I should have told you so
But you know, you've been running some
And making it hard for me to show you
Where I'm coming from, yeah, yeah

Nobody but you should know
The joy I'm thinking, baby
But you know, you've been running some
And making it hard for me to tell you
Where I'm coming from, no

Wanna know what I think about
When lost in deep concentration
Ooh, unlock my head and check it out
You know you've got the right combination

Wanna know my hopes and aims
Wanna know my goal
Wanna know my joys and pains
Wanna know my soul

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind
Do you wanna know my mind, oh...
Wanna know my mind, ooh...

Wanna know my mind, ooh...
Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind
Wanna know my mind...

// The Family Song //

Gemini and Aquarius
Well, I'm talking 'bout
Leo the Lion and Sagittarius
What a groovy combination
Dig that foursome, yeah
Living in a four-way situation
'Til some more come

Two guys and two girls together
In one love that's strong
Singing that family song
Yeah, singing that family song

First the Twins met the Waterman
Waterman said, "Twins
I'm gonna make you mine if I can"
Then one day soon, the Lion
Raised his head and roared aloud
(Uh-huh, now)
And Waterman and Twins
Were feeling mighty, mighty proud
And by and by
The Archer let the arrow fly
(Yes, he did now)
And made four where there was three
And made sure that there would be

Two guys and two girls together
In one love that's strong, yeah
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song

Gemini and Aquarius
Well, I'm talking 'bout
Leo the Lion and Sagittarius
A groovy combination, air and fire
Of each other, they should never tire, no

Two girls and two guys together
In one love that's strong, yeah
Singing that family song
Singing that family song
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song, ooh...
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song
...

// Baby Come Close //

Turn the lights down low
Baby, come close
Put your hand in mine
Oh, please be kind

Please, darling, stay
Put your trust in me
