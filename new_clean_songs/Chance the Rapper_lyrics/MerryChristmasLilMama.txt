[Jeremih:]
Wait, kringle bells all the way
Ayy, on your heels, girl, make that shake (Shake, shake, shake)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh
And tryna tee up Christmas day
Won't you, won't you kringle bells all the way
Ayy, got them bells all on her shake (Shake, shake, shake, shake)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on the way
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes in my sleigh, ayy

(Legs up)
Hello, kitty (Hell yeah)

It's cuffing season (Hell yeah)
But you got a man (Yeah, yeah)
Tell him get (Spread up)
I'm in the spirit (Yeah, yeah)
So who's is it? (Say it now)

[Chance The Rapper (Jeremih):]
I don't play (Legs up)
See my face (Hell yeah)
Have a seat (Oh yeah)
Make a plate (Hell yeah)
She can't wait (Yeah, yeah)
Still awake (Spread up)
To open gifts (Yeah, yeah)
It's Christmas Day (Say it now)

[Jeremih (Chance The Rapper):]
Ayy, kringle bells all the way (All the way)
Ayy, on your heels, girl, make that shake (I make it shake)
Got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh (Up on my sleigh)
And tryna tee up Christmas day (On Christmas day)
Won't you, won't you kringle bells all the way? (All the way)
Ayy, got them bells all on her shake (On Christmas day)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on the way (I brought them away)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes in my sleigh

[Jeremih:]
I'll keep you close
Howlin' in snow
Call your Santa Claus
That's what Christmas for

[Jeremih (Chance The Rapper):]
Hey, I got jingle all the way (All the way)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh (I make it sleigh)
And tryna tee up Christmas Day, yeah (On Christmas Day)
And tryna tee up Christmas Day (On Christmas Day)
Tell them jingle bells all the way (Up all the way)
Ayy, bells are hangin', oh damn, they shake (I make it shake)
I got three hoes on the way (Up on the way)
And tryna tee up Christmas day (On Christmas Day)

[Jeremih:]
Just tell me, which floor should I get off?
And I'll be right there to set it off
I'll be right there to deck the halls
Either your love or none at all
And your presence is a present for me
For Christmas or just because
It's either your love or none at all
Either your love or none at all

[Hannibal Buress:]
Christmas
Oh, I love Christmas
Being obligated to buy shit for people at a certain time of the year
I buy Christmas gifts, but just, just 'cause you're supposed to
Jesus
Auto-Tune that for me
Jesus
Consumerism
Jesus' birthday
I swear to God, if you leave my raw vocals like that
We not friends anymore
Auto-Tune my shit and put them
Put them Travis Scott effects on my shit

// Stranger At The Table //

Bongo by the way

No, you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl, who you want around?
I know I'm not that nigga that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where was you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, I'ma tell you that

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

I know this sound crazy, but you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby (My Xmas at home)
You don't understand me, I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone, we should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Auntie Cam and all of them
And they act like Maury
They say, "Where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like Lena Horne in "The Wiz"
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some, "Don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me

I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby (Ah, ah, ah)
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family (Ah, ah, ah)
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

// I Shoulda Left You //

[Chance The Rapper:]
Zaytoven
IGH! What? Why you followin' me?
Where you think...?
Ain't you...? Ugh

Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

[Lud Foe:]
Niggas been hatin' since 2014
'Cause they ain't wanna see a youngin' on the big screen
This shit ain't been the same since 2015
I lost a lot of people in 2016
The Lord told me they wasn't meant for me
The hoes won't get a red cent from me
If I get locked down would you sin for me?
She ain't go for you but she went for me
Ayy, look what you done done to me
Remember when they used to make fun of me
I pull up like trucks and they run from me
Blue cheese, yeah my pockets where the hundreds be
I ain't met a bitch yet say she done with me
Bitch keep tryna show me her tongue ring
I'm a king so she honor me
I still keep a stick like a pogo
You say you gonna rob me, that's a no-no
I still get them things in for the low-low
Yeah we got more pumps than a GoLo
Long nights in the skreets like a hobo
A nigga diss on me, he a homo
He claim he don't know me, but his ho know
The rap game ain't the same since Lud Foe
Since Lud Foe

[Chance The Rapper:]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

[Jeremih:]
Fuck 2016
I'm a boss, I got sauce, now she wanna striptease
Man I made it out the hunnids, I only count blue things
I only drive big wings, all I drive is big wing
Hit the studio with you, got 'bout 20 16s
We gon' leave all the rumors back in 2016
It must suck to be you, got your girls in the Lex, peace
Baby girl say she 20, actin' like she 16
Leave that fake flexin' up in 2016
Don and Blitzen on your baby, slidin' in them Vickies
Got a donkey on you, baby, can't believe it, Ripley's
Merry Christmas, space jammin', swear I got 'bout six rings

[Chance The Rapper:]
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
G, go somewhere, would you lose my number please?
You still out tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016

You a throwback with your old ass
Talkin' 'bout, "We go back"
You need to go back
To wherever, I don't give a fuck, go 'way
Leave your attitude at the doorway
Leave your ass too at the doorway
I ain't never like your ass no way
I ain't never like your ass, I ain't never like your ass
I ain't never like your ass no way
Why your ass workin' that same old tired ass job?
They ain't fire your ass in '08?
Now I'm 'bout to show your ass
Shoulda walked by your ass
I ain't tryna find your ass no way
Got too many bodies you a throw 'way
Rest in peace to great David Bowie
Please can we get back Prince?
Please can we get back Kim?
Bo Slice, boy I swear that they gave you life
Shoulda left your ass in the pen'
Please can we get back Craig Sager?
Leave your ass at the rim
Three feet, no pressure, no press, no questions
Actually one simple question

Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you

[Jeremih:]
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left, shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// The Tragedy //

Ooh, snow is fallin'
Ooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, ooh
Ooh, snow is fallin'
Ooh, winter is callin'
Winter is callin' you, ooh, ooh

[Chance The Rapper:]
Old man, sittin' on the corner
Old man, been there for years
Old man, weepin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his
Old man weepin' in the corner
Cold again, it snowed again
Old man waitin' by the corner
Waitin' on winter again
He needs help
He needs help
He needs Heaven
He needs Heaven
Old man waitin' by the corner
Old man drinkin' by the corner
Tryna find somewhere warmer
Some place that he can get warmer tonight
Winter's coming
Winter's coming
Old man sittin' on the corner
Tryna find what's his

[Noname:]
When I was your craving and only this mattered
This jingle bell sanctified, sugared in batter
Our heathenous appetite, ever and after
Like Christmas will save us and bathe us in rapture
Mr. Happy, Mr. Matrimony
Mr. Half-A-Block-Away-From-Stony
I love you
There's something hauntin', dauntin' 'bout your presence
Casper essence, ghost of Christmas past
Phantom of unraveling his laugh
Opera, string quartet
Curtain's up, but the whole room darkened up
I know winter was callin' you
Me baby, my baby
He Chris with the Kringle in rooms filled with ladies
They lovin' his presence, a blessin' a blessin'
I'm guessin' you happy
I'm knowin' you answered
When winter was callin' you
