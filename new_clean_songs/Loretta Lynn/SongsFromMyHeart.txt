// Happy Birthday //

Well I know where you're going and who's gonna meet you there
I know how late you'll be coming home but guess who doesn't care
Tonight I'll step out too and since I won't be here
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year

My best wishes may be early but I'm not sticking around
To bake a cake for your birthday while you're out running around
She can help you celebrate may she bring you lots of cheer
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year

[Guitar]

Now I've made my mind up late second's long enough
You think I don't mean it so you're gonna call my bluff
But I'll be busy packing while you're holding her near
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year

My best wishes may be early but I'm not sticking around
To bake a cake for your birthday while you're out running around
She can help you celebrate may she bring you lots of cheer
Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy New Year

Happy birthday merry Christmas and happy, happy New Year

// When Lonely Hits Your Heart //

Here I am a doing things I said I'd never do
But that's before my baby said we're through
It was on that tragic day the hurtin' got its start
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart
I've become a fallen girl for the love of a man
The same old thing goes on and on it's more than I can stand
To him it just don't matter but it's tearing me apart
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart
[ guitar - piano ]
I spent my nights a crying while he was running round
My heart was the first place lonely found
I don't think I'll forget him I can't begin to start
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart
I've become a fallen girl...

// You've Made Me What I Am //

You say that I'm no angel oh I know it much too well
How can you look into my eyes and ask me why I failed
You know that I still love you and I let you drag me down
How can you talk about me when you've made me what I am
You've made me what I am but look who everybody blames
When you know you're the reason I hang my head in shame
Oh you tell me to forget you and to stop my hanging round
I'd be ashamed if I were you you've made me what I am
[ piano ]
You never really loved me but I found that out too late
I've tried to find the way to change my love for you to hate
You act like you don't know me when there's someone else around
How can you hold your head up when you've made me what I am
You've made me what I am...

// Once A Day //

When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone is once a day every day all day long
[ piano ]
I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away oh lucky me I'm only cryin' once a day
Once a day all day long...
Once a day every day all day long

// You're The Only Good Thing //

Are you thinking that I don't care for you
Could it be you believe that I've been untrue
Oh listen sweetheart it just cannot be
For you're the only good thing that happened to me
We've had our ups and downs like all lovers do
But you know in your heart that I worship you
So don't ever think of setting me free
For you're the only good thing that happened to me
[ steel ]
If you ever should think that I don't love you
That I'm not satisfied with the things that you do
I want you to know and please understand
There's nothing in this world worth the touch of your hand
We've had our ups and downs...

// It Just Looks That Way //

No I'm not crying it just looks that way
He thinks his leaving me will drive me mad silly boy he's the smallest hurt I've had
These ain't tears I'm standing in it rains today
No I'm not crying it just looks that way
No I'm not crying it just looks that way
I convince my heart I'm happy and make believe everything I say
He thinks he left me lonesome and hurtin' every day
Oh but I'm not crying it just looks that way
[ guitar ]
No I'm not crying...
Oh but I'm not crying it just looks that way

// I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today //

I don't believe I'll fall in love today fond memories of you stand in the way
I just can't make my heart find someone new it's always much too busy loving you
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find another in my heart and on my mind
Then I'll wake and I'll hear my poor heart say I don't believe I'll fall in love today
[ steel - piano ]
I don't believe I'll fall in love today for if I did I'm sure I wouldn't stay
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow he'd never measure up to you
Each night I pray...

// Half A Mind //

I don't love you like I used to do but I'm afraid to tell you so
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Now words to tell you just don't come to me I guess my courage is too slow
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
[ steel - piano ]
Now time may prove that you are not to blame but now the time I need to know
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Yes I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go

// Oh Lonesome Me //

Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how he set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see oh lonesome me
Well I'll bet he's not like me he's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the girls with all his charms
Oh but I still love him so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome him right back here in my arms
There must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
[ guitar ]
Well I'll bet he's not like me...
Oh lonesome me oh lonesome me

// Boy Like You //

There's a jukebox in my ear playing so loud I can hardly hear
It's tellin' a story about a boy like you
And each selection that I make tells me how my heart will break
For falling in love with a boy like you
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean
It says I probably spend my whole life feeling blue
So I'll put in one more dime and play that same song one more time
Cause I wanna hear about a boy like you
[ piano ]
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean
It says I probably spend my whole life feeling blue
I know that I should go on home but I can't stand to be alone
Cause I always dream about a boy like you
Yes I always dream about a boy like you

// When Dreams Go Out Of Style //

Last night I dreamed about you and morning brought no change
I'll spend this whole day crying with that usual thing
Right now I can't remember the last time that I smiled
But I'll stop loving you when dreams go out of style
I know you think I'm crazy you don't feel the way I do
But still I'll keep on hoping that my dreams will come true
My heart won't let me give up my thoughts keep running wild
But I'll stop loving you when dreams go out of style
[ steel ]
It's gotten so here lately I hear you call my name
Each night I wake up dreaming it's drivin' me insane
Friends tell me I'll get better but that will take awhile
I'll still be loving you when dreams go out of style
I'll still be loving you when dreams go out of style

// Wound Time Can't Erase //

Have you found since you turned me down the one that you've been searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad for you know you vowed to love me ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Tell me what can I do when you say that we are through
You've left a wound time can't erase
[ piano - guitar ]
Tell me dear are you satisfied to be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you have done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind...
