// Favorite //

Oh lie

I thought you were golden

I thought you were wise

Caught you returning

To the house you caught fire

But I know that I was your favorite

And I said Amen


Wise, found favorin' heaven

And I at your side

But I never felt sorry

For those shimmering lies

When I laid down and cried

I was faking

And I said Amen


Last night I dreamt

That I hit a deer with my car

Blood from his heart

Spilled out onto my dress and was warm

He begged me to follow

But legions of sorrow defied me


Oh lie

I thought you were golden

I thought you were wise

When I caught you returning

To the house you caught fire

But I know that I'm your favorite

And I said "Amen"

Oh favorite

And I said Amen

// Blacklisted //

Fast train

Where do your passengers wait

What's at the heart of your engine's rage


To what smooth place at the end of the line

With crackling fires and quiet plains

Do the trees bend down

Fold their limbs round you

Welcome home faithful one

We forgive you


Slow down fast train

Slow down fast train

Take me with you

// If You Knew //

And if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you
Well you're just another puppet, she's not even keeping score
And the lazy way she cheats you leaves me cold
She'll laugh about you, my best friend, but you don't know

'Cause if you knew what I know
You wouldn't go to see her
And least of all believe her when she says that she wants you

She spends her daddy's money
And she drives her daddy's car
And what's crazy is the way you think that's style
And all the while my heart is breaking
You're not even on her mind 

'Cause if you knew what I know
Babe you wouldn't leave me
You wouldn't turn away from my love it's 
what you said that you believed in

I say this as your friend
You'll be the poor boy in the end

// Soulful Shade Of Blue //

Dressmaker, dressmaker,

I'm singing at the hall next saturday night and he'll be there.

He's been gone for so long, I want him back again,

Make me the sweetest dress you can.


Make it a soulful shade of blue with a ribbon at the hem,

A ribbon white for loyalty to show that I remember when

A soulful shade of blue looked into my eyes

And tell him I want him back again


Dressmaker, dressmaker, don't make it loud or bright, just make it a sweet and gentle style

Then maybe he'll remember me it was not so long ago I'll miss his sweet and gentle smile


Make it a soulful shade of blue with a ribbon at the hem,

A ribbon white for loyalty to show that I remember when

A soulful shade of blue looked into my eyes

And tell him I want him back again


Make it a soulful shade of blue

// Hex //

When you hear me calling your name in the night

Do you run to your window thinking a coyote might

Be howling

When you hear me knocking at your door again

Do you tell yourself it's only the wind

That's blowing

When you watch the sun sink down in the west

Do you tell yourself that the heart in your chest

Is still beating


Will you know or must I tell you

This is my lover's spell you have fallen into

My dear

My voice is all you'll hear

Only the sound of my heart pounding, darling

You took my heart

Cast it aside

Laughed when I cried

Like it was just no big deal

And here all alone in the dark

I know just how you feel


When you feel my fingers touch your skin again

Do you tell yourself there's just no use

In crying

When the stars in the sky begin to fade

Do you tell yourself, don't be afraid

It's just the night

That's dying


Will you know or must I tell you

This is my lover's spell you have fallen into, my dear

My voice is all you'll hear

Only the sound of my heart pounding, darling

// Train From Kansas City //

Baby, baby, please believe me

I would never never do anything to hurt you

Baby, baby, please believe me

I would never never do anything to you to make you blue

But yesterday I got this letter

From the boy I loved before I ever knew you

Before I even knew you


And the train from Kansas city is coming into town.

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around.


Baby, baby, please believe me

Nothing in this world would tear us apart

We'll never, never part

So wait right here and I will hurry

I'll be back in the time it takes to break a heart

I gotta break his heart


'Cause the train from Kansas city is coming into town

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around


No, I never answered his letter

I just couldn't tell him that way

No, I never answered his letter

I just didn't know what to say

Now I'm going down to the station

I'll be there at ten after two

I'll show him the ring on my finger

I don't what else I can do


The train from Kansas city is coming into town

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around


Here comes the train

// The Tigers Have Spoken //

They shot the tiger on his chain

In a field behind the cages

He walked in circles 'til he was crazy

And he lived that way forever

And he lived that way beside them,

Separate from the other tigers

He did not know another tiger


They shot the tiger on his chain

In a field behind the cages

He walked in circles 'til he was crazy

And he lived that way forever

And he lived that way forever

Just as long as he could remember

If he'd wanted to remember


It was the last time he had felt alive

When he saw that brown-haired lady

She fed him with a bottle as a baby

And he recalled her face and smile

They shot that tiger on his chain


They shot the tiger on his chain

They shot the tiger on his chain

They shot the tiger on his chain

They shot the tiger on his chain

// Loretta //

When I talk to Loretta

Oh, boots, socks and sweater

Well she hugs me sweet and low

And it's never let me go

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one


Well I heard her on the wire

Oh Sweet Loretta, child

She hugs me sweet and low

And it's never let me go

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one


When I talk to Loretta

When I talk about the feeling

She hugs me sweet and low

And it's never let me go

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

When I talk to Loretta, she makes me feel like number one

Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight


When I talk to Loretta

When I talk to Loretta

She make me, she make me, she make me

Make me, make me, make me feel like number one

// Rated X //

Well if you've been a married woman and things didn't seem to work out

Well Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free but you're gonna be talked about

Everybody knows that you've loved once, and they think you'll love again

You can't have a male friend if you're a has been, or a woman, rated X


And if you're rated X you're some kind of gold even men turning silver try to make

But I think it's wrong to judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake

And when your best friend's husband says to you you've sure started lookin' good

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X


Well nobody knows where you're goin' but they sure know where you've been,

All their thinking of is your experience of love, all their minds eat up with sin

The women all look at you like you're bad and the men all hope you are

But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar of a woman rated X


Well if you're rated X you're some kind of gold even men turning silver try to make

But I think it's wrong to judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake

And when your best friend's husband says to you, you've sure started looking good

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X

// This Little Light //

This little light of mine

I'm going to let it shine

This little light of mine

I'm going to let it shine

This little light of mine

I'm going to let it shine

Every day, every day

Every day, every day

Gonna let my little light shine


Jesus gave me light

I'm going to let it shine

Jesus gave me light

I'm going to let it shine

Jesus gave me light

I'm going to let it shine

Every day, every day

Every day, every day

Gonna let my little light shine...

// Wayfaring Stranger //

I am a poor wayfaring stranger

A-traveling thru this world below

But there's no sickness, toil, or danger

In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my Father

I'm going there no more to roam

I'm just a-going over Jordan

I'm just a-going over home


I am a poor wayfaring stranger

A-traveling thru this world below

But there's no sickness, toil, or danger

In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my mother

She said she'd meet me when I come

I'm just a-going over Jordan

I'm just a-going over home

I'm just a-going over home

I'm just a-going over home

// Tigers Are Noble //

[Neko:]

This is a sad song, about tigers.

[Carolyn:]

Let's champion the tigers.

[Neko:]

Let's champion the tiger 'cause.

You know, I think that maybe I wrote this song for many reasons

But I was telling them earlier, I was in a cab in Toronto the other day

And the CBC was on and they were talking to a lady

Who specializes in animal husbandry

And she takes care of the tigers at The Toronto Zoo.

And they said "Well do you ever reintroduce the tigers?"

And she goes "Well, no, because their habitat can't sustain them."

And immediately I thought to myself

'There's so many extra children, we could just feed the children, to these tigers.'

We don't need them. We're not doing anything with them.

Tigers are, tigers are...

[Carolyn:]

Noble!

[Male voice:]

Hungry!

[Neko:]

Noble, and sleek

Children are loud and messy

I was one of those children

If I were to become tiger food

It would've been more noble than

[Carolyn:]

Heavy!

[Neko:]

Anyway

Probably ruined the song for you now

But we'll still play it for you anyway
