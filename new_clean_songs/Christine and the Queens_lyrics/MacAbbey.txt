// Cripple //

I miss my Motus to tell me how
I miss Mathusalem to tell me why
I miss them for being white and red
I miss them for all the tears they shed

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple

I miss prothesis and mended souls
How they trample on beauty with those singin' thoughts
I'm in for shady insomnia
When they said "je suis plus folle que toi!"

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple

They love and let down
They love and let down
They love and let down
They love and let down

Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple
Cause I actually do enjoy being a cripple

// Amazoniaque //

Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama

Mes nuits d'insomnie j'me perds dans les forêts d'Amazonie
Dans tes ch'veux, tes bras qui m'enserrent, c'est bien là que j'me perds
Les indiens d'Amazonie attrapent au coeur des maladies
Contagion express envoyée par courrier civilisé

Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama

Paradis zéro en Amazonie, j'me balade à minuit
L'ibis était rouge, banlieue nord, je bois un verre dans un bouge
Du côté d'la zone bleue, sur les trottoirs je zone, c'est là ma zone
Carrefour et j'me perds, le cafard, l'feu est vert sur les boulevards

Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama

Mes nuits d'insomnie j'me perds dans les forêts d'Amazonie
Trous noirs de l'espace, les avions de chasse ont disparu
Mes nuits d'insomnie j'me perds dans les forêts d'Amazonie
En haut de tes cuisses, une ombre cicatrice, Amazonie

Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama
Amazoniaque, Ama

// Safe And Holy //

Motus takes out all the drags for dancin'
With the rain they look disgusting
I'm feeling nauseous as they hold my hand
I've been crouching since the morning
But what I have left baby
What gave me hope lately
Are weathering fires when I'm dancing
Now I've got to have some patience
With the rhythm then you get strong
Fever asks for undisclosed believes
Your arms wide open can't be wrong
Cause what I have left baby
What gave me hope lately
Are heavy collapses when I'm dancing

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame,
To swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown childs of my own
My desires

My desires…
As I dance I'm safe and holy
As I dance I'm safe and holy

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame,
To swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown childs of my own
My desires

// Drifter //

[Christine:]
You sent all your teeth to a jeweller
And broke them whistlers
They are asunder
Some of them could say you lost your temper
In the bloomed colours
There could be an answer

[The Queens:]
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie

[Christine:]
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!

A volcano died as you shily spoke
Now follow its smoke
Now follow its smoke

What lies ahead is an empty kingdom
Where there can be no question
There can be no love

[The Queens:]
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie
Callin' Cee Cee Lee Cee Cee Lyles Cee Cee lie lie lie

[Christine:]
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
You're a drifter!
