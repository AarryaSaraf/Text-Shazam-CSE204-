Album: TheRightCombinationBurningTheMidnightOil

// More Than Words Can Tell //

When you're rocking back and forth there by the window
And the sun shines through the silver in your hair
I'll think of all the years we've spent together
And of all the good and bad times we've shared

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each things we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell

When the golden years have slowly come upon us
And our children have all married off and gone
You know, sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
And I love you more as each day passes on

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
And each day as we grow closer to God's calling
I pray He'll call us at the same time
There to dwell

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each things we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell
Yes, I love you more than words could ever tell

// The Right Combination //

I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on

There'll be times when you may doubt my reasons
But I know your love will always make a way
And I know that there'll be times
When we'll have heartaches
But it won't worry us cause love is just that way

I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on

Some folks spend a lifetime searching for the right one
And they'll grasp at anyone of love's sensations
But you and I will search the most for we have found (yes, we have honey)
You and I have found the right combination

I believe we have the right combination
Our love and happiness both seem so strong
I believe we have a firm foundation
That our love can build and last forever on

// I've Been This Way Too Long //

Hmm (oh ain't he cute) ah

Well, I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No, and I don't like to sweep my floors if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am, I've been this way too long

I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time tryin' 'cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am, I've been this way too long

Oh, and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No, and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
'Cause you can't change the way I am, I've been this way too long

Well, I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should, you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am, I've been this way too long

I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time tryin' 'cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am, I've been this way too long

Oh, as far as I can remember back, you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be, honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade, I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh, that's real cute you're makin' up stuff now)

// In Each Love Some Pain Must Fall //

Darling, it's not really over, it just seems to be
Darling, I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling, don't you know in each love some pain must fall

These tiny drops of pain that's fallen down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling, don't you know in each love some pain must fall

In each love some pain must fall
That doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone
Everything will be alright again
And the hurt that seems so big now
Tomorrow will seem small
Darling, don't you know in each love some pain must fall

In each love some pain must fall
That doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone
Everything will be alright again
And the hurt that seems so big now
Tomorrow will seem small
Darling, don't you know in each love some pain must fall

// Her And The Car And The Mobile Home //

Well, my wife and I were happy in our trailer
But she didn't dig my running around all night
Well, I warned you a couple times 'bout leaving
Oh, but you just laughed and took it kinda light

Well, I shoulda paid attention to her warning
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
'Cause when I come home about sun up this morning
Well, I detected something mighty strange

Her and the car and the mobile home are gone, boys
I was taking off while you was a-carrying on
Now things are really shot, I came home to an empty lot
Yeah, me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yes, her and the car and the mobile home was gone

Well, the neighbors all around me were a-laughing
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Uh, not to mention taking home and all

Well, talk about somebody bewildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found little consolation in my wardrobe
That you left scattered on the patio

Her and the car and the mobile home are gone, boys
I was taking off while you was a-carrying on
Now things are really shot, I came home to an empty lot
Yeah, me and the car and the mobile home was gone, gone
Yes, her and the car and the mobile home was gone

Yeah, they was gone along with everything else
Except a few old western suits she left scattered there on the patio
And they had mud all over 'em where she stomped around on 'em
Stepped on them wagon wheels, busted the spokes out
You know that real nice lavender suit?
One that she said I looked good in, looked like Tom Jones
That's it hanging over in that tree
She took that piece of chalk and wrote across the front of the coat
Have a good time, darling
You know, when you're hot, you're hot

// Burning The Midnight Oil //

Here we sit lookin' at each other
Seems we're at a loss of what to say
Ties bind us both two someone else
We don't want to hurt but we must break away

And tonight I'll sit home a' thinkin'
And tonight I'll sit home a' drinkin'
We both live in separate homes
Where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late, burnin' the midnight oil

Tomorrow, we'll meet here in this same place
With love and desire that just won't wait
In each others' arms we'll dream for a little while
Then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild

And tonight again I'll sit home a' thinkin'
And tonight again I'll sit home a' drinkin'
We both live in separate homes
Where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late, burnin' the midnight oil

// Somewhere Along The Way //

Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way, mmm

Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh, and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
'Cause once love has died it won't ever live again

Somewhere along the way we stumbled and oh, and we fell
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way, mhm

// On And On //

How long will you love me?
How long will you stay by my side?
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while?
From now on yes, on and on

If you will love and stand by me
I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be
From now on yes, on and on

From now on yes, on and on
From now on, yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on, on and on

I'll stand by you right or wrong
Then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song
I need you from now on

Like the rose loves a vine
Like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine
From now on, and on and on

From now on yes, on and on
From now on, yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on, on and on
From now on, on and on

// Through Thick And Thin //

The road of love is steep it's a hard climb all the way
To stay in love we must keep working at it every day
We have our ups and downs but we take it with a grin
'Cause we've promised to stick together through thick and thin

We don't always see eye to eye and we don't always agree
But every day we both try to make each other happy
And if we have a quarrel we'll just kiss and try again
'Cause we've promised to stick together through thick and thin

We've promised to stick together that's what we're gonna do
We won't let our love grow old we're gonna keep it new
Hard times may hit us maybe just around the bend
But we've promised to stick together through thick and thin

// The Fog Has Lifted //

I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you

I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside

I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you

Now there's the sunshine again
And there's the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted, what a beautiful view, mmm
