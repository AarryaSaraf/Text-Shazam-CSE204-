Album: JustToSatisfyYou

// Lonely Weekends //

Well, I make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Since you left me
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends.

Said you'd be true to me
You said our love's never gonna die
Said you'd be true to me
But baby you didn't even try.

I'll make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends.

[Instrumental]

You said you'd be true to me
You said our love's never gonna die
Said you'd be true to me
But baby you didn't even try.

I'll make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends.

Oh, those lonely weekends.
Oh, those lonely weekends...

// Sing The Blues To Daddy //

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

I hear that your new romance has faded
Just the way ours did sometime ago
I've lost count of all the times I've waited
For you to tell me that you've missed me so.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
When things don't work out the way you planned
Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

Like a child that's found a brand new plaything
Each one is more fun than those before
But there's a faithful one who's always waiting
To be picked up and kicked around once more.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands...

// Change My Mind //

If I should get a look of leavin' in my eyes
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind
If I ever seem too restless or dissatisfied
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind.

Don't let me seperate your love from mine
Don't let me leave you I might get the urge some time
If I do you'll know what to do to keep me by your side
Put your arms round me baby and change my mind.

[Instrumental]

If the gay life of the barrooms beckons me at night
Put your arms round me baby and change my mind
And if a new love ever tempts me that I should search to find
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind.

Put your arms round me woman and change my mind...

// Farewell Party //

When the last breath of life is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather 'round my farewell party
Please won't you pretend you love me?

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I'll go
And leave you in this old world alone
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party
Or will you be glad when I'm gone?

Don't be angry with me a wanting to keep you
Till my life in this old world is done and through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you.

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I'll go
And leave you in this old world alone
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party
Or will you be glad when I'm gone?...

// Rings Of Gold //

I remember when you said
With this ring I Thee wed
Now you've gone betrayed my trust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Tears can't wash away the sin
Love that's dead can't live again
Knowing there's no hope for us
Turns these rings of gold to rust.

Love before was clean and pure
Never more can I be sure
You will not betray my trust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Plans we made just yesterday
Sands of time have chipped away
Now they've crumbled into dust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Rings of gold have turned to rust...

// Alone //

Isn't there anyone
Who'll take me like I am
Someone who's willing
To take the blue in man.

Someone that's pleased enough
With himself to let me be
Someone who'd love me
And try to understand my needs.

No, I guess there isn't
And there's no place
I can go I guess
I'm destined to be alone.

Good thing that somewhere
In this world there'll be
Someone who wouldn't
Always try to change me.

Someone not trying to prove
Their way is right
Take a flame that's burnin'
And just put out the light.

No I guess there isn't
And there's no place
I can go I guess
I'm destined to be alone...

// I Lost Me //

You tear me down a hundred times a day
I've cried enough to wash the world away
I've tried so hard to be what you've wanted me to be
Till somewhere along the way I lost me.

To give and keep on giving I have learned
There's no way but yours where you're concerned
I tried till finally I lost my own identity
And somewhere along the way I lost me.

Somewhere along the way I lost the man I used to be
A man who smiled, enjoyed life, loved you with all of me
You'd never once considered how I felt
So go ahead and live my life yourself.

I've tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be
Somewhere along the way I lost me.

Somewhere along the way I lost me...

// I've Been Needing Someone Like You //

I just came in to drown some sorrow
I'll be leavin' town tomorrow
Just another bum that's passin' through
Hitchin' rides when I ain't walkin' 
Ain't had time to do no talkin'
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

Say my eyes are filled with sadness
Well, they once were filled with gladness
Once I loved someone I thought was true
But I found her with another
Since that day there's been no other
And woman I've been needin' someone like you.

[Instrumental]

Back then my better judgement failed me
Tried to kill him and they jailed me
And though that happened back in '62
Can't hold the job 'cause no one wants me
With the past like mine that haunts me
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

The luck of love and conversation
Kills the man like snow starvation
Five long years that's all that I've gone through
Now you say that's all behind me
It was meant for you to find me
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

Yes, woman I've been needin' someone like you...

// For The Kids //

You work like a slave for the kids
And I'd go to my grave for the kids
But we watched our love fade as we suffered that state
With this bargain we made for the kids.

Divorce is a curse for the kids
But this intention's much worse for the kids
Yes, they're now old enough and they made the strongest stuff
Still it's gonna be rough for the kids.

These teardrops that fall for the kids
You know they're really not all for the kids
But I know you don't care and the only love there
Is the love that'd be shared for the kids.

Find a new love you should for the kids
And I hope that he's good for the kids
And though I'm now out of sight if he don't treat them right
I'll be right back and I'll fight for the kids.

But I see you don't care the home that we shared
All our hopes and our prayers for the kids...

// I Got You //

Don't get no attention from the people on street
They don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be.

But I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need.

[Instrumental]

Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford
People all around us with their noses in the air
They walk right on by us just like we're not even there.

But I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need.

[Instrumental]

I got you and you got me
And if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need.

[Instrumental]

I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we will ever need...

// Straighten My Mind //

A tiger always walks at night
And marks his prey while everything's still
He waits until it's unaware
And then he strikes and makes his kill.

That's the way you've done me girl
You never let me be
Couldn't feel the way I felt
So you'd tried to punish me.

Baby it's time to straighten my mind.

A spider's always busy spinning webs
That no one can get through
Somehow that spider always has
Reminded me babe of you.

You took the love I gave you
But you'll never let it live
That's the hang of girl
You know how to take but not to give.

Baby it's time to straighten my mind.

[Instrumental]

You've kept me like a river
Always clinging to the ground
I've got to get away from you
Before I sink and drown.

Baby it's time to straighten my mind...
