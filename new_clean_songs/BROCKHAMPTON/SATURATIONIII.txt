Me llamo Roberto y me gusta bailar

[Kevin Abstract:]
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow up like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow up like a real ass bitch

[Kevin Abstract:]
Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection

Been a wrong, you can change the song, hun

[Matt Champion:]
Who got me riled up?

[Joba:]

Real shit, feelin' saturated
Real love, this might fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I got ya
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Real love, this might fuck the haters

[Merlyn Wood:]
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Dom McLennon:]
They be like "what the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the pharaoh when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, let it in and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that's zoom if you just assume

[Kevin Abstract:]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Dom McLennon (Merlyn Wood):]
Merlyn!

[Joba:]
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

[Dom McLennon:]
Sun sets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
So we were too caught up in transforming

[Kevin Abstract:]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to

[Matt Champion:]
Lucky days, I'm feelin' the force
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, uh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two litre, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hear that running back

[Merlyn Wood:]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft shell tacos
Right now, it's panties and ramen noodles
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter
Stamina, stamina!
I used to be holding the camera
Head through the glass, throw your window up
Start praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang but I feel like Santana
Sweet-talkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano...
Made her my wife-a
She can't eat 'cause she's so Bella
Confused erection
Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless

[Kevin Abstract:]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, damn the ones you talking to

[Kevin Abstract:]
When I imagine myself on acid
I take steps backwards if time comes to lap itself
Being dazzled by the round of silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't-don't-don't-don't let life pass yourself
When I imagine myself on acid
I take steps backwards if time comes to lap itself
Being dazzled by the round of silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't-don't-don't-don't let life pass yourself

I could've got a job at McDonald's, but I like curly fries
That's a metaphor for my life, and I like taller guys
Could've got a deal if I wanted, but I like ownership
And I like making shit, and I like selling it

[Dom McLennon:]
Could've peaked when I was in high school but I had bigger plans
Could've took the time out my to find you but you ain't understand
You gotta leave for them to find you
Cause what would you demand?
When everyone out to define you without a circumstance

[Kevin Abstract:]
Anybody got Harry Styles' phone number?
Okay, I called him and they said I got the wrong number
I was trying to be popular when I was younger, dreaming of better days
I don't see my mom no more remind me of bad weather days

[Ameer Vann:]
If you got a problem with me, try some other guy
I let you know I'm a dog, I ate the cat alive
But really though, I'm alone 'cause I don't stick around
And yes, I know it's my fault, so put your finger down

[Matt Champion:]
I would keep this shit pent up if it weren't for my mom
If it weren't for the job, yeah I know it's a lot
Guess it's not every month
Should've opened up my mouth more, show them what my fist for
Let 'em get a fistful, caught up in the lust man
Bred from the legs of straight killers on west end
Black eyes, bloody sheets, damn where yo' fist at?
You should get a new crown, maybe some more things

[Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood:]
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild for me

[Kevin Abstract:]
Baby, I been trippin' off, go tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off, go tie me up and send 'em off
I been on mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Block me in your cellular, won't elevate again

[Joba:]
I'm a shit head son, and I'm bad at growing up
I'm a shit head son, and I'm bad at growing up
My life ain't been the same, since my dog died, since my girl left
I quit drinking and drugging and still can't get ahead
Been at a loss for words
It seems I'm destined to fall apart when I'm depressed
It's all a test, scream at god from my bedside
I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking I smoke a pack a day
And I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland
I was hardly in it, most the time I'm hidden
Anxious and patient and always wanting something different
I hate the way I'm feeling, I'm sick of chasing feelings

[Kevin Abstract:]
Baby, I been trippin' off, go tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Block me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off, go tie me up and send 'em off
I been on mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Block me in your cellular, won't elevate again

// LIQUID //

[Ameer Vann:]
I grew up all alone
My mom and dad fighting
I moved around a lot
I did a lot of fighting
I met my friend Ian
I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writing

[Dom McLennon (Kevin Abstract):]
Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles
Victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance
(I moved to California Started getting paid) {look what you bought}
Shit's already boring

[Merlyn Wood:]
Dance to the money like a high fifth
Fuck a pipe dream man
Had to sing when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit
It was hot shit
Back when niggas looking for the Loch Ness

[Matt Champion:]
Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes
Make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets
So my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro
Car full of Castrol
[Dom McLennon:]
See the sunset when I backstroke
Can't swim but I could act though

[Kevin Abstract:]
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends man
Imagine having no friends man

// CINEMA 1 //

[Robert Ontenient:]
Me la pasé mejor que nunca aquí, a pesar de que cometí algunos errores
Pólvora y accidentes
La navidad nunca es el mejor momento para mí
¡Ah Dios, cómo extraño a mi familia!
Haces algo y me fijo en los aviones que sobrevuelan mi casa
Enciendo un cigarillo y miro al suelo
Manteniendo mi cabeza baja por los próximos días
Con mis zapatos atados
Pero bueno
Casi terminamos muchachos, casi terminamos

// STUPID //

[Merlyn Wood]
Merlyn, hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick and move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection

[Ameer Vann (Matt Champion)]
I'm a black man with a deadly weapon
(What drug reference, huh?)
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still I'm suffocating

[Matt Champion:]
Carnival, my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ay, ay
Daddy cracking red drum, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me

[Kevin Abstract (Merlyn Wood):]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)

[Dom McLennon:]
White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant, when you do the most it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices

[Kevin Abstract:]
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, with ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit so Billy 'bout to air 'em out

[Kevin Abstract (Merlyn Wood):]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it

[Ryan Beatty:]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Matt Champion:]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me "Time's up", let the water run, let my body run

[Ryan Beatty:]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

[Merlyn Wood:]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die during sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimming
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Prick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Ameer Vann:]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleeping with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinking deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Dom McLennon:]
They said "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Ryan Beatty:]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
(Why?)

[Joba:]
Everything I have is a mirror
And everywhere I stand isn't solid ground
People don't make sense to me anymore
I'm hiding out, again
Tryna figure it out
I'm tryna figure it out
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out

[Kevin Abstract:]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Bearface:]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly raise your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why
(Why?)

// ALASKA //

[Ameer Vann:]
I used to work for people, I made a couple hundred dollars
Wasn't worth it even, I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up the bill collectors, "leave my fuckin' family 'lone"
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon

[Kevin Abstract:]
Young K.A., never quit your day job
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the, hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up and make stuff, uh
These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talkin' shit, we bring that work right to your lap
I love my niggas like white people love rap
We make this shit, you'll probably never say I'm trap again

[Joba:]
Walk through doors all my life (just to close them)
Torn down walls all my life (is to the other side)
(Uh) Feelin' the brand new feeling, feelin' the brand new feeling
(Uh) Feelin' the brand new feeling, feelin' the brand new feeling
(Uh) New feeling, had a new feeling, brand new feeling
(Uh) New feeling, had a new feeling, brand new, brand new

[Kevin Abstract:]
Back then when I was hustling, ain't get no love from them (uh)
I paid my own bills and came up with the illest shit (uh)
I was tryna find a way to get my family out of it (uh)
Spent my days in basements tryna write a motherfuckin' hit
Nowadays he's stumbling, they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, I set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'

[Matt Champion:]
I don't do what they say, it's unorthodoxed
Like bears sharing the porridge, just out with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no shares, need to call his parents
So fuck what I'm doing and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Give my head rub, my fingers are fuckin' hair models
Middle finger, fuck the air up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five
Dropped out, a lone star
Booked flight from lone star
Was working a couple jobs and quit, became a star

// HOTTIE //

[Kevin Abstract:]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Dom McLennon:]
They say "what you contribute to my consciousness?"
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent if it helped you round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break, what's monotonous

[Joba:]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the A track, I stole from my grandmama

[Merlyn Wood:]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic 
But instead I'm always bad, man
No rappin', that is my girlfriend
Every toe is like a cabbage
Just kidding, I love you assholes

[Kevin Abstract:]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up

If you thinkin' on me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Joba {Matt Champion}:]
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know where the party at}
(I just wanna know, know) {24/7 thinkin' 'bout you}
(I just wanna know, know) {I just wanna know when we leavin', boo?}

[Robert Ontenient:]
No quiero beber agua hoy
No quiero caminar por el vecindario hoy y ver cuán perfecto es el mundo
No quiero hablar con nadie
Solo quiero pararme enfrente de mi casa y ver como se hunde en mis llamas
Ojalá pudiera pedirle a mis amigos que se salgan afuera
Ojala pudiera haberlos salvado, uno por uno
Pero todo se ha ido
Me pregunto amenudamente si yo seré el proximo
Summer, lo siento

[SISTER]

[Merlyn Wood:]
Drink, got the alcopop with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Joba:]
I've got [*beep*] but she would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counselling, flippin' off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilisers but when I came off 'em I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
They called the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Robert Ontenient:]
"Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir asíendo esto ojalá pudiera rendir me pero tengo seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos"

[Kevin Abstract:]
I find myself gettin' better by the fuckin' minute
Number one, my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's dropped out wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head or in a vision
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just turn into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kiss and then before them bitches, run away

Get your man, get your man all up off me
Back again, 100 bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

This for all my bro niggas, this for all them drugs, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Matt Champion:]
I see you peekin' through bushes and tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us
Boomin' like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust baby I'll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk bitch still sitting on your ass
Waiting for a handout
Giving nothin' put your hands down
Ooh yeah, this for the culture
Ooh yeah, this important
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep ya mouth where the money at

[Dom Mclennon:]
Yellow lights on my dashboard, red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset, but all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight, but I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up, I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard, red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset, but all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight, but lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up, I'm struggling while on the move now

[NATION]

[Kevin Abstract:]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga lips
I look in the closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanted to treat my pack right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Ameer Vann:]
I hate the quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me: Nigga
I fight, I got suspended
My teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second guessing my decisions, black bodies come up missing

[Kevin Abstract:]
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble

[Dom McLennon:]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag till my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing the things always brushed off
Had my Father tell me I was just off
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived and at what cost?
All alone in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the eyes of the law I'm a problem
In the eyes of blogs I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world I'm an icon
In the eyes of my own I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs I'm paycheck
In the eyes of the world I'm an icon
In the eyes that I own I ain't start yet

[Kevin Abstract:]
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble
I feel like all my days are coming to rubble

[Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto, ye este es el fin de una era
Muchas gracia a todos

[Kevin Abstract:]
I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (no, no, no)
Keep 'em right there, oh you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head

[Dom McLennon:]
I wanna love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay when it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin' where you went through the chop
I need this fear of being with everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours and shit
Not enough drugs to believe, not enough him and the kid
I'm feeling hundred an hour so I been ignoring this dick
I'm seeing through what I want to recognise who is there

[Matt Champion:]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Come and tap down by the seaside
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See the road sign on the 45
Only on me by the borderline
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it go

You always sell your own for everything you own
I know it's not used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Come and tap down by the seaside
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// STAINS //

[Ameer Vann:]
I spent like a year and a half on the greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over

[Ashlan Grey:]
Y'all motherfuckers made 3 albums
Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off

[Matt Champion:]
Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like
"Where y'all get it from?"
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up
Talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'till the sun up (ay)
Hopefully get our funds up (ay)
And if I didn't know y'all
Maybe I would have a desk job
Ticking 'till I off myself
Used to drive around for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Used to get paid by the hour (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (yeah)
Used to drive around for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Circle round the block for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (yeah)

[Joba:]
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby

[Dom McLennon:]
Spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I've been tryna avoid from before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle but I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's, crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself
Goddamn

[Joba:]
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute
I'll be on it in it baby

[Robert Ontenient:]
Padre Celestial
Soy tu humilde servidor
Te presento mi necesidad de esperanza
Hay momentos en que me siento impotente
Hay momentos en que me siento débil
Rezo por Esperanza
Necesito esperanza para un futuro mejor
Necesito esperanza para una vida mejor
Necesito esperanza para amor y amabilidad
Algunos dicen que el cielo se hace mas oscuro justo antes de la luz
Rezo que esto sea cierto
Ya que todo parece oscuro
Necesito tu luz señor, en cada sentido
Rezo para ser llenado con tu luz de cabeza a pies
Para disfrutar de tu gloria y saber que todo esta bien en el mundo
Como has planeado, y como quieres que sea
Ayúdame a caminar en tu luz, y vivir mi vida en fe y gloria
En tu nombre rezo
Amen

[EVANIE]

[Bearface:]
Evanie
Did you die to care since you were seventeen?
How's he holding on, Evanie?
Do you cling to him like you would on to me?
But he needs you more than I, Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels, Evanie
Every chance you take you make me want to flee
Can't you see?

You should move on
So don't be found
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And flee to the night
Shoots to the sky
Take what you see and
You're keeping me less than lost
'Til you find it in yourself

[TEAM]

[Kevin Abstract:]
Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
Cause my president was black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola

[Ameer Vann:]
(Gimme that mic)
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits
Ain't no, ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up

[Kevin Abstract:]
They throw me in the crowd
And tell me boy I lose that smile
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had

[Ameer Vann:]
I raise my black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fuckin' locks
I lose my fuckin' strength, fuck

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm running out of sense
My life been feelin' tense
I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on airplane mode cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence

[Matt Champion:]
I hope this holy water burn me 'cause
I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day
Let summer light the way
Nude along the banister
Kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my wranglers
I am another caliber

[Bearface:]
Ooh, yeah
Soon, soon
No, no, no, no, no, no
