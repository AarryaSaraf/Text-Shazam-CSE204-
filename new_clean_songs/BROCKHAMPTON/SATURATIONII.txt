[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto
Y acabamos de robar un banco

[Kevin Abstract:]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit, when he let go of that shit
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas?, He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar

Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Merlyn Wood:]
Cash don't mean shit (shit)
Cried my last tears, bitch
Cashed my last check (check)
Cash don't mean shit (shit)
Cash don't mean shit (shit)
Cried my last tears, bitch
Cashed my last check (check)
Cash don't mean shit (shit)

[Ameer Vann:]
Call me king of the niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said let there be light, on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas, and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams, 'till they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big ass truck, I tell 'em get out the way
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

[Dom McLennon:]
How I'm gon' move at your pace?, I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together?, I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back, and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Kevin Abstract:]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Matt Champion:]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swervin' like a donut
Off, off, off, off, swervin' like a donut

[Kevin Abstract (Joba):]
Nigga whaaaat
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, if you want to)
Nigga whaaaat
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, if you want to)
Nigga whaaaat
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, if you want to)
Nigga whaaaat
Y-Yo

// QUEER //

[Matt Champion:]
Skinny boy, skinny boy
Where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work
Eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop
Ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot
'Cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls
They come running to our place so
I could do without
I could move without
I could do myself
I get in a rut
I feel depressed
I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Merlyn Wood:]
First off fuck Dolce & Gabbana
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my father
Put that on me auntie and me mama
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana
I came back again
With the platinum
To the continent
I came back again
I came back again
With the platinum
To the continent
I came back again

[Matt Champion (Kevin Abstract):]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side

[Dom McLennon:]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama I'd be back
Just gotta kill another mission
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make up for the billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window
Smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh, what a, oh, what a, oh
How appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing
I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy
Universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing
Something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents
Might give you sclerosis
Spaceship doing donuts
It's written I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Matt Champion (Kevin Abstract):]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (watchin' me baby)
[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side

[Ameer Vann:]
Bar baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me li'l nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same
Just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running outta patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested
All I get is checks now

[Ryan Beatty:]
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side
Where we'll go is far away
I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here
Right next to my side

[Kevin Abstract:]
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down

Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice but to whom I decide?
Life always better keep it two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We bein' red eye
Black man with some white guys
Keep your head up with that fourty
And at the appropriate time
They ask a question, like
"Didn't you perform at my best friend's birthday party
With your friends"
Go crazy, just bring the shawty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair
Makin' out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kick me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga
See this long hair
See these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
And the fuck
Did I land a fuckin' TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West
And I ain't met him yet

La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down

[Matt Champion:]
Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me cause it's a holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong
Bet I get along
Make some comma [s], come on, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, put a night like (night like/life) dancing on a [?]
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter
I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the volvo
Damn. Shouldn't my life?
Hmmmmmmm...
Sorry, do it all here

[Kevin Abstract:]
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not

I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down

[Ameer Vann:]
I'm moon-walking on the sun, hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandanna, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
LA turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm living different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Dom McLennon:]
I just wanna finally fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playing my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where the bus sit
Cry nigga [?] a fucking kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse she couldn't miss that
Putting my appearance where my chips at

[Kevin Abstract:]
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all probably fraud
I think that my brain is fried
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
Do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around
Only few, I'm holding down

[Joba:]
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
(La-de-da-de-da-de-da, do-walla, do-walla)
(La-de-da-de-da-de-da, do-walla, do-walla)
La-de-da-de-da-de-da
(La-de-da-de-da-de-da, do-walla, do-walla)
(La-de-da-de-da-de-da, do-walla, do-walla)

// TEETH //

[Ameer Vann:]
I done been in trouble, 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me, but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children
And the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond ain't no luck or suprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the South Side with xan-bars and gun play
Niggas on that 'some day'
If you shooting for the stars you only headed one way

// SCENE 1 //

[Robert Ontenient:]
No soy como los demás
No hago cosas solamente para divertirme
Siento como si en los últimos meses hubiera estado sentado en ese bowl gigante de cereal, el mismo que solíamos comer de jóvenes
Siento como si estuviera flotando en la leche, medio ahogándome
Puedo olerla en mi ropa si respiro profundamente
Ojalá te pudiera ver como antes
Acostados juntos a ver quién de los dos se dormía primero
Quisiera repetirlo
Te extraño, te amo
Pedazo de mierda

// SWAMP //

[Video Intro:]
[Ameer Vann:]
I could be here all day. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You're gonna tell me. Are you gonna tell me? Come on, spit it out...
[Robert Ontenient:]
Me Ilamo Roberto y este es el camino al éxito.

[Kevin Abstract:]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
[Matt Champion:]
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?

[Ameer Vann:]
My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope den we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Bitch, you tatted my name on it
Yellowstone I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala
Niggas like to talk down on me
When I see 'em I don't hear about it

[Kevin Abstract:]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside

They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?

[Merlyn Wood:]
Never would've have met my friends if not for satellites
Yeah, I'll cuff her even if she do not suck me right
Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time
Shh-shh, shh, I say please all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages

[Dom McLennon:]
I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
So that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

[Kevin Abstract:]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
[Matt Champion:]
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?

[Joba:]
You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face (woo, woo, woo!)
Then turn their back and switch up words you say (ah, ah, ah!)
Running to the papers everyday (woo, woo, woo!)
I'm running to the paper anyway (ah, ah, ah!)

[Kevin Abstract:]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside

They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me, (huh) what ya say?
Down

// TOKYO //

[JOBA:]
Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend
Might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the what-ifs and the what-whens and the what-thens
Wonder where my life went
Living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent
Are the bills paid?
Is it make or break?
Will I find a way?
Are my feelings changed?
Will I be okay?
I'll never know
But what I do know is
Life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent
So I place my bet

[Kevin Abstract:]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Ameer Vann:]
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in the woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas come and find me
Got his head in my eye view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running outta issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kin folk

[Dom McLennon:]
Taking a book out the page of the graves
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talkin' the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just cause I can't relate
I don't debate
I educate
Illuminate or we can't duplicate
No more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated, unappreciated
So I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you because
It's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you
You find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

[Kevin Abstract:]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?

// JESUS //

[Kevin Abstract:]
I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something that I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip, I tripped and I fell
Still think I'm living near Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit?
When I thought the automatic had an answer
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a cancer
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan, with a whole lotta melanin
Send them bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...

[Bear//Face:]
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you
I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, uh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you
I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, uh

// CHICK //

Why you look like that?
He look crazy as hell
But he dress well
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that?
Why your hair like that?
Why your teeth like that?
Why your cheeks like that?

[Matt Champion:]
I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short, but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like a psys- fuck!
You mean a psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to ya
Yeah I am not Carrabbas, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the fuck you's
'Cause they shit on your shit
Stab you right in the back
'Til you shittin' on the toilet with grammys in your lap

[Ameer Vann:]
Niggas talk a lot of shit
In a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard
They shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates
Money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like
Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names
I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston
Lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety
Seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations
Guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious
All these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience
Nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head

[Dom McLennon:]
I feel these voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose
They just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume
I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon
I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you
Sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights
They all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of exciting being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall
I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me
Building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream
I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth
Y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture
They wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens
And I saw the world in my lap

[Kevin Abstract:]
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag
All my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you
When I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the-

[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me Ilamo Roberto, y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith

[Kevin Abstract:]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues, and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take that mask off? That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay

Where I come from niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and
And my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head go, yeah

Friendly meal, cop and steal, all my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crackin' sounds
Friendly meal, cop and steal, all my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crackin' sounds
Friendly, friendly, friendly steal, all my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crack, crack, crack
Friendly meal, cop and steal, all my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup 'til I hear crack

[Ameer Vann:]
I don't trust nobody
'Cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house
They know you doin' dirty
(go ahead now)
I got my hand on an ounce
So now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth
And now I'm speedin', swervin'
(go ahead now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms
And now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills
I can't remember nothing
(go ahead now)
I ain't under control
I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention
I need an exorcism
I need a therapist
Paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary
My momma don't even recognise me
I'm goin' crazy
Don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation
I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences
I ain't runnin' from them

[Merlyn Wood:]
Feelin' like a goner
Put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer
If I had the option
I would do it all again
If I had the option
I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (again)
When I cut that feel I do nothing but diplomas
Love is going, bet you didn't do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a lana

[JOBA:]
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling wondering why
[Matt Champion:]
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
[JOBA:]
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'

[Matt Champion:]
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like "just the tip"
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say "fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 99, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off
Better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off
Before I blow your brains off, boy

[Dom McLennon:]
No hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of the life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned
I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision
That's a given, no slipping

// SCENE 2 //

[Robert Ontenient:]
Padre, gracias por mi familia
Te pido que los bendigas con tu favor
Proveeles sus necesidades
Te pido que los protejas del daño y la maldad
Rodéales con la sombra de tu ala
Ve delante de ellos y prepara su camino
Si su camino está torcido, te pido que lo endereces
Protégelos de las trampas del enemigo
Y evítales del engaño
Dales paz perfecta a sus corazones
En el nombre de Jesús te lo pido
Amén

// FIGHT //

[Ameer Vann:]
My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does
And like my teachers would say
"Little black boys have a place in the world"
Like hanging from trees
Or dead in the street like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark
I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave
Gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb
Refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey
See your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money
Don't care to cater to Mary
I'm fetishizing my spirit
I see your culture's dependent
On what you didn't inherit
Won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

[Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract:]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped
Who gonna be the reason why I get high

[Kevin Abstract:]
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen ya
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em

In the game

[Video Intro - Henock Sileshi, Kevin Abstract & Robert Ontenient:]
F***, s***!
[*Laughter*]
F***!
[*Coughing*]
Ah-ha-ha, I didn't—ha-ha-ha, ah!
F***!
I didn't know it was gonna—hehe
I didn't know it was gonna hit your dick
Ah, damn that shit [*bleep*]
Me llamo Roberto
Wait, what? That's a "Roberto"?

[Matt Champion:]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (howw!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained, man
Better offer the clone
Until you high as a plumber with race eyes, (chronic) doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make your bio-pic (haha)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's
Get the wing tings (yum)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (uh-oh)
Whatchu mean, it ain't working? (what?)
Whatchu mean, you ain't finding yourself? (oh, I am, I'm trying)
Whatchu mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit)
Whatchu mean? Whatchu mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (uh-huh)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (no)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (eh)

[Kevin Abstract:]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Dom McLennon:]
The original lick-splickety
Higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally
Master with no limiting
Making em say ugh
They worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip
In your temple of authenticity
Often they say I'm off it
I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on
I'll remind em with hostility
Hot diggity damn
Everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams
And take another glance
Running a clinic
No scans
Ain't no one claiming
Yo mans
It's all pertaining
To plan
Call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen
Each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Merlyn Wood:]
Don't call me stupid, that ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid, I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston, tryna see if Beyonce will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
I said they ain't shot, third war
We just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is the woodlands
I need a honeybutter
Vodka in an Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honeybutter
Puttin' lean in my Sprite can

[Kevin Abstract:]
Twistin' me up like licorice

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Ameer Vann:]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me they run
On 37th, used to run from the bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[JOBA:]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name, left to Hollywood
I was living off Ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up
If you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world
You could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Kevin Abstract:]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me out like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me out like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice and my boys and my wrist this flex
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Dom McLennon:]
I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all the time, could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up and see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right off the hook for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

Spit the diamond with us

And a horn to call my own
All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooo, that's a step-back
Ooo, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose I would not choose you
If I had to stop I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the breaks I'ma stop right

[Merlyn Wood]
All I do is work and play
Tryna' find a place to stay
Tryna' find some food today
This shit is real hard okay? Okay
Take that, homie got the lysol spray, ain't it?
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it?
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man they ain't friendly

It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
And got no ice on me, yeah, still 'ferring how I dress on me
These dickies and I got these hoes from WalMart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch

[Ameer Vann {Merlyn Wood}:]
I just saw my P.O, (what up, nigga?) he like me, though (he like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets though
7 days a week though {all day}
It's that heat though
My daddy called me said he seen my last video
Looking at a young me could'a had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' til its all gone, smoking til my folks come home
