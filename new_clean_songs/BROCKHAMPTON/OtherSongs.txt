Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker
Gossip, legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww man, God damn

Need an Altoid for your hot breath
Like a hot mess, pop your biceps
Cue the roid rage

[Kevin Abstract:]

Keep some baggy jeans on me
Keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me
Smellin' like a queen to ya

[Dom McLennon:]
Cu-cu-cucumber lemonade

Barber make the texture fade
Actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece
Baby give me something sweet
We don't gotta be discrete
Moonwalking between the seats

[Matt Champion:]
Hit on that beat and then stop
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie
Like I don't know cootie
My momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no-

Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level
Stop!

[Kevin Abstract & Dom McLennon:]

So quit talkin', bitch nigga (quit yo talkin', bitch) (ay)
Ay, I wanna buy a Jeep, ay
That's my energy
Trilogy, that's history
Southside baby rest in peace!

[Dom McLennon:]
Uh, lordy lordy, testify, yeah

"I can make you live forever
All you gotta do is dance until you die", yeah

[Jim Jones:]
"You're not free with your Cadillac! You're doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you'll never have any real economic freedom. He wants you to buy everything he advertises on TV, so he'll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You're not free, you're a slave!"

[Merlyn Wood:]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Joba:]
With these superficial people from my past
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets
This young man won't ever be shit"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long-ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out
Any situation but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

[Merlyn Wood:]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Kevin Abstract:]
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't

[Matt Champion:]
Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it, like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Blood and leaf color like fall
When you were callin', they said I'd be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th-th-they want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Hear all the voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say

[Dom McLennon:]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk
They forgot how to listen
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix new edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions
I don't ask permission, ain't no politician
Don't ask my opinion, you got an addiction
To what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians
And hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine?
I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me
Don't see you search for the meaning
I think that's why you ain't believing
The future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming
Of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fuckin' with
Get back

[Kevin Abstract:]
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't

[bearface:]
Won't you come this close to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (free)
Oh yeah
Won't you come this close to me
Baby baby baby yeah

[Kevin Abstract:]
And if I could erase, who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And if I could erase, who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Jazze Pha:]
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions, tigers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit
I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson Five the First
And I'd like to introduce to you Brock Denzel AKA Blockhampton
Oh boy, ladies and gentlemen

[Kevin Abstract:]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Matt Champion:]
32 hundred on the jacket like Magic, Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose her up with the drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else
I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la
When she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise
Double up, man, shake and fries

[Joba:]
I heard a call from the mountain top (Joba)
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were tryna be
Now other people from my village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe, you can tell me things
This was all foreseen, you're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took and then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

[Kevin Abstract:]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Dom McLennon:]
You know I had a dream for a nigga like to me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate?
Looking at my pace with your face screwed
Hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear
O'er here, my career, trust me you gotta to touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shit, could've crushed my gift
Even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menace is the Pledge of Allegiance
Tell my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Call my Gs facetious, but they can't believe this
So they act like the world should've known about me
All I know is that they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can't renounce me, like
[Joba:]
La, la, la, la

[Bearface:]
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, alright
I ain't gonna rush it no lie
Straight to the fire
Right to you, move on
We ain't got no money, alright
I ain't gonna rush it no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, alright
I ain't gonna rush it no lie
Straight to the fire
Right to you, move on
We ain't got no money, alright
I ain't gonna rush it no lie
(Woop)

[Kevin Abstract:]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold

Floor filled with girls, pretty liquor on my sneaker

Somethin' like fine wine, gotta sip it slow
Takin' my damn time, 'cause it taste right
Tow the fine line, white-knuckled and ready
Wide-eyed, so worth it and perfect
Guess I deserve it, quench my thirst in a drought
Savour every sip, all it takes is a call

To make you feel whole just not so alone
Never let you go

[Video Intro - Jabari Manwa:]
I am Jabari Manwa, and this is my confessions tape

[Kevin Abstract:]
This is everything I ever wanted though
Dreamin' of a candy store
Brother couldn't tell me no, no
So I need moments where I could be left alone
Yeah, she let me ride along
To a place where I belong, woah, no
If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?
Would you still be lying to yo mom and them
Don't you know I do this for your family?
Cause mine ain't believe in me
Left my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, wash sheets, repeat
Watch teachers teach

[Merlyn Wood:]
High and on the damn sidelines where the bleachers be
Always feel like city streets, wish I was back in my sheets, shit
Most days I don't wanna be me, shit
Don't watch this, teens watch TV, shit
My own family look like some OG shit
Shoutout my hood, they racist as hell, shit
I'm 'bout my papers like some damn immigrants, bitch

[Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood:]
One day I'mma get my bread up

One day I'mma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up

[Dom McLennon:]
I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back

[Ameer Vann:]
I been dripping candy paint
Grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone
You see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
Shout out to my cousin Mo
He got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary
He ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either
So send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers
Man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood
Besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab
Tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup
I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me
I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster
There's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga
With the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry
Why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million
And one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings

[Bear//Face:]
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly

But she gone' catch them southern feels
Because I get it while it's hot, I get it non stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town, let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist candy painted Lexus finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff take a puff, get buck feel the southern love

[Ameer Vann:]
Scumbag from the lonestar state
Come around here, you could be the next nigga on the first 48
Niggas run around with a snub 38
You gotta hold it down and protect your 28s
Because since 18 a nigga had a dream
Of that thang on the spokes
I got my mouth froze
Got them thangs for the low
Who the fuck spoke?
Don't mind my southern drawl
I got a pocket full of stones for all of y'all
If he up, then watch him ball
Plot to make these niggas fall
Shoot through walls
Take their money and their Ki's
And don't come back without it all
Screaming fuck 'em and we ball

Pushing weight
Got to educate
Niggas smoking on my scholarship
That's a win win
Allowances off these college kids
Brockhampton thicker than the wayans man
I'm an asshole
Run up in su casa and dun dun dun dun da da dun dun
They deported my uncle
Cause he ain't got the papers to prove it
Mama sent me to that white school (Not black!)
Prove I could speak like them white kids
Act like them white kids
Smoke like them white kids
Fuck that
I'm the all black johnny cash

// DON'T BE FAMOUS //

[Merlyn Wood:]
I sold that dope in the dormitory
I throw room and the ramen on me
I told my mom that she shouldn't worry
So I'm taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm fourty ('til I'm fourty)
I don't want to have to make, McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My [?] to every lad sandstormin'
Send them shop, exertin' Prada like it's a car show
The shit is pure man, why he sellin' Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my beaten convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, that's so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

[Merlyn Wood (reversed):]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't new
I had plans back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't new

[Matt Champion:]
Fuck the cops
They beatin' the cases
I see the pistol while they raisin' their aim
White doesn't fly when carnations they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Poppin' cherry color like her virginity
Carefully sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an eye up on the [?] bed with me
No wonder you [?] death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sippin' so long, [?] cologne
Fuck the percentages
I want the leverage, I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blur
Keep out my face with your, petty little urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

[Merlyn Wood (reversed):]
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't new
I had plans back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't new

[Kevin Abstract & Joba:]
Yeah (yow, yow, yow, yow)

[Dom McLennon:]
I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I didn't taste it, thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know about the stash house
Couple decades got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out

[Joba & Kevin Abstract:]
I keep dancing dancing (yow, yow, yow, yow)
I keep dancing dancing (yow, yow, yow, yow)
I keep dancing dancing (yow, yow, yow, yow)

// downside //

Yeah, go sit out
Go through somethin', blind new, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the gals come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch standby, feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til you both feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't leave you now, now-now-now

Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keepin' it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playin' pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard

[Joba:]
Angels watchin' over me, God damn
Hope the homies rest in peace, I can't
As I sink in the concrete
I throw a prayer to the old me

[Dom McLennon:]
Twenty-five, they said twenty-five, the P on one side, he just turned eighteen
Sun shinin' when they hit my cousin, it was like a mob passed him, an okay day
Shit, some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, man
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, man

[Kevin Abstract:]
.45, he got a.45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man
Sunset, just another text, and that last semester ain't mean a thing
Everything that's evil make me feel alive
Know my niggas on the Southside got my back tonight

If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it
Can you tell that I'm high? (Ooh, ooh)
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it, now (High, high)

Po-po said can't have more, they said, "I got no drugs"
They say, "Yo man, you drunk?" They said, "Drunk man, you lose"
They said, "Drunk man, come close," I was very confused

Got older, got a chain, nigga, god-damn
Shit is gold and it hurt me when I walk man
And I ain't got it but I just got my advance
So I might cop it, yeah, nigga that's my energy
I might tell these niggas that they ain't no friends to me
'Cause I'm tired of these niggas sucking clout up
Like a motherfuckin' 'squito in the trough, bruh

I just bought a scale, now err'where a traphouse
I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock of iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa
I kill my haters then I leave 'em for the vultures

God-damn, man, I think I need a therapist
Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup (sippy cup)
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff (the pocket fluff)
Took it to myself like I hear my best friend (hello, hello, hello)
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing (hello, hello, hello)
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape (oh)
Barely late to my first date with my therapist

[Merlyn Wood:]
Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick
And I'm still 'bout to cry outta both heads

I'm sorta back
I'll quarter back yo side chick
Hut hut one hike bitch
Don't hide her I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it
Hit it twice then get blinded
We get blunted
I don't trust em
And I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it I found me a stranger, I took her to dinner
And then I got in it I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than taking this chick on the road
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is 6th place, type to get misplaced drunk and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click clack boom bap goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet

[Joba:]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years, to waste on thoughts unclear

[Kevin Abstract:]
I don't need you, I don't one I need some more

You need a hero, you need a hero baby
You need a hero, you need a hero baby

[Matt Champion:]
You can't wait for love that shit don't last forever
I can't wait for you that shit don't last forever
I know you well know you better than yourself
Know your ins and outs and curves you swerving straight into your house
You know my name
Say my name touch yourself we got issues
Know your frame
Know your game we got issues
Know I'm lame
Know you same we got issues
Keep it strange
No to blame
Fuck you and your shit
Swear you burn like matches tip
Swear you fucked like half these kids
How to love on such a bitch
Shoulda fucked up on your cousin
She look good even with black eyes
Next time that you say you love me baby I'll just ask why ya here

No more tears
No more fears
No more years, to waste on thoughts unclear

Like you got a knife to my throat or the wind blowin' a tightrope
Or someone repeatin' what I'm saying, like, I know (I know)
If I was never wrong I would've been right, right?
Wrong, bitch, if I was right, I wouldn't be here with this long face
Plenty of red flags, I'da skipped and throw away
Matter made me better or I'm just stupid, who's to say?
Are there some angels in my area?
If I don't like the function, can I post up on the barrier?
Ass so fat, I put my cup up on the derriere
Fashion shit is shakin', I'll be honest, I am very scared
And if I ever die young (Die young)
Have Larry David do the eulogy (Eulogy)
And film it on one of those little camcorders where you can barely see
And hire someone to throw up all in my jewelry

I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact

Pull up 'round the corner and we make the block hot

No reassurance, this here, I burn it
I got insurance for the way I'm 'bout to shock the systems
About that action, blow the pistons
Cut ties, better learn 'bout subtraction
Can't keep the bug get out my system
What we missin'?
Need that boom, boom, boom, boom
Drop it out

We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Ayy), we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, yeah
We bring the mob out (Bring the mob), we finna mob out (Finna mob)
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy (Leave your jaw)
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out (Bring the mob), we finna mob out (Finna mob)
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy (Leave your jaw)
Leave your jaw down, yay

Did it last night I heard you say (Heard you say)
Love 'em all but dying, 'cause that was in the way
Well if you don't mind (I just need you here with momma)
I think I'll leave (I think I'll leave)
Leave 'em all together, means everything to me

// MVP //

Give me the rock, and I'ma show you all the ways to be the MVP
Even if you own a bank, you still can't check me
See, I was born for this, I ain't the type to sport technique
And I ain't waitin' for a catch, you better accept me, ya dig?
I can hear the ball, I don't get chatty
Take you to the house like I'm Trick Daddy
If I'm skippin' through the lane, it could end badly
Hit a pose for the camera when it gets flashin'
If you don't know, my body take your vitamins
Got the bench warmed like Natasha Idi Amin
Plays they makin' could be cock-inspirin'
Next possession point like I'm LaMelo, then I'm firin'
Blam, crowd goes wild, I'm the man
Baby, I'm the coach, just so you know, we had a plan
If you wanna stop me, better have a diagram
I was number one before the season had began

Boy, you make me wanna, boy you make me wanna
Boy, you make me wanna, go head, go head, go-o
Boy, you make me wanna, jump, jump, boy, you make me wanna
Boy, you make me wanna, JUMP, JUMP go head, go head, go-o

I'ma put you on a poster
Call fatheads and tell 'em
Put your head where my palm is
See yo' ass on out call the chauffeur
Speed dial, no sir, under there, Oprah?
Catch a rest from over there in Lot B
The Mazdas, the Kias, and the Air-Four 50s
Don't see passion in any eyes I see
Fear of the foe that is coming closely
I'mma slang through the lane
Rolling like window pane
Got a jump of the rank
Get a rang dang lang
Know the feet on the sheet
That's showing stain danes
I'm a beast for the title
Hit my phone like rang rang

Boy you make me wanna, boy you make me wanna
Boy you make me wanna, go head, go head, go-o
Boy you make me wanna, JUMP, JUMP boy you make me wanna
Boy you make me wanna, JUMP, JUMP go head, go head, go-o

Come and get it, come, come and get it
Swimmin in the paint triple digits on the ceiling?
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin'
Whippin' and winnin' minute by minute
I'm sending it up, deep in the box
Free throws you won't even see me
Bring the Bock, hands up
Did you say som'n?
Swish, swish
That's the sound of the champion!
Ankles break then its served like it's and-one
Lace up, defense, offense my fence
Get back, you don't wanna miss this
I'mma be like Mike, check it off my wishlist
Don't miss the shots I take! (Don't miss)

JUMP
JUMP JUMP
JUMP
JUMP!

(Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties)
Niggas they talkin', they ain't about shit
Pull off, 30 stay in my wallet
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo if it ain't a problem better not come to me
Mans keep talking like he a prophet (Woah)
No time to learn that we ain't 'bout it (Woah)
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo if it ain't a problem then don't come to me
I said
(Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties)

And I ain't taking "no" no more
Them niggas grew up on Screw?
What the fuck dawg, now we getting back to the beginning
You gave me scrimmage, I played the finish
Remember them old days I was fucking 'round with women
We was backin' up them drives like we was finished
Runnin' 'round in Corpus, two-door, I explore
Hit the gas then he floor it
We just took off with some more shit

Pray to God he keep my money straight
One-four SUV behind me like motorcade
Shot on that bitch at an alarming rate
Chills in your body they glisten and shimmer like you just went out of the armory, uh-uh
Move he dippin and dive whenever you cry, I will arrive
Blood, sweat and tears will let you go fly
But how do you float, uh-uh, staying afloat, uh-uh
Shorty be tip, coning in Burt
Shoutout Kids Club, we ain't Kelly
I'm going fast you ready, I keep the celly on silent
I hope the future is vibrant, for all of my brothers all of my kin
All of my gang
(Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties)

Big tr-big tr-big tr-big tr...

Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh

Close the door
Watch me go out
I'm gettin' closer to God
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me

// SUGAR (Remix) //

It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in the drop top, your legs on the dashboard
(Your legs on the dashboard, ooh)
So tell me what I have to do
Whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own
Don't need nobody's help
I been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Loving me and it keeps hurting me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, my call to God
Selfishly I keep it all for me
Usually I don't wait too long
But for you I might

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I don't wanna blink and see you out (I don't)
Pressed up on my body like no doubt (No doubt)
I don't want this moving too fast
(Play your part) That's a damn shame
Run and go make your man insane

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Show me all the sugar I been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
I be inspired, we relating
Baby, just don't keep me waiting
Come be my sugar baby

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, passport

You're takin' my heart all over again
Watchin' my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body

So do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh

I'm your candy man
I'll be your candy man
I'm your candy man

I'm your candy man
I'll be your candy man
I'm your candy man

// things can't stay the same //

[Amnesty (DJ Bobbito Garcia):]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
(Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties)

[Kevin Abstract:]
Summertime so I got my head out the window
Your car smell like weed, it's that good Texas Indo
Back when nobody believed in me except for you
They don't accept you, unless they get to dress you
Technically speaking is making me bitter
I'm too high to focus, and more weed got delivered
What could make our life simpler
Send it straight to my liver
Send my name out in flames, and then it crash in the winter
I showed up boy and I checked out the same day
I signed in boy, and I logged out the same date
Oh, mmm, mmm, ayy
My OGs taught me to do it my way
Texas boys, everything is sideways
Might upload the whole tape to MySpace
I like the music blown out, that's just my taste
Keep the vinyl packed in some blue crates
(Look up at the stars if you start to get lonely
It's crazy this all started with just us wanting some money)

[Matt Champion:]
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah

What do I want out of life, what do I bleed for?
So many shoulders, I can go and lean my head on
But I still smoke and crave respect from those that cheer on
Wish I could focus more on what I get my cheer from
Who really know you, who really love you? I wanna see
I gotta hit you for a mission and, yes, we outspeed
So many take the high road to let the pain seep
I need to learn a lot in life is a one-way-street
Yeah, the ghost where Waco is, only time for takeout
Not a lot of room in this world, so keep your gate up
I'll meet you at the driveway, call Matt out
With the lights on, bright for real, drive back out
Yeah, jet-lag for pilots, only flyin' to islands
Call them taxes filed, money gettin' piled in
Green by the means, turn to envy by the thousand
Love to bring you down in the depths you would drown in

[Amnesty:]
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
No, no, things can't stay the same

// twisted //

Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

Some days I just don't feel it (Don't feel it)
Some days I want my days to pass right by and change my spirits (Yeah)
Your hatin' made me fearless (Me fearless)
If it do not make me happy or bread
Then, dawg, well, I just can't deal with it (Deal with it)
Swear to God I'm 'bout my business (My business, yeah)
Got both of these boys kissin' (Straight kissin')
These drinks, they got me spinnin' (Spinnin')
B boy, the way they twistin' up my words
For months they said I was missin'
Man, the world ain't out to get ya
They just tryna dismiss ya, 'miss ya, 'miss ya

They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Yeah)
All day, all night, I worry, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)
Shawty like, shawty like (Yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Ooh, fun)
I think all night, I worry, shawty like
Shawty like, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)

Tryna' drag my name in the dirt
There they go twistin' my words
Talkin' 'bout this what he say she say
Tell'em I don't give a fuck
Tell'em It ain't my concern
You ain't gotta be in my world
Talkin' 'bout this what he say she say
I don't give a fuck
(Give a fuck, give a fuck)
Stay ridin' 'round with my team, we don't give a fuck
I keep my space serene, still don't give a fuck
They don't wanna see me gleam, I been knew wassup

(Yeah, okay, yeah)
My attention span is outrageous
So invested 'til you come faceless
Where's the finish line that I can walk towards?
'Cause otherwise I'm on vacation
My location gone, my dick is long
I'm up and down till I make a song
Now tell me what I'm doin' wrong
So I can leave your ass and I make you feel neglected
Paranoid and uninvested
My money's gone but there's a bigger picture I got goin' on
"Who you signin' to?"
"When the album come?"
"When your next shit drop can you make a song that goes to the lines of goin' through?"
'Cause your new shit's good, but I gotta say
When I heard those chords I was blown away
Nah, fuck that, my family just wants their son back
Lucky me, I'm just a scumbag
I watch a little TV, then it's back to the lab again
Workin' nights 'cause I wanna compete with producers
Out do these brain-dead losers
Yeah, you hate me, that's excuses, and I hate you too
If we were in the same room I think I'd fuck you too
I'm done with playin' games, you lame excuse of a stoner boy
I'm tired of people weighin' me down
I'm about to drown in this empty void cause
Hey, I'm done with playin' games, shawty
Yeah, she wanna suck my dick, shawty

They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Yeah)
All day, all night, I worry, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)
Shawty like, shawty like (Yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Ooh, fun)
I think all night, I worry, shawty like
Shawty like, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)

Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
