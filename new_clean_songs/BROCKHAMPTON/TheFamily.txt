Album: TheFamily

// Take It Back //

God will love it, today, yay
Just be me, I will live it today (Oh, oh-oh)
God will love it, today, yay (Wait, you gotta love it though)
How could you not love it though?
Uh, yeah, yeah

Let's take it back to when, me and Ashlan
Was out front schemin', right off Jefferson
Had the hoes screamin', and the niggas too
Kept the trunks beatin', brought the noise through
The sun shine on me, California things
Tyler, big brother, California dreams
He kept me at a distance, California stings
Now I'm out in Calabasas where the choir sings
Praise God 'cause that man taught me how (Yeah)
To be myself and get my niggas off that couch (Yeah)
The group broke up and made me feel hot again (Woo)
If we talkin' 'bout groups, we still top ten
I had to save the truth for the last shit (Uh)
Anything I said before this was passive (Uh)
Had to saturate the streets with some classics
Then we went number one like Magic
Coachella, send it off for my family
Dom' Fike gon' say "B, look at this family tree"
Money in my bank account, I can't believe
Had to wash the blue paint off, so I can be free

So I could be free
Keep that shit rollin', nigga
We just gettin' started, yeah, yeah

I know I gotta be, strong for the family (Yeah)
Long time coming, who wanna start a band with me?
Merlyn been around since day one (Woo)
When he dropped out of college, we was there for him
That man's an architect (Yeah), this ain't the end for him (Yeah)
I wanna see y'all in the stands, wave your hands for him
Who would've thought we made it off that damn forum?
Man, I wish we got to play the Forum (Woo)
But next time, in another life, somewhere in the skies
We all will reunite
We'll have a cookout and you could bring the kids by
Your niggas by, your bitches by
Never know who is bi
With all them niggas y'all, I love them niggas y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
I'm sorry homie, but that don't apply to us at all
The next chapter is everything
That's my promise to y'all

God will love it, today, yay
Just be me, I will live it today
Mm

// RZA //

Yo, yo
I was talking to my mom the other day
And she was tryna give me advice
About everything that's going on since shit
And I get so lost in my motherfuckin' head
And I be think—
I tried to turn it into somethin'
Tried to turn it into something like
A few bars
Let's hear me out, hear me out, hear me out, it's aight
Yo, yo (Yeah), yo, yo

I know I gotta be (Come on)
More like RZA be (Come on, come on)
My momma asking me (Woo)
"Ian, why don't you keep the band together?" (Woo)
I know it's hard, but keep the band together (Come on)
Me and your dad were fighting, we stayed together (Come on, come on)
Even once we split, we stayed together (Woo, woo)
Be like your mom and keep the fam' together

All of the songs where I dissed my mom
Helped me help her stay in her home
Now I'm finna lose my home
So never diss where you come from
I gotta be the American flag
Texas where I'm from, got the drums in my bag
Bum-bidi-bum-bidi-bum-bidi-bum
Bum-bidi-bum-bidi-bum-bidi-bum
Mom, I'm feeling new, my hate for you is through
The things that we went through
I wish that I could do it all over again
Even all by myself, cause now I've lost my friends
But I fuck with myself and

This is what I do whenever I feel excited
This is for my people outside who ain't invited
This is what I do whenever I feel excited
I love it, I love it, I love it, oh-oh-oh

I know I gotta be
More like RZA be
My momma asking me (Woo)
"Ian why dont you keep the band together?" (Woo)

You know what's so funny, y'all on RCA right?
That's what, that's what, I mean, that's your major
That's what Wu was on
Referring to the relationships we've encountered
I thought we agreed not to talk about those

// Gold Teeth //

Nowadays, all I wanna do is party
Getting fucked up in my hotel's lobby
Only made this to get out the deal, partly
So don't ask me if the crew is still talking
Do we see each other? Hardly
Shit we made together? Godly
Did we sign for too many motherfuckin' albums? Probably
Got my first gold teeth at the swap meet
Felt the temperature change when we dropped "HEAT"
Came such a long way from Corpus Christi
San Marcos, soft shell tacos blanco
All the rocks thrown, woke niggas on my cock, though
Is it a dream to see tomorrow?
Always better to make it
You can't become unfamous, your clout just start fading
This blueprint, we made it
Y'all niggas, y'all just be takin' and stealin'
The way we be filming the way we fuck a nigga up
But still gon' speak up 'bout how the fuck we be feeling
I ain't gon' let no white nigga meme my ass up out the building (Hell nah)
I say it with my chest 'cause for years, I just been chillin'
And let y'all get them bars off (Bitch-ass niggas)
While y'all bumpin' BH knockoffs (Poor bitch-ass niggas)
I'm the richest nigga you ever seen fall off (Facts)
I'm the richest nigga you ever seen fall off (Facts)

(Oh, fuck you)

// Big Pussy //

Fuck you
Fuck you, come up here then
Oh, wow, big pussy
You guys ready?
Yo, yo
Shut your bitch-ass up, nigga, uh

Fuck you to anyone that claim that they got me (Uh)
When my heart was low, it turn to kami-kamikaze
Respect was takin' back my gallery, I'm finna spaz (Yeah)
The truth is everything we need, can we agree with that? (Yeah)
The group is over without being on the album (Huh)
I'm back and ready, Ciarán had to bring it out me (Huh)
I love to hate, but these days I'ma keep it classy (Huh)
Niggas I made, I love to see them boys surpass me (Huh)
Flava Flav with the way we keep it nasty (Huh)
Jesus my Savior, own my masters like Master P
I can't explain it, dawg, you know it's how magic be
You gotta bring it if you gettin' on a track with me
This shit a classic, it ain't even been out a week
The show is over, nigga, please stop harassing me
Stop asking me, it's bad enough for me to deal with this tragedy
On my own (On my own, on my own, on my own)

What? On my what?
Oh, no, no, don't, no
Listen to me, nigga

Ooh, boy, you still a bitch, boy, you ain't doin' shit, boy
This that murder shit, boy, this that learn to destroy
The label needed thirty-five minutes of music
It's the true shit, faggot nigga out of Houston
Doin', whatever the fuck I'm 'posed to do, yeah
Moshing at the shows, surprised we ain't get sued yet
Crowds go loco, we lean into their amusement
After shows taking photos with all the new fans
I don't roll solo, need the crew to maneuver
Through the loose and dark and stupid kinda movements
Injectin' hope into a generation
Of a lotta lonely motherfuckers sick of waiting
We ain't taking all them punches to the fucking faces
Just to let some fuck niggas come around and say some fake shit
My everyday lifestyle ain't nothin' but a hustle
Can't nobody tell me shit, I made it out the jungle

My everyday lifestyle ain't nothing but a hustle
Gamble, slinging, doing stick-ups, nobody move a muscle
My everyday lifestyle ain't nothing but a hustle
Gamble, slinging, doing stick-ups, nobody move a muscle

// All That //

Back when we was still outside (Yeah)
Church next door, we couldn't afford a tie
I was only nineteen, I was down for the ride (Woo)
Everything I wanted on my passenger side (Yeah)
Embraced who we was, we was broke, we was live
We would smoke, we was high
We would smile just to vibe (Yeah)
Fightin' to survive, just to get ideas out (Come on)
When niggas was hungry, couldn't afford the big house (Come on)
Niggas was scrawny, somebody break the ribs out
Fightin' over meals, the crib was not Aunt Viv's house
Man, press photo with the blue couch
Now we hate each other just to hang out (Come on)

Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that
Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that

It's all of us sittin' there in the living room
I'm like, "Fuck it, yo, this what we finna do
I can't stand seein' us not there
On the big screen with the homies here
We know once we get that shot
We gon' push limits and never look back" (Yeah, uh)

Fast forward, everything feels backwards
Everything went left at the BRIT Awards
When I decided not to show up or show support
'Cause I was tryna go solo before we went on tour (Come on)
Too much trauma for me to be at my highest (Come on)
I missed Ameer, so me and Dom kept fightin' (Mm)
He almost pushed me off the edge (Edge)
But honestly, I shouldn't've said what I said (Yeah)
I shoulda went to therapy instead
I started to heal, that's what we all needed
The record deal wasn't helpin' either (Come on)
That merch deal ain't help either, man (Come on)
It gave me more money for alcohol
I guess blowin' up ain't all that at all

Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that
Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that

// (Back From The) Road //

Hey

When I get back from the road
He just like me, front row
Love when they singing these songs
Venue turns into my home

Gas station, 2 AM
Yelling so loud with my kinfolk
My pants ain't Raf Simons
Yeah, these Dickies from Walmart
Tour bus smoked out
Don't let Jon find out
I'm waking up alone
HK's snore is still going
Throwing on my cologne
Hiding my hickeys that Nick was giving me
Trilogy popping, it's awesome
It's gon' take a second for y'all to get rid of me (Hey)

When I get back from the road
He's just like me, front row
Love when they singin' these songs
Venue turns into my home
When I get back from the road (Can I get? I'm back from the road)
He's just like me, front row (Front row)
Love when they singin' these songs (Oh, hate when they singin')
Venue turns into my home (Oh, turn when he sing)

Cribs in Carolina, Waffle House in Georgia
Sunset looks like make-believe, I'ma see my aunt in Florida
Screaming in the lobby, hotel wanna sue me
Ashlan keep the camera rollin', now our life's a movie

// Basement //

Yeah
Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Yeah (Yeah)

Back to the basics
Back to the basement
Back to the fire
Back to the gang (Gang, gang)
Back to the basics (Gang)
Back to the basement (Gang, gang)
Back to the fire
Back to the gang

I don't know you, nigga
I don't know you, nigga
I don't know you, nigga
You definitely ain't my family, family
I don't know you, nigga, c'mon
I don't know you, niggas, c'mon
I don't know these niggas
They definitely not in my family, family

Bitch, you actin' nosy
You actin' like the police
You actin' like you know me
You just know these songs, uh
You just know these videos
You don't know my mom, uh
You ain't got my telephone number
Unless that nigga leak it, uh
I don't fuck fans, if they say so, don't believe it, uh
Yeah, I love my fans, but they'll kill me if they can

I don't know you, nigga
I don't know you, nigga
I don't know you, nigga
You definitely ain't my family, family
I don't know you, nigga, c'mon
I don't know you, nigga, c'mon
I don't know these niggas
They definitely not in my—

// Good Time //

Yeah, uh
I'ma call 'em out like

Pack up my bags (Yeah), I know it's time to leave (Uh)
The show is over, it ended overseas (Bye)
Take them plaques down, it's time to move on (Time)
Call up my real family, it's time I go home (Damn)
No more changes (Uh-huh), no more playlists (Uh-huh)
No more due dates (Nah), no more fake shit (Ayy, but, uh)
I'll miss runnin' 'round the city with you, though, you know I cannot lie (You know what I mean, though?)
I changed a bit from a minute ago, you know I ain't that same guy (Why?)
I got a chain now, I got a lane now (Bye)
I changed my style a while ago and it still hurt that we don't hang out
Lost my tribe and gang now, yes, lil' bitch, and over payouts
Art hurts, but it's worth it, my dog, and so please, won't you stay down?
I'd do anything to keep you in my life
Whatever you need, I got you forever (Right? Right?)

And we said forever (But I guess)
Forever don't last too long
And we said forever (So it seems)
Forever's only long as a song (Don't go)
May not see my brothers, though
Please don't test my brothers, though
Young as fuck, broke as fuck
Sausage roll, gullible
Corner store, gas me, though
Askin' me which set we from
But I get it, we young, we dumb
Film a video 'til the sun get done

Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Eat it in the hood
Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Special in the hood, hood
Bitch, them was the good times

It be so fucked up, I be doin' Zoom calls
Talkin' with niggas about personal shit
I'm like, "Yo, make sure we filmin' this
Keep the camera rollin'"
That's a toxic relationship
That's what our friendship turned into
I turn everything into art

// Southside //

Don't give a fuck if they judge us
It's my life, so so what?
Moved out just to blow up
Three tapes, blow up
Whole fam' show up
Remember you don't know us

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

For my folks I ride, you know I do that, yeah
Music's so loud, feel stupid, yeah
Decked out the crib with computers, yeah
I know you feel it in the music, yeah
All the old cribs look like a museum
Van Nuys and south side was ruthless, yeah

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

Keep the hunger, yeah, know me, yeah, look at me, point and stare
Go into a new year with the vision hella clear
Yeah, they keep it delicate, growin' up, I'm barely rich
This that reminiscin' shit, remind me of the early shit
Shit that we was on when the sun felt sunny
Shit that we was on when music was not money

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

Hello? Hello?
Yo, Ian?

// Boyband //

I think the thing that y'all got that's special that people don't have
Is the ability, I guess, when you guys coined the—
The "boy band" of it all? (Yeah)
That element there, nobody got that

We always thought outside of the lines
Filmin' videos outside, sunrise
DIY made the crew supersize
Buncha gold records, what a wonderful surprise, uh-oh
My teachers said I wouldn't be shit, yeah
My brother said I shouldn't be here
Uh, we did an album in a week, yeah
Uh, and JOBA mixed it by the weekend (Yeah)
No street shit, borderline genius (Woo)
Borderline freakish, dye my hair greenish
Y'all so geekish
In the group where we just keep it (Uh, uh)
Keepin' speakers bleedin' (Yeah, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Yo, summertime needs this (Uh-oh)
Uh, I said, "Summertime needs this" (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Yeah, girl, summertime needs this (Uh-oh)
Summertime, yo

My dear friend, what a wonderful surprise
I'm ready to go, I can feel it inside
Think I know I need to go
So I can reach new highs
My dear friend, what a wonderful surprise (Woo)
I'm ready to go, I can feel it inside
Think I know I need to go
So I can reach new highs

We will try to pretend
In my seat with the band

// 37th //

I know it hurts, but this is my favorite way (Yeah)
I know it's hard, but please, just hear what I say
If I could fly through a California night
I'd end up back on 37th Street

At the dark end (Yeah), of the street (It's all my fault, all my fault)
The dark end (Like), of the street (Say, mm-hmm, oh)
Dark end (Oh-oh, oh) of the street (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, yeah)
That's where we always meet (Uh-huh, always meet)
Uh, uh-oh

In the Murci' with my flannel with my Vans on
Out in Brooklyn with Ciarán makin' these damn songs
This my vacation, this my Cancún
To my brothers who I love, I know I failed you
Linked up with Ameer to see what he been up to
I praise God for the days that we been through
Some days, I face God, some days, I see the devil too
I was nervous, ain't know what I was gettin' into
Dog, I seen growth, dog, I seen change
Wasn't like the old days, it felt different, man
My heart skippin' again, my thoughts driftin' again
Can we get the band back together and be civil again?
Empathy's a bitch, man, mix that bitch with some shame
And some weed and champagne, you end up like me
Tryna make everybody happy when I'm only there for me
I'm searchin' for healin' even when I'm asleep
I'm searchin' for friends when I'm the one endin' things
But I can't be sad about it, it's the life that I lead
You know gettin' over you, it ain't been easy for me
So now I'm workin' through the pain, gettin' fucked up in between like—

I know it hurts but this is my favorite way (It's gettin' really hard to try to sit you down every time and say)
I know it's hard, but please, just hear what I say (But if you really open up your mind, try to hear a nigga—)
If I could fly (That's why we down), through a California night (See why we down)
I'd end up back on 37th Street (Type of shit that I be dealin' with, yeah, yeah)

Dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in sh-

// Any Way You Want Me //

There aren't really many people I would change for
But I guess I would change for y'all
'Cause you gave me everything (Gave me everything)

And you can take me
Any way you want me
I know you hate me
But what if I could change?

And, baby, you're still my best friend even when I don't see you
You're still my best friend even if I don't need you
Still my best friend even when I don't see you
I promise, oh, I promise

And you can take me
Any way you want me
I know you hate me
But what if I could change?

That's such a toxic bar, it's like
"I know that you don't like who I am, but I'll change for you!
I'll change for you right now!"
I'm always into the toxic relationships
BROCKHAMPTON

// Prayer //

I love these niggas so much
I love these niggas so much
I love these niggas so much
God, please, don't make me grow up
God, please, don't make me grow up
God, please, don't make me grow up
God, please, don't make me grow up
God, please, don't make me grow up
God, please, don't make me grow up

Twitter, please, don't make me show up
Reddit, please, you gon' make me throw up
All them niggas finna make me throw up
Fuck them fans, y'all niggas made me throw up
Fuck them shows, nig— mm-mm, club
'Finna move the whole shit to the club
To the club, to the club, to the club
I'd rather be in the club gettin' fucked up

I love these niggas so much
I love these niggas so much
God, please, don't make me grow up

It's all a dream, everything
It's all so familiar
It's solid blue, it's all I knew
I'll do good while I'm still here
You know where to find me
I'll do good
You know where to find me
I'll do— mm

Alright, that's enough now
Cut that shit off

// My American Life //

Dead tired, feelin' stupid
It's just my American life (I'm dreaming man)

New shoes, new apartment
That's all, my American life
And I got nothing to say, and I got nothing to say
And I got nothing to say, and I got nothing to say
And I got nothing to say, and I got nothing to say
And I got nothing to say, and I got nothing—, nothing
And I got nothing to give, that's why I made you this tape
I been climbing this wall, how much more can I take?
Sometimes I think about dying, but then I think of those days
Sometimes I wish we could speak, but I have nothing to say

Dead tired, feelin' stupid (Feelin' stupid)
And this is my American life

Thank you, thank you
Thank you all, let's get it, let's get i—, let's—

// The Family //

Motherfuckers be sayin'
"Say this, but don't— don't say it like that though
Say it this way
'Cause you gotta think about all of us, represent all of—"
Motherfuckers be—
Motherfuckers meanin' niggas I came up with
Motherfuckers meanin' myse—

I know I should've called you sober
'Cause I'm right back on my own
Devil on my shoulder laughin'
Sayin', "Kevin, don't forget you're alone"

Y'all know what it's like, y'all got families
But it's so different from my family from Texas
I know what it's like, but it's so different

Merlyn saw the Sugar video, asked if I sold my soul to the devil
In some ways I guess I did because my mama still livin' in the ghetto
But any extra signs, yo, yo, that was not on purpose
But I get it, 'cause it gets dark whenever Hollywood opens the curtain
I was way less vanilla when I was still a Texas nigga
I was way more Christian when I was still a Mormon nigga
I was a hungrier artist when Postmates ain't deliver to our house in Laurel Canyon
In a mansion with some niggas I can't stand, man
But I gotta hold it down for my new fam, man
I gotta hold it down and hold my stance, man
God, bring me a different band, man
As the checks grew, it became harder to leave
Everybody got an ego now, imagine bein' me
Competition started off so healthy
'Til one day I looked up like, "Damn, you almost better than me"
I don't feel guilty for wakin' you up when you sleep
I don't feel guilty from cuttin' your verse from this beat
I don't feel guilty for heat you caught from my tweets
Dead projects I teased from my lack of empathy
I feel free when I drink, you don't know shit about me
Y'all don't know shit about me, y'all don't know shit about me
Quit talkin' sh—

I know I should've called you sober (You sober)
'Cause I'm right back on my own
Devil on my shoulder laughin'
Sayin', "Kevin, don't forget you're alone" (You're alone)

Okay, I said my piece, the whole room goes silent
Who do I turn to when my thoughts get violent?
When my voice goes hoarse, and we all stop cryin'
We said we'd do this shit for life, now I'm the last one tryin'

I know what it's like, but it's so different
You tried to keep it alive
Oh, oh-oh, oh
But I'll be fine
So why won't you listen, baby (You tried, woo)
You tried to keep it alive (Yeah)
But I'll be fine
Oh, yes, you did
Woo

// The Ending //

Let me be the one that you cling to
Let me be the one that you call on
Let me be the one that you cling to (Let me be the one)
Let me be the one that you call on
You can mute it for me

Back when I had a 'fro still
First moved to L.A., my daddy still paid my phone bill
I was sneaking niggas out in the early morning
After sucking good dick on a Sunday morning
Walking through the living room, I see Jabari yawning
I'm thinking, "Man, one day we all gon' be some superstars"
And this is way back before I had a credit card
And this is way back when I ain't have a debit card
And this is way back when we all still prayed to God
When Clancy believed in me when fans wasn't singing songs
When Kelly would talk to me when I ain't have no friends at all
Besides them niggas that I lived with
This the most corrupted vision
I turned my friendship into a business into an empire
Half a million that I wired to my mama, she retired
Call Ameer, I'm getting tired of the drama

Getting tired of letting culture try to tell me how to live my life
How to live my life
How to live my life
This the ending we all envisioned, right?
This is me, Abstract gone for the night (For the night)
How you feel?

// BROCKHAMPTON //

Sorry, Kiko
Yeah, all together
I just want my
I'm in a different vehicle
I got you guys, I got you
I got it
Can I get a Big Mac and a ten-piece Chicken Nuggets
Sheesh, he's hungry, he's hungry
I see the vision
I been seen the vision
Yo

I miss the band already
Fuck that, I miss my old man already
The kids broke up the band already
So this one right here for the fans, already
ROADRUNNER sessions was a blessing
Russell healing, I was sober
Doing keto, I was tryna focus
My mind stronger, in the studio longer
But deep down, I was still a coward
"BUZZCUT," rerecording it for hours
'Til I had that verse feeling rowdy
Took out that line about niggas tryna cancel me
Protect my brothers, fuck that plan that I had for me
I know I got it in me
So I played the game, even when the game was filthy
Derek and Brian, they was tryna convince me
That "COUNT ON ME" was the one to make us a billi'
But really, I wanted something that felt more real
But still be a popstar
Without making radio songs
And no TikTok bangers
My dreads hang, I grew up on Lil Wayne, bitch
We all tired of hearing all the same shit
I hear you talking, we don't speak the same language
We ain't make the trilogy for a play-a-list
I wish I knew the day that we signed that it would change shit
TECH DIFF, the last one to feel true
And baby boy, you know, these issues ain't new
What would you do if you had that house with a pool?
Me and Jabari had a fight that changed our relationship
When you yelling at your brothers, it gets dangerous
I don't think our love's ever been the same since
Now I only yell at God and my therapist
Now I only yell at God, I lost my therapist
Right? Did I do that right?
Honestly, there were issues before ROADRUNNER
Iridescence, I wasn't really there for my brothers
Barely present, more focused on bad relationships
It was good for my image, I got lost in it
That's when I first started drinking, lost my hunger, man
When you make it, it feels like the longest summer, man
Went from wondering to struggling
Thank God, y'all was down to be patient, man
Ended up on so many different stages, man
Brought the whole family with us when we hit Japan
We gained a friend just to get used to losing 'em, feel like I lost a limb
Niggas mad Ameer and me started talking again
I guess that's why I ain't seen niggas from the group like
I wish one of you niggas would just call me, man
We was an army, man, remember the plans we had?
Remember when rehearsals ain't go by so fast?
Remember when touring ain't revolve around cash?
But I can't even blame you 'cause my mama need the bag
And your daddy need the bag, this shit ain't gotta be so sad
I wouldn't take nothin' back even if I could rewrite the past
Joba, you the most musical motherfucker
Matt, I know you a perfectionist but now you free
Dom, ain't nobody fucking with you lyrically
Merlyn, can't nobody match this nigga's energy
Bari, the world 'bout to see who you finna be
Ciarán, you brought the truth out of me
I was living in a fantasy
The next chapter is everything that we said it would be
This next chapter is everything that we want it to be
The show's over, get out your seats

Get out your seats
Get up, get the fuck up, let's go
Get out your seats, move, the show is over
Let's go
No, no, no, it's solo time, nigga
It's all o-
Hahaha
After all that we've been through
Breaking up is hard to do
I hate to leave you behind
But I can't go on living this lie
I just want to live a life that's free
