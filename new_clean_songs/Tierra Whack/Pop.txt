// Body Of Water //

I've never been to jail
Tell a nigga that I'm in here like gel
I just want the paper, can I read the mail?
Tell them it's a fee without the male
Do tell, do tell
Yeah, you dig it like a ditch
If I paid you some attention you would probably be rich
Sucks to be you, ol' gold digging bitch
Shit, I'm running this shit like Drake with the 6
Let's go let's get it, I'm committed
It's survival of the fittest and I'll only take a minute
Life is short, I compare it to a midget
Shovel in the trunk of the '06 Civic
I'm with it, I'm with it
There's no way out
You're stuck in the mud, snow, rain, drought
Like tits no bra, you should go hang out
Body like a shotgun, just don't bang out

Let's start a fire baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady

Let's start a fire, baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady

Don't try to fight it
I know you like it yeah, yeah, yeah
Taking over like a virus
Let's start a riot yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't try to fight it
I know you like it yeah, yeah, yeah
Taking over like a virus
Let's start a riot yeah, yeah, yeah

Black or white, you are my type
Like a keyboard, baby, you earned your stripes
I'm on your bike, we ride together
Soulmates so we'll die together
Jungle fever, a firm believer
Lacking on rest but I'm still a dreamer
We can show out like Martin, Gina
Offer a ring and I'll say yes eager

Let's start a fire baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady

Let's start a fire baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady

Black or white
You are my type
Like a keyboard, baby
You earned your stripes

Black or white
You are my type
Like a keyboard, baby
You earned your stripes, yeah

Don't try to fight it
I know you like it yeah, yeah, yeah
Taking over like a virus
Let's start a riot yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't try to fight it
I know you like it yeah, yeah, yeah
Taking over like a virus
Let's start a riot yeah, yeah, yeah

Love, love, love, love

I said no matter what color
You are my lover
I, I will do whatever 'cause I love you

Yeah, yeah, no matter what color
You are my lover
I, I will do whatever 'cause I love you, yeah

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
Shit

// Lazy //

Yeah
Yeah

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy

You're lazy
Ketchup, mustard
Yeah, uh

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy

Yeah
You're lazy
Ketchup, mustard

Went out to dinner, he made me pay the bill
He said he left his wallet then I said ew
I lost my appetite, that boy here is broken, yeah
He said he had a car but then it got stolen
I can't believe this man still live with his mama
When we FaceTime he always wearing pajamas

He sleep until 3PM, that nigga lazy
He must be crazy, he think we havin' babies (No)

Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)
Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)
Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)
Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)

My best friend asked me why I keep giving you chances
Must be your looks 'cause you ain't even romantic
It's funny how I act like I ain't got options
Boy, I ain't kiddin', put you up for adoption
I wear my hair down hoping you see a difference
But you're too busy eating, piling up dishes

He sleep until 3PM, that nigga lazy
He must be crazy, he think we havin' babies

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy
This ain't gon' work if you don't work
(You're lazy)
Ketchup, mustard
Yeah, uh

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy
Yeah
You're lazy
Ketchup, mustard

I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time

Your schedule is different than mine
I love money so I got no free time
You say I need to prioritize but
Understand that my career's on the line
It's like you wanted me to resign, but
I work hard 'cause I'm my mama's design
You know I got a lot on my plate
So tell me, are you willing to wait for me?

I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time

I know I never pick up your calls, but
I'd rather text, I guess that's one of my flaws
I got problems that I'm willing to solve
Maybe we can take a trip to the mall
You say I build invisible walls but
I promise that I'll be more involved
You know I got a lot on my plate
So tell me, are you willing to wait for me?

I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time
