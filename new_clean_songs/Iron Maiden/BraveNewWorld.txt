Album: BraveNewWorld

// The Wicker Man //

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

// Ghost Of The Navigator //

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

// Brave New World //

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your soul to this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

// Blood Brothers //

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

// The Mercenary //

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus snap in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain

// Dream Of Mirrors //

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence
Lost, a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

// The Fallen Angel //

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a Devil to get ready and take over your mind

You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

// The Nomad //

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells

No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

// Out Of The Silent Planet //

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are

// The Thin Line Between Love And Hate //

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost

At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate
