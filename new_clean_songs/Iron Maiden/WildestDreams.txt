// Pass The Jam //

I don't care
They're crazy
Said pass the jam, would you
Awfully kind of you
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this

Gazing at the open door
Just what lays behind
Thinking what I'm looking for
Say what's on my mind

Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt of shame
And now I can redeem myself
I just don't care

The words I'm singing they're just right
That's better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane

I just don't care
I just don't care

Caesar had some jam with tea
But Brutus wasn't kind
Wasn't strawberries that were red
He wasn't cutting bread

You pass the jam
And so he slammed the tea
The only bugger here to me
Is in the conservatory

Yeah, alright

Yes, but still over there
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt and shame
I can't redeem myself
I just don't care

Staring at the silver spoon
Take it from your mouth
Take it from the jam jar
Turn and face the south, yeah

Now face the north
And the east
And the west
And the setting sun

Yeah

Still burning on in the night
Where's the sun at midnight
Say it's gone
Where's the moon at dawn
It carries on
And on
It never ends

To the land of nevermore
Where time began
Where the man still stands
And the edge, at the end
Never know that I sang
You'll all know it's the right place
In time, well it is

The words I'm singing
That's just right
They're better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane

Pass the jam
Pass the jam
Pass the fuckin' jam
Please

Next up I'll scream
I will

I warned you

I'm going home now

Oh my goodness, that must be the first jam we've had in years!

[Repeat until the end:]
I say pass the jam, would you

// Blood Brothers (Orchestral Mix) //

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are re-opening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

// The Nomad (Rock Mix) //

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend your own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius
