Album: FromHereToEternity

// From Here To Eternity //

She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the Beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Yes, ah, yeah, like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr. Murray

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity

"Get on your M11, get on your bikes!"

Ha ha ha ha ha!

// I Can't See My Feelings //

I can't see my feelings
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings
Up in the pale moonlight

I can't see my feelings
Keeping me high
I just keep on reeling
Honey please tell me why

I can't stand there dreaming
All of the time
Music sends a feeling
Up in the pale moonlight

// Roll Over Vic Vella //

...well.

Oh yeah?

Went down ten feet, got a JCB from the road 'cause my other one wouldn't reach. Dug it out... after ten or fifteen minutes he went back to the hole to check the height... full of water! Must have come from the river, eh?

Dunno...someone must have pissed in it.

Say well, fucking big piss... somebody did.

Something you were doing down the

Trying to feed it through the ground, it's like a well. About three feet deep So I....that's right, fucking John shit himself. There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said, "I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local MP
He's a Maltese man and he's mowing the lawn my way
Roll over Vic Vella, give me more bales of hay

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you mow that lawn my way

Early in the morning I'm giving you a warning

Don't you step on my tractor blades
Hey devil he's on the fiddle
and he ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Vic Vella, tell the tax man the bad news

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you tell the tax man the news

You want to buy a truck and need a new VCR

Vic he gonna say he knows where they are
Roll over Vic Vella, I see that panda-car

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play that game with me

// No Prayer For The Dying (Live) //

There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God, give me the answer to my life
God, give me the answer to my dreams
God, give me the answer to my prayers
God, give me the answer to my being

// Public Enema Number One (Live) //

Ah ha!

When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
Mm, what ho!
