// Priest Of Sodom //

The blackened city calls out
Enter the temple of sin
You must enter the temple of sin
Contorted sinners beckon
Join our twisted rites
You must join our twisted rites
The priests eyes gleam
Blood on their scepters of flesh
There is blood on their scepters of flesh
The nubile virgin bows
Await the piercing thrust
She awaits the piercing thrust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Praise the gods of sin
Her walls are burning
Grinding the staff of the priest
Sluts grinding the staff of the priests
The congregation
Revel in sins of the flesh
They revel in sins of the flesh
Whores from the temple
Serving shamanic desire
They are serving shamanic desire
Deviant bodies writhing
Slick with the fluids of lust
They are slick with the fluids of lust
Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure
Statues of demons glisten with sweat
The orgy intensifies, violence begins
Flagellate sluts with serpentine whips
They raise their blades to throats of their men
Climax approaches and the blood will spill
Sexual sacrifice, mutilation and death
Murder
Priests of Sodom
Priests of Sodom
Priests of Sodom
Priests, of, Sodom!

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure

// Scalding Hail //

Flying chunks of hot debris rushing through the air
Vapors causing blisters, eyes blinded by the glare
Clouds that shower death, hell falling from the sky
Searing rain of molten rock, flesh begins to fry
Burning fragments, steaming stones tearing through my skin
Lodging near my organs, I'm burning from within
Parts of human bodies lay strewn on the ground
Survivors holding bleeding ears, deafened by the sound
Blackened heavens raining down a mountain's weight of rock on top of us
Churning earth has somehow come to life
Rapid combustion spewing magma cracks apart the crust
Tornadoes of caustic steam ravaging the earth
Scalding hail
Charred and battered victims crying to be saved
Falling on deaf ears, the earth is now our grave
Devastating torrents, acid drowns the land
No relief from scalding hail burning like a brand
People shrieking a they die, pounded by the hail
Splintered shards, heated rock stabbing like a nail
Millions have been slaughtered as the boiling torrents falls
Apocalyptic storm, judgment for us all
Scalding hail

// To Decompose //

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
He starts with the draining of liquid mass
His victims lie helpless and wide awake
Bodies are shriveled to skeletal form
To decompose
Victims die helpless while siphoned wake
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Bone matter is now removed from the skin
Collection of femurs used to impale
Scattered skulls with oozing brains left unfound
To decompose
Splitting the spines like he's done it before
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Morbid fascination with the dead bones blood brutally dissolved
Constant threat of killing all he sees
Revenge always gets involved
Morbid inclination warps his mind
Terror saturates his eyes
Foreseen decimation feeds his mind
Starving for the next attack
Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Lefts to be one with the dirt again
It all will end in the dirt again
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again
Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

// A Cauldron Of Hate //

My deep aversions
Building for years
Smoldering contempt internally burns
Dark introspection
Memories of scorn
Every slight an element of my simmering mind
Conflicting modules dictate my course
Feed me violence and my hatred will gorge
Resolve is growing
It must be done
And to this fury I'll be forced to succumb
Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Congealed revulsion
Benign fa√ßade
Roiling dreams of murder coursing through my skull
Savage visions
Nearing the brim
How long can contain this murderous rage
The mental picture
Becoming clear
Execration too extreme to bear
An execution
My plan of action
Advent of the day of blood no longer imagination
Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate
Terrorize
Realization that your final day has come
Your demise
Torturing you to death brings satisfaction to my livid brain
Die
I carve your flesh
Tear off your face
Retribution
This death your fate

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Rage

Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now

Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate

// Beheading And Burning //

Descend upon the village on a mission of death
Setting fire to their homes, attacking the men
We hear their women screaming as we hack off their heads
We show no fucking mercy to them, they will be annihilated
Targeting their necks a ruthless slaughter begins
Our axes swing with malice, blood drips from the blades
Utterly defeated, their forges put to rout
Our legions will pursue them until they have been eradicated
Burn
Torch their village
Burn
Reduce their feeble world to ash
Hack
Chop their heads off
Hack
Leave their headless bodies rotting
Massacre
Slay them all
Fire
Consumes their world
Massacre
They will die
Fire consumes their world, fire consumes their world
Their women have been raped
Their children are in chains
Defenses have been broken
Out conquest is complete
Take their leader captive, march hum to the square
His weaknesses exploited now we take his life
Demoralize the captives, their leader died on his knees
His severed head a trophy, his body feeds the pigs
Burn
Torch their village
Burn
Reduce their feeble world to ash
Hack
Chop their heads off
Hack
Leave their headless bodies rotting
Heads are falling
Corpses burn
We are coming
We bring death

// Evidence In The Furnace //

Stab the knife into the face and then wrench the blade inside
Murder this piece of shit
Scraps of flesh and severed bone are on the floor, these I must hide
Pounding the teeth
Commute bones
They never will know
Chop up the corpse
Congealing my crime
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
Secret cremation
You fucked with me and now any trace of you is completely gone
Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace
You cease to exist
Investigations fail to find a single useful clue
Their search is futile
Proof is destroyed in the searing heat, you melt away
No body case
There is no trace
Smoldering coals that once were your bones turn to ash
Your life is erased
There is no trace
You cease to exist but the search will go on, they cannot find
Their closure denied
Dead or alive
You're not the first and you won't be the last
To burn in my fires
Corpses will burn
Burn in my fires
Your corpse will burn

[Solo: Rob Barrett]

Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know
Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence
In the furnace

// Carnivorous Swarm //

Stain the sky Armageddon
Dormant mass now awakened
Summoned fury devastation
Enormous force annihilates
All that breathes shall be engulfed
Within its path everything dies
Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
Horde of the apocalypse arrives
Bombardment from oblivion
Invading legion gorges
Eradicate through infestation
Horde of the apocalypse destroys
Strike begins
It is a battle that is one sided
Swarm consumes
Droves assail
Congregation with aggressive nature
Swarm of death kills
Stain the sky Armageddon
Dormant mass now awakened
All that breathes shall be engulfed
Within its path everything dies
Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire
Horde of the apocalypse arrives
Bombardment from oblivion
Invading legion gorged
Eradicate through infesting
Horde of the apocalypse destroyed
Strike began
It was a battle that was one sided
Swarm consumed
Droves assailed
Congregation with aggressive nature
Swarm of death killed

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Ravage the earth
Conquer its life
Here to devour
Vicious attack
Ferociously savage beyond a primal desire

// Evisceration Plague //

Experimental pathogens, a devils design
The dark side of science breeds a weapon of war
Contagious killing and internal distress
Homicide or suicide will be the cause of death
Internal organs altered by the disease
Your brain disabled by the constant pain
Erratic actions lead my thoughts to the blade
I've lost control, I've lost control

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Stabbing compulsion overwhelms my mind
Terrorized screaming follows the thrust of my knife
I wrench the blade from the chest to the crotch
Organs and entrails fall to the ground

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague

Unable to be seen but with the visible effect
Virulent disease causing outbreaks of violence
They tear themselves apart, offal covers the ground
Viscera torn forcefully from the abdomen
Intestines slick with blood cannot escape my grip
Surgical incisions give way to frenzied carving
Delirium has taken hold, disembowelment is complete
Horror grips my mind, my entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands...
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Disease will spread and cover the world
Mass insanity, the end of our time
Scavengers will eat the remains of man
Our extinction was by our design

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague

// Shatter Their Bones //

Putrid foul zombie make their ghastly approach
A dreadful horrid feeling sets in.
Scrambling for weapons an attempt to defend
Against a gruesome horde of undead.
Shower them with fire make them burn in the flames
Some how they continue to march
Ravenous savages they'll tear you apart
They'll eat your fucking guts and your brains.
How do you kill what is not alive?
Break them down to stop their descent
Smash the bastards into the ground
And when they're down shatter their bones

[Solo: Rob Barrett]

Shower them with fire make them burn in the flames
Some how they continue to march
Ravenous savages they'll tear you apart
They'll eat your fucking guts and your brains.
How do you kill what is not alive?
Break them down to stop their descent
Smash the bastards into the ground
And when they're down shatter their bones

[Solo: Barrett/O'Brien]

Shower them with fire make them burn in the flames
Some how they continue to march
Ravenous savages they'll tear you apart
They'll eat your fucking guts and your brains.
Shatter their bones

// Carrion Sculpted Entity //

Carnage formed rebirth
A sickened lust of hatred
Damned to eternal plight
Obscene art alive through death
Crafted gore
Masterful slaughtering
Splatter soaked
Sinister demon incarnate
Maggots feast
Horrible putrid thing
One more piece
Scraped from bone born of decadence
Created from decay
Cold inncards used for torture
Prey sought by a twisted beast
Pray to hell no one survives
Black blood horror
Normalcy won't return
Guts of the dead
Severed hearts pulsate stagnant pus
Carves dying flesh
Brutal filth reeks of rot
Layered disgust
Undead pawn made to decimate

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Carrion sculpted entity
Rancid soul
Lives again immortal
Stench repulsive
Half eaten vultures picked apart
Molded scum
Archaic implements
Insanity
Covets pain vile anomaly
Carnage formed rebirth
A sickened lust of hatred
Damned to eternal plight
Obscene art alive through death
Living in this state uncontrolled
Vengeful mutant evil creature
Unrelenting thirst for blood
Dying by the way nightmares told
Murder murder murder murderer
Black blood horror guts of the dead
Art that's living never dying
Unrelenting thirst for blood
Carrion sculpted entity

// Unnatural //

Madness overwhelming
Excruciating pain
My brain aches for release
I will suffer until I kill
Weapons have been gathered now I seek my prey
Senses heightened as I stalk
Distorted means of pleasure
Taking human life
Uncontrolled obsession
Murder is my vice
Aberrant compulsions
Kill for peace of mind
My consuming passion
Murderous appetite
Ferociously attacking
Stabbing all I see
Blood is spraying on my face
Hands are punctured in defense
Brutally dismembered
Parts are growing cold
A natural high achieved by death
Perverted and twisted
Bizarre thoughts are my norm
It is my nature to murder
If I stop I know I will die

[Solo: Erik Rutan]

// Skewered From Ear To Eye //

Sharpen the pick
To pierce the skull through the ear
Stab at an angle
Cranial transfixion, hearing and vision terminated by the penetration
Skewered from ear to eye
Launching the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real
Struggle with death
In shock you grasp at the air
Senses deprived
Cerebral cessation, mental division created by the penetration
Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real
Boring through the brain, eye impaled upon the point
Steel spears crisscross your grey matter
Puncturing the eardrum and the blood begins to ooze
Red blooms grace the dying head
Auditory nerve is severed
Labyrinth destroyed
You are rendered deaf and blind
Seconds before death
On a spit
Your head will burn
Charring flesh
Brain tissue congeals
Crack the skull
Open wide
Scoop it out
I consume your mind

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Eating the brain
To gain the knowledge of death
You are inside
Psychic absorption, hearing and vision
Are now mine through this appropriation
Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left blind
Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real.

// Skull Fragment Armor //

Adversaries will cower
In the wake of his appearance
Clad with remains of their friends

Bludgeoning them with power
As they strain to make a defense
The bringer of death descends

Skull fragment armor
It's a trophy of war

Pieces of cleft craniums shield the gore

Towering clad in bone
Cranial plate mail spattered
With the blood and brains of the foe

Murdering dozens alone
Countless skeletons shattered
Rivers of fresh blood will flow

Skull fragment armor
Designed by the cruel

Decimation is the only rule

Hewing through a frightened face
His rotting visage gleaming
Demented lust for violence and pain

Impervious to counter-strikes
He mangles without feeling
Only satisfied when all he sees are slain

Another head collapses
His spiked club dripping brain
Torrents of blood are gushing from the hole

Towering over corpses
Nothing here still living
He begins to scavenge, a killer with no soul

Skull fragment armor
Is a trophy of war

Pieces of cleft craniums shield the gore
