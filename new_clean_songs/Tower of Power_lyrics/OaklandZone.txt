// Give Me Your Love //

Listen
From the day we met you had me on the run
I tried to fight it but it's about to take it's toll
I can't stop it now I think I found the groove
One more night and I'll make my move

See lady luck came on my side
It's a hard knock line strung with some vibe
No matter what you'll say or do
I can't live my life without you

Give me some satisfaction
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)
Early in the morning
You had my pony jonnin'
I need your love (I need your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Listen
I can't go to work without a taste of your love
I never hold or take, leads me right back home
It might sound strange but I'm addicted to your smile
And the way you move girl it drives me wild yeah

Never know it's wrong till want so bad
When the want is right I think the wrong can't be bad
No matter what you put me through
I want to spend my life with you

Give me some satisfaction
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)
Early in the morning
You got my pony jonnin'
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Give me some satisfaction
Just to hear of your action
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)
Early in the morning
You got my pony jonnin'
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Hey, come on! hey
Gimme your love, I want your love

I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

Gimme gimme gimme your love...

I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)
I want your love (I want your love)
Gimme your love (gimme your love)

// Pocketful Of Soul //

I gotta get going, I gotta get gone
I'm one step away from home and one step to be gone
I gotta get moving, the message is clear
The future is clouded down here

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know I can depend on just one thing

I gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here

I gotta get serious, I can't be a clown
Gotta give up a soul cut cause it's time to get down
I gotta get in there go figure it out
That's what it's all about

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know it's up to me whenever I sink or swim

I gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know I can depend on just one thing

Gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here

You could be in New York City, or even in Paris France

But when you're in the Oakland Zone you do it with a lot of funk, y'all
You might be in turmoil or total serenity
But when you're in the Oakland Zone, you be listenin' to R and B

But when you're in the Oakland Zone, at least you're gonna catch a groove, y'all
You might be an old geezer, or you might be a real young punk
But when you're in the Oakland Zone you're really gonna funk it up... ooh!

// Life Is What You Make It //

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Life's a bowl of cherries
Just waiting there for you
But they may not taste as sweet
As you expect them too

The grass is always greener
On the other side of the room
But there's one thing to remember
When the rose has lost it's bloom

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Life can disappoint you
When you get too selective
It can bring you down tonight
It's a question of perspective

One mans got a meal
While the other ain't got enough
You can't take it with you
When it's all said and done

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Make it funky, make it funky, make it funky...
Make it funky, get down funky you'll...

If you take it all for granted
It might not work out that way
Now I understand it
What mama used to say

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Make it funky, make it funky, make it funky...
