// Crazy For You //

I used to feel
So very sane
So very clear
Within my brain
I never was the kind of guy
Who would ever lose it
Oh, no

But when you messed
With my mind
You know I crossed
That invisible line
And now I'm trippin' all the time
Because I'm flippin'
All the out

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
You got me going

I used to be
So down to earth
So rational
For what its worth
I never was the kind of guy
Who could ever get on
On 's way out

The things you do
Drive me berserk
And I can see
It'll take some work
I'm diggin' what you do to me
Still I'm wiggin'
Oh way down, oh

You got me going crazy
Going crazy

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
Got me going crazy, yeah, yeah

I know why
I want you so much
You got that look
And you got the touch
There's nothing left to prove
Girl you move me
And you groove me

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
...

Crazy, crazy babe
(Crazy for you)
Yeah, going crazy
(Crazy for you)

// Unconditional Love //

I used to be a part time lover
Just droppin' by every once in a while
I had to do it undercover, yes I did
That was just my style

Now I have the strangest feeling
This love has really got me reeling
Everything we do is together
This love I have for you is forever, oh

Unconditional love, unconditional
That is what I have for you
Here's my position of love, unconditional
Love is what I have for you

Never cared about tomorrow
I only thought about what I could get today
I left behind a trail of sorrow, mmm
That was just my way

Still it didn't even come close
To fillin' up that hole in my soul
Now I had a change of heart
Girl I hope that we will never part

You love me, I love you
And that's the way it's s'posed to be
Together forever from now until eternity

Unconditional love, unconditional
That is what I have for you
Here's my position of love, unconditional
Love is what I have for you
...
