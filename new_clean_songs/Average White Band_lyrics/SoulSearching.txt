Album: SoulSearching

// Love Your Life //

I believe there's no place for despair
Sometimes your heart is heavy, beware
If you feel that you're ready to give up, keep on
Don't have to live up to what others expect of you
There's something new in every situation
So much to laugh about, so much to enjoy
The power of love
Help from above will only come
If we help ourselves
Wanna tell you

Love your life, give it all you got
Love your life, it's a blessing
Love your life
Love your life
Love your life (life) it's a blessing
Don't heed nobody, no, no

When I get down, feel like I wanna quit
I believe I got the strength to handle it
Make every moment big as it can be
There is only one thing to do
So you got to

Love your life, give it all you got
Love your life, it's a blessing
Love your life
Love your life
Love your life it's a blessing
Don't heed nobody, no, no

Love your life, yeah
Love your life, love your life right
Love your life, yeah, yeah
You gotta love your life

// I'm The One //

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

Baby, what I've seen, I like a lot
Nothin' gonna change my mind
You're the one
Now I wanna find what else you got
Come on 'cause I know
You're the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

No pushin', no shovin'
Gonna get me a loving that easy
The slower I go there's a chance that you might get away
Gotta say

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I've been watching you from day to day
Thinkin' to myself, "She's the one"
Girl, need nobody else, you say to me
Amen, you got hunch
She's the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I've seen it from a distance
That there's no existence to my eyes
(No, no, no)
Your smile kinda tells me
That I might just be the one for you

I'm the one
I'm the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I...
I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

// A Love Of Your Own //

The sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
The longer it takes, the better you come to know
A love of your own

Don't you be afraid to give your heart
Never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid, walk right on in
The door is standing open, you know I'm always hoping
Oh, hoping

The sooner you give, the sooner you get to have
A love of your own
As far as you go, you're never too far behind
A love of your own

Don't you be afraid to shoot the moon
You never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid to change your tune
The offer's always open, you know I'm always hoping
You know I'm always hoping for

A love of my own to shelter me from the cold
A love of my own, oh
A love of my own, the traffic will always pale
A love of my own, oh yes, it will
A love of my own, you're never too far behind
A love of your own, you never know
Try it, try it

A love of my own to shelter me from the cold
A love of my own, it's not real
A love of my own, traffic will always pale
A love of my own
A love of my own, I'm never too far behind
A love of your own, keep on looking 'til you find
A love of your own, a love of your own
A love of your own, ah
Never know 'til you try it
A love of your own
A love of your own
Love of your own
You got to keep looking 'til you find
A love of your own

// Queen Of My Soul //

I've loved you for as long as I remember

// Soul Searching //

Sometimes I'm lazy or maybe just holding back
Anyway it's hard to know the difference
Sometimes I get crazy
But if I do it doesn't matter, no no

What I'm doing is
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (lookin' inside)
Then it all adds up to what I'm trying to say, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

There's nothing here without trying, hope you get inspired
Got to find your imagination, oh
All it needs is one spark to kindle a fire within your body

So you see me really
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (lookin' inside)
Then it all adds up to what we have to say
No, it ain't no harm in trying anyway (anyway)

Sometimes we make music
Sometimes we make love
Still we keep on trying

Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday, baby (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way, baby (lookin' inside)
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper everyday (diggin' a little bit deeper everyday)
Then it all adds up to what we're trying to say
It's no use, no use crying to yourself, girl
No, and it ain't no harm in trying anyway

What we're doing is soul searching, searching, searching, searching, searching

// Goin' Home //

Goin' home, goin' home

Goin' home, goin' home
Take a little bit of funk, little bit of soul
And tell them that, I'm back gettin' ready to roll
Take a little horns, let them blow
Just put it on the game, goin' home

Ah, the guitar's calling

Ah yeah, goin' home
Ah yeah, goin' home
Ah yeah, goin' home
Goin' home
Goin' home
Goin' home
Ow!

Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?

Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?

// Everybody's Darling //

Diamonds and furs woah
Bleached or torn blue jeans
What you wear could never matter baby
(You shall blew it all)
Sad it don't last oh (this is sad)
To the point you stop it
Oh everyone is overboard for you

Ooh you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you go
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you run to when you are all alone
Ooh you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you show
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you turn to when you are all alone

Shining sunny (shining sunny)
Groovy on a Monday
Baby, don't you worry, no
'Cause you got it all in the palm of your hand

Everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you go
Oh you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you run to when you are all alone
Oh yes, you are everybody's darling, you know that you are
Sweet talk wherever you show
But you maybe everybody's darling
But where can you turn to when you are all alone

Oh sometimes you gonna be alone oh-oh
Everybody's darling (yeah, yes, yes you are)
If you wanna know by now baby
Ooh precious little darling
Oh that's what you are, something special to me baby
Ooh baby, gotta keep on trying
Don't make the blues get you down baby
Everybody's darling oh-oh oh-oh
Ye-aah
Precious little darling
Gotta keep on trying
You know you must make it keep on smiling
Ooh darling
Ooh darling, ooh, ooh

// Would You Stay //

Woman I can understand you
Although I love you to my soul
You got me so confused
That I don't know which way to turn

What can I do?
(I wish I knew)
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay (yeah, yeah)

Say you love me deeply
But you still got somebody else
Seems like distance
Circumstance is keeping us apart

I just don't know
And I'm wondering
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay

Little, little bit
You's a little bit too much
Makes you stop and think
As the best really, really come and go
Ooh

If only this (if only this)
If only that (only that)
If only thinking
I could hold you one more time

Would you stay?
Would you stay?

Ooh
If you came back
Would you stay? (Would you stay?)
Would you stay? (Would you stay?)
Stay

Ooh
This uncertainty is killing me baby
I gotta know
Would you stay? Yeah
And hold me

You gotta let me know
Would you really
Would you stay, stay, stay
I wanna know, I gotta know baby
If you came back baby
Would you stay?
Stay

// Sunny Days (Make Me Think Of You) //

I wrote a song to sing you
But I couldn't find the right words
When I tried to call you
There was no reply
So I had to keep on hoping
We might meet again somewhere (where)

In this world as you drift into my sweet mind
I wonder as the daylight fades
And the nights grow colder without you
Will I find your kind of love again
Until then

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think...

You have a way about you
That is difficult to replace
Reaching out to find you
If you hear this song
You will understand what I'm saying
Could it be just like it was before
Once again

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you

Could it be just like it was before?
Once again baby

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Every little thing you do

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Ooh every little thing you do girl yeah

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Ooh my baby

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think...

Makes me think of you...
