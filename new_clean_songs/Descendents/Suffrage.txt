// On You //

LIE – SPIN – REPEAT...
LIE – SPIN – REPEAT...
LIE – SPIN – REPEAT...
BELIEVE

You're looking for a goat to scape
A different face you're supposed to hate
Sympathy for your plight only goes so far
To see the lie within belief
in your alternative reality
Open up your eyes, don't fall in line no more

I'd like to thank you for your blind acceptance of the fantasy
This one's on you

What makes you think it's just a game?
And if you win, you got it made?
So how is all that winning treating you so far?
Straight out of 1984
They told you lies, then you wanted more
2+2 isn't 5, but you just don't care

I'd like to thank you for your loyal chanting of the brand, way to go
This one's on you

And if you ask me
You can't handle the truth
I'm willing to hear your side, but
No dice if you're never gonna give me proof

I'd like to thank you for your loyal chanting of the brand, yeah
I'd like to thank you for your vote against your own self-interest
I'd like to thank you, all the oxymorons of false reality
This one's on you
This one's on you
This one's on you, on you, ON YOU

// Hindsight 2020 //

Hindsight 2020 - it's crystal clear
Hindsight 2020 - the last four years
We the people made a mistake

Hindsight 2020 – you gotta admit
Hindsight 2020 - he's full of shit
We - the people - made a mistake

Do you deny?
You're gonna deny
You gotta deny, you're in denial
You bought it every time

#MAGA MAGA – what a fucking joke
But #MAGA, for real, with your 2020 vote
For we the people, it's not too late

Bernie got burned, so it's all up to Joe
Can he kick cheeto's ass? Nobody knows
A lotta people say, I don't care who it is
A fucking bum on the corner would be better than our fake prez

We - the people - made a mistake

Do you deny?
You're gonna deny
You gotta deny, you're in denial
You bought it every time
