// No Man Is An Island //

No man is an island
No man stands alone
Each man has a brother
And remember
Each man's dream has a road

Now we need one another ooh yes
And we all try to be friends
Each man has a brother
And a each man has a friend

You can live in this world all by yourself
In this world all by yourself
No nonoooo you can't make it alone
And just as sure as you try to make it by yourself
You gonna wake up and find you gonna need somebody else

No man is an island
No man stands alone
Each man has has brother
And remember
Each man's dream has a road

// Your Love Is Amazing //

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love is amazing
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love is amazing

You made the wanderer like me
Into what I'm supposed to be
Could be sadness, right or wrong
You beat my weakness and make me strong
I'm gonna love you the whole night true
'Cause no one never does the things you do

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing

With nothing to cling to, day and night
Nothing for me seems to go right
Darling, you stretch out your hands
An' make me a better man (Yeah)
I'm gonna love you the whole night true
'Cause no one never does the things you do

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing (Oh-oh)
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing

Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing (Oh-oh-oh)
Darling (Hu-hu, whee)
Your love's amazing

// Black Magic Woman //

I got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
I've got a black magic woman
Got me so blind, I can't see, well
That she's a black magic woman
She's trying to make a devil out of me

You turn your back on me, baby, well
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Stop messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me, baby, 'cause
You might just wake up my magic sticks, well
...

Got your spell on me, baby
Got your spell on me, baby
You've got your spell on me, baby
Turnin' my heart into stone
I need you so bad
Magic woman I can't leave you alone

Ah... yeah
I just, I just, I just, just
Can't leave you alone
Got your spell on me, baby
Got your spell, baby

// Everybody's Talking At Me //

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of their voice
People stopping staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Sailing of the North East wind
Sailing on summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of their voice
People stopping staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Sailing of the North East wind
Sailing on summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone
