// Birds //

Lover, there will be another one
Ooh lover, over you, beneath the sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come
Today

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

Nestle in my arms, my little one
A special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come
Today, yeah

When you see my fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
Oh and show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
Oh and show you the way to go
It's over
It's over
Can't you see it's all over?

// Do The Dirt //

Listen people, come on, listen good
We're gonna dance, gonna do you some good
You've got to pull off your shoes
You've got to pull off your shirt

Relax yourself
Getting ready to do the dirt
Doing the dirt (dirt)
You've got to watch me work (work)

You've got to stretch your legs as far as you can
Stretch your legs now, so your knees won't bend
You've got to bend your hips, you've got to bend it good
Shuffle your arms, like I know would
Doing the dirt, doing the dirty, dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty now, get nasty

You've got to step some to the left
You've got to step some to the right
Feels so good now, you can do it all night

Relax yourself
Getting ready to do the dirt
Doing the dirt (dirt)
You've got to watch me work (work)
...

I know you can do it now
You've got to bend your hips, you've got to bend it good
You've got to shuffle your arms, like I know would
...

// Gettin' Funkier All The Time //

Gettin' funky, gettin' funky all the time
Funky music is so very hard to find

If you feel funky take your shirt off
Keep it funky, keep it funky on the line

Yeah, keep it funky, keep it funky all the time
I told you get naked, here we go y'all, hooaa yeah

Gettin' funky, gettin' funky all the time
Funky music, it's so very hard to find
