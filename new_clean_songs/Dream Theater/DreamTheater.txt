// The Enemy Inside //

Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain as real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Is staring at me crying

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
And shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
Overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying!

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden, I'm a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
Can bring it back again

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

// The Looking Glass //

I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds
Than be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn't matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away
Some will not admit that fifteen minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don't see you walking on the moon

You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame

You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise

You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass

// The Bigger Picture //

Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise
Moving in and out of reach

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain
And I'll reach the water's edge

Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my eyes when I can't see
Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture

Like a moth burned by the fire
And driven to the flame
(Prophecies' a blessing and a curse)
I must bare this cross alone
There's no one else to blame

With each treasure found
Another shipwreck's washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course

Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my eyes when I can't see
Shed your light on me (shed your light on me)
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture

What if caught in a moment
I get lost and can't find my way?
What if all along I was wrong
In every turn, in every way?

Would you talk me off the ledge
Or let me take the fall?
Better to try and fail
Than to never try at all!

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but don't believe

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream that's all too real
A stare as cold as steel

I've listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
I've looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
I've taken blood from every stone
And traveled every road!

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home

// Behind The Veil //

What would possess you to justify
Such dark and twisted ways?
What kind of monster would come to feast
When the devil shows his face?

What does it take for life to change
And a mind to lose control?
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame
After all the lies you told

I am finding courage in my darkest hour
I am bent, not broken
Calling out

Someone save me, look behind the veil
Please don't walk away!
Someone save me, bring me home tonight
I can't face another day!

Can you see the stranger
Hiding in plain sight?
Feeding on the chaos
When the lightning strikes

There's no redemption
There's no being saved
There's no salvation
For a soul depraved

You are finding promise in your finest hour
You are bent, not broken
Calling out

Someone save me, look behind the veil
Please don't walk away!
Someone save me, bring me home tonight
I can't face another day!

Someone save me, look behind the veil
Please don't walk away!
Someone save me, bring me home tonight
I can't face another day!

// Surrender To Reason //

In moments of pain
Where heart and mind collide
Self reflection helps me decide
I believe the sacrifices in life
Give more than they take

Visions flowing slowly shedding light
Memories swimming in the sea of time
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place
That with which we struggle through we've learned to embrace

Love, show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow
Grace, lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Life gives you brighter days
Through sacrifices made
My spirit travels like the wind and waves
My heart and mind unite
Mistakes resolved give sight
The river's currents slowly turns the stone

Love, show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrow
Grace, lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels
Help me find my strength
Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angels
Let love show the way
Let grace be the way
Surrender to reason

// Along For The Ride //

At this moment words fail me
And my vision's unclear
Blind to the truth
Like hands reaching out in the darkness

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

Through the gift of surrender
I'm embracing the fight
Breaking the code
There's clarity on the horizon

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

I will not live under a shadow of fear
Never be crippled by chaos and doubt
Fall prey to your madness

I am not shattered
Out of the ashes I rise
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith
Finding hope in our hopeless lives

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride

I can't stop the world from turning around
Or the pull of the moon on the tide
But I don't believe that we're in this alone
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride
I believe we're along for the ride

[I. Paradoxe de la Lumi√®re Noire]

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this question
Look deep inside
Deliver a true confession
What are you willing to live for?

Consider this question
Open your eyes
Examine your own reflection
What are you willing to die for?

When your backs' against the wall
And the times uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened
What are you willing to kill for?

We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand

The bridges we build to connect
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanity

Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believing
Capture it all in a final act of faith!

We seek to understand
We cry with head in hand

A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far away

[III. The Embracing Circle]

[Instrumental]

[IV. The Pursuit Of Truth]

Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life

A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students
Vengeance for a crime

Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the praise
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and fame

Noble and brave
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory

[V. Surrender, Trust & Passion]

To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light
You can face the darkest days

If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights
You will never be alone

Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning bright
Until you struggle through the dark
You'll never know that you're alive

Never know
Never know
You'll never know
Never know
Never know
Never know
