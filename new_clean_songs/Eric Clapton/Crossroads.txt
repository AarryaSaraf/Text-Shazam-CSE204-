Album: Crossroads

// After Midnight //

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to chug-a-lug and shout
We're going to stimulate some action
We're going to get some satisfaction
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to cause talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to because talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight

// Blues Power //

Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock 'n' roll
Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul
There ain't no need for me to be a wallflower
'Cause now I'm living on blues power

I knew all the time but now I'm gonna let you know:
I'm gonna keep on rocking, no matter if it's fast or slow
Ain't gonna stop until the twenty-fifth hour
'Cause now I'm living on blues power

Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock 'n' roll
Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul
There ain't no need for me to be a wallflower
'Cause now I'm living on blues power

Talking to you, now
The boogie's gonna pull me through
Keep on, keep on, keep on keeping on
Keep on keeping on, keep on keeping on

// Let It Rain //

The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me
The sun could never thaw away
The bliss that lays around me

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun
Until I found the way to love
It's harder said than done

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Now I know the secret
There is nothing that I lack
If I give my love to you
You'll surely give it back

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

// Motherless Children //

Motherless children have a hard time when mother is dead, lord
Motherless children have a hard time when mother is dead, lord
They don't have anywhere to go
Wandering around from door to door
Nobody treats you like a mother will when your mother is dead, lord

Father will do the best he can when your mother is dead, lord
Father will do the best he can when your mother is dead, lord
Father will do the best he can
So many things a father can't understand
Nobody treats you like a mother will when your mother is dead, lord

Sister will do the best she can when your mother is dead, lord
Sister will do the best she can when your mother is dead, lord
Sister will do the best she can
So many things a sister can't understand
Nobody treats you like a mother will when your mother is dead

When your mother is dead, when your mother is dead
When your mother is dead, Lord, when your mother is dead

// Better Make It Through Today //

Life is what you make it
That's what the people say
And if I can't make it through tomorrow
I'd better make it through today

I have had my share of troubles
It's nothing new to me
When I look around me
All I see is misery

Life is what you make it
At least that's what the people say
And if we can't make it through tomorrow
We'd better make it through today, through today
Through today

// I Shot The Sheriff //

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows."
He said, "Kill it before it grows."
I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no

// Let It Grow //

Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Looking for a reason to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

// The Sky Is Crying //

The sky is crying
Look at the tears rolling down the streets
The sky is crying
Look at the tears rolling down the streets
I looked out my window
The rain was falling down in sheets

My baby left me this morning
Lord knows I don't know the reason why
My baby left me this morning
I don't know the reason why
And every time I think about it
I hang my head and cry

The sun is shining
Although it's raining in my heart
The sun is shining
Although it's raining in my heart
I love my baby
I hate to see us part

// Sign Language //

You speak to me in sign language
As I'm eating a sandwich in a small cafe
At a quarter to three

But I can't respond to your sign language
You're taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?

'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
This is my story, still I'm still there
Does she know I still care?

Link Wray was playing on a jukebox, I was paying
For the words I was saying, so misunderstood
He didn't do me no good

You speak to me in sign language
As I'm eating a sandwich in a small cafe
At a quarter to three

'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
This is my story, still I'm still there
Does she know I still care?

// Hello Old Friend //

As I am strolling down the garden path
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek

Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again
Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again

I saw you walking underneath the stars
I couldn't stop 'cause I was in a car
I'm sure the distance wouldn't be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are

Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again
Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again

An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I couldn't say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name

Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again
Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again

Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again
Hello old friend
It's really good to see you once again

// Double Trouble //

Lay awake at night
Oh so low, just so troubled
Cannot get a job
Laid off and I am having double trouble

Hey hey, to make you have got to try
Baby, that is no lie
Some of this generation is millionaires
I cannot even keep decent clothes to wear

Laugh at me walking
And I have no place to go
Bad luck and trouble has taken me
I have no money to show

Hey hey, to make you have got to try
Baby, that is no lie
Some of this generation is millionaires
I cannot even keep decent clothes to wear

Lay awake at night
Oh so low, just so troubled
Cannot get a job
Laid off and I am having double trouble

// Cocaine //

If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you wanna get down, down on the ground
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If you got bad news, you wanna kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done and you wanna ride on
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone and you wanna ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

// Wonderful Tonight //

It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."

// Lay Down Sally //

There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

// Mean Old Frisco //

Well that mean old dirty Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe
Mean old Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe
You know they take my girl away
Lord, and blow back out on me

Well my mama, she done told me
And my papa told me too
Mama told me
And my papa told me too
A woman that gets in your face
Lord she ain't no friend for you

Well I'm goin' away now baby
And I won't be back until fall
Goin' away, baby
Lord, I won't be back till fall
If I don't come back by then
Lord, I won't be back at all

[Alternate verse:]
Well I'm goin' away baby
And your cryin' won't make me stay
Goin' away baby
And your cryin' won't make me stay
Well the more you cry, little girl
If anything you'll drive me away

Well that mean old dirty Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe
Mean old Frisco
And that low down Santa Fe
Gonna take my gal away
Lord, and blow back out on me

// If I Don't Be There By Morning //

Blue sky upon the horizon
Private eye is on my trail
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have spent the night in jail

I've been running from Memphis to LA
Had an appointment set sometime for today
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have gone the other way

Finding my way back to you girl
Lonely and blue and mistreated too
Sometimes I think of you girl
Is it true that you think of me too?

I got a woman living in LA
I got a woman waiting for my pay
And if I don't be there by morning
Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray

Blue sky upon the horizon
Private eye is on my trail
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have spent the night in jail

I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill
I left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still
If I don't be there by morning
You know that I, I never will

// Promises //

I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me

You cause a commotion when you come to town
You give 'em a smile and they melt
Having lovers and friends is all good and fine
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine

La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I don't care what you do at night
Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights
I'm gonna leave you alone, I'll just let it be
I don't love you and you don't love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?

I tried to love you for years upon years
You refuse to take me for real
It's time you saw what I want you to see
And I'd still love you if you'd just love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?

// I Can't Stand It //

You've been told
So maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold
Maybe it's time that you earned

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

I'll explain
I feel like I'm being used
Make it plain
So you don't get confused

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

It's time
Time for me to let you know
Ain't no crime
No crime to let your feelings show

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

// The Shape You're In //

I took my baby to see a show
She was telling me she didn't want to go
I said, "Come on girl, what's the matter with you?"
But I could tell by the smell that she'd had a few

I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in

Well, my little girl really loves that wine
Wine will do it to her most every time
If it's red or it's white or it's in between
She can drink more wine than I've ever seen

I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in

Now I'm not trying to get heavy with you
I'll mind my own business if you want me to
But I love you girl, I don't love no one else
I'm just telling you baby 'cause I've been there myself

I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in

// She's Waiting //

She's waiting for another love
She's waiting for another love

She's been waiting for another love
Someone that she can show into her heart
And when she finally finds a stronger love
Your whole world's gonna fall apart

She's waiting for another love
She's waiting for another love

You've been abusing her for far too long
Think you're a king and she's your pawn
Get ready now, 'cause pretty soon
She'll be gone and you'll be on your own

She's waiting for another love
She's waiting for another love

I see the hunger burning in her eye
Any fool could see there's something wrong
You keep pretending not to care
But I will hear you sing a different song

She's waiting for another love
She's waiting for another love

Waiting for another lover
Hoping for the time that she'll find another

// Miss You //

Don't change your mind
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder
I'm doing fine
If you decide to leave, I won't go under

You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone
I've got choices all around me
So I won't be spending too much time at home

Girl, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, baby
I can't forgive you
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby

No, don't say a word
I already heard that you don't love me
In your state of mind
I don't need to hear your side of the story

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go

Girl, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, baby
I can't forgive you
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby

I broke my back to make you happy
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care
If you think you're better off without me
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there

Girl, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, baby
I can't forgive you
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby

I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on
Gonna miss the air you breathe
I'm just not quite happy, baby
'Bout your crazy plans to leave

// Boom Boom //

Boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down
Knock you off of your feet
And take you home with me
Put you in my house
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love to see you strut
When you're walking to me
When you're talking to me
That knocks me out

Boom, boom, boom, boom
You know I like it like that
With your baby-talk
Oh and the way that you walk
You know it knocks me right down
Knocks me off of my feet

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How, how, how, how
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now, now, now, now

// Honey In Your Hips //

When I get out on the dancing floor
There ain't no stopping for an hour more
I go rocking up and down and around and round
I go reeling to the beat of that crazy sound

I can't stop, I want to kiss your pretty lips
'Cause I know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips

I can't stop my feet and I can't stop my hands
When I hear the sound of a rock 'n' roll band
Gotta rock, gotta roll, gonna jump and shout
Nobody better come and turn me out

I'm staying all night till I get my kicks
'Cause you know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips

I want you and you want me
We're gonna dance all night till we both feel free
We'll shake and we'll shimmy right across the floor
When it gets late, we'll dance out the door

You better get ready with your pretty lips
'Cause you know, pretty babe, you got honey in your hips

// Baby What's Wrong //

Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do

I can't help it, baby, if I'm acting strange
I'm just hoping, baby, I'm not going insane
Well baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do

I can't help it, baby, if I'm acting strange
I'm just hoping, baby, I'm not going insane
Well baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do

Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well now baby, honey what's wrong with you?
Well, you don't treat me, baby, like you used to do

// I Wish You Would //

Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back, baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

Walking and a-kissing late at night
I tell you now baby, I feel just right
Come now baby, whatcha trying to do?
Trying to love me and some other man, too

Come now baby, give me one more chance
You know I still love you, want to give you romance
Yeah romance, all night long, in my arms, whoa yeah

Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back, baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

You know baby that I love you so
You know, pretty baby, it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah, oh yeah

// I Ain't Got You //

I got a Maserati G.T
With snakeskin upholstery
I got a charge account at Goldblatt's
But I ain't got you

I got a closet full of clothes
But no matter where it goes
It keeps a ring in the nose
But I ain't got you

I got a tavern and a liquor store
I play the numbers, yeah, four forty-four
I got a mojo, yeah, don't you know
I'm all dressed up with no place to go

I got women to the right of me

For your love

To thrill you with delight
I'll give you diamonds bright
Double dates that will excite
To make you dream of me at night

For your love

For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

For your love

For your love

To thrill you with delight
I'll give you diamonds bright
Double dates that will excite
To make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

// Lonely Years //

Face is turning white
From the salt of all my tears
Face is turning white
From the salt of all my tears
Lost everything I had
I got to face five lonely years

Everybody got a trouble
I got to live with mine right now
Everybody got a trouble
I got to live with mine right now
I'm gonna take a little walk now, people
And I'll try to get along somehow

I'll be leaving right now, people
I got to stop now and figure out my time
I got to get a bus, people
I got to stop now and figure out my time
I believe with a feeling
I got to move on down the line

// All Your Love //

All your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby
Since I first met you baby, I never knew what I was missing

Hey, hey baby, hey, hey baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, oh, oh, baby
Since I first met you baby, never knew what I was missing

// Rambling On My Mind //

I got rambling
I got rambling all on my mind
I got rambling
I got rambling all on my mind
I hates to leave my baby
But she treats me so unkind

I got mean things
I got mean things all on my mind
I got mean things
I got mean things all on my mind
I hates to leave my baby
But she treats me so unkind

I'm going down to the station
Catch the fastest train I see
I'm going down to the station
Catch the fastest train I see
I got the blues 'bout miss so-and-so
And her son's got the blues about me

I got rambling
I got rambling all on my mind
I got rambling
I got rambling all on my mind
I hates to leave my baby
But she treats me so unkind

// Have You Ever Loved A Woman //

Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know
She bears another man's name

But you just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
You just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
But all the time you know
She belongs to your very best friend

Have you ever loved a woman
And you know you can't leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman
And you know you can't leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you
Won't let you wreck your best friend's home

// Wrapping Paper //

Wrapping paper in the gutter
Moving slowly as the wind on the sea
(Faces calling, waves moving)
In your picture on a wall of a house of old times
(Can you hear me) Can you hear me
(Can you hear me) Wandering sadly?

In the city, feeling pretty
Down and out and making love to you on the shore
(Ruined buildings, faces empty)
In the picture as I gaze ahead and don't see
(That they're calling) That they're calling
(That they're calling) Wandering sadly

Shattered windows, stairs to nowhere
(Hear you calling) Hear you calling
(Hear you calling) As I wander so sadly

Wish I knew what you'd done to me
Turned me on to things I never knew
It's all broken, weeds are growing
Wish I was going home to the house by the shore
(Where you loved me) Where you loved me
(Where you loved me) Loved me so sadly

Someday I'll get back, somehow I'll do it
I'll arrive there and you'll be there to meet me
(Walk together, tread the weeds down)
Kiss again in the picture on the wall
(Where I loved you) In the old house
(Where I loved you) Loved you so well

// I Feel Free //

Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

// Spoonful //

Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man

Men lie about it
Some of them cry about it
Some of them die about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

// Lawdy Mama //

Wanna go out, baby, to late at night
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Wanna go out, baby, to late at night
I got a real funny feeling
You're gonna treat your daddy right

Big-legged woman, come and hold my hand
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Big-legged woman, come and hold my hand
I got a real funny feeling
You wanna love another man

// Strange Brew //

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now what you gonna do?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew, strange brew

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

// Sunshine Of Your Love //

It's getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

// Tales Of Brave Ulysses //

You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses; how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

// Anyone For Tennis //

Twice upon a time in the valley of the tears
An auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading years
And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice

Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beer
While the beggars stain the pavements with fluorescent Christmas cheer
And the Bentley-driving guru is putting up his price

Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies

Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zoo
You can bring a bowl of rice and then a glass of water too
And fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice

Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

// White Room //

In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

// Crossroads //

I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
"Save me if you please"

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by

I'm going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
I am going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside

You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Believe I'm sinking down

// Badge //

Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle

// Presence Of The Lord //

I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
I know that I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord

I have finally found a place to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give
But soon I'll open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found a place to live
In the presence of the Lord
In the presence of the Lord

I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
I said everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord
In the color of the Lord

// Can't Find My Way Home //

Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key

But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own and leave your money at home
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
No I ain't done nothing wrong
Still I can't find my way home
No I ain't done nothing wrong
Still I can't find my way home

// Sleeping In The Ground //

I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground

Sleeping in the ground
Than to stay around here
If you're gonna put me down

Well, I give you all my money
Everything I own

Everything I own
Well, some day I'm gonna get lucky
And down the road you know I'm goin'

Well, I would rather see you
Sleeping in the ground

Sleeping in the ground
Than to stay around here
If you're gonna put me down

You know I give you all my money
Yeah little girl, everything I own
Well, I give you all my money
Everything I own
Well, today I'm gonna get lucky
And down the road you know I'm goin'

// Comin' Home //

Been out on the road 'bout six months too long
I want you so bad, I can hardly stand it
I'm so tired and I'm all alone
We'll soon be together and that's it
I'm comin' home to your love

Hitchhiking on the turnpike all day long
Nobody seemed to notice, they just pass me on by
To keep from going crazy, I got to sing my song
Got a whole lot of loving and baby that's why
I'm comin' home to your love

Coming home
Coming home
Coming home
Coming home

// Tell The Truth //

Tell the truth. Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth. Who's been fooling who?

There you sit there, looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by
You better come to terms with your fellow men soon, cause

The whole world is shaking now. Can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now. Can't you see it?

Tell the truth. Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth. Who's been fooling who?

It doesn't matter just who you are
Or where you're going or been

A new dawn is breaking now. Can't you see it?
I said see it, yeah, can't you see it?
Can't you see it, yeah, can't you see it?

Your time's coming, gonna be soon, boy

Tell the truth. Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth. Who's been fooling who?

// Roll It Over //

Go down easy and let me take my time
Go down easy and let me take my time
Rock me slow till I lose my mind

Roll it over, let's take it from behind
Roll it over, let's take it from behind
It's only love, God knows it ain't no crime

You don't know how much it means to be here in your arms
Roll it over
Roll it over

Go down easy and let me take my time
Go down easy and let me take my time
Rock me slow till I lose my mind

You don't know how much it means to be here in your arms
Roll it over

Roll it over, let's take it from behind
It's only love, God knows it ain't no crime

// Mean Old World //

This is a mean old world, try and live it by yourself
This is a mean old world, try and live it by yourself
Can't get the one you love, have to use somebody else

I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go
Guess you don't love me, babe, loving mister so-and-so

Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold?
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold?
I guess you don't love me, gonna pack my things and go

// Got To Get Better In A Little While //

Don't you know what is wrong with me?
Seeing things I don't want to see
Sniffing things that ain't no good for me
Going down fast, won't you say a prayer for me?

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday

Revolution all across the land
Just like Sly, you got to take a stand
Please don't hurt nobody, don't knock them down
Give them a helping hand to get off the ground

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday

Still one thing that you can do
Fall down on your knees and pray
I know the Lord's gonna answer you
Don't do it tomorrow, do it today

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday

// Evil //

It's a long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Call on your telephone
Something just ain't right
That's evil, evil is going on wrong
I want to warn you brother
You better watch your happy home

You make it to your house
Knock on the front door
Run 'round to the back
You'll catch him just before he goes
That's evil, evil is going on
I have warned you brother
You better watch your happy home

If you call on the telephone
And she answers long and slow
Grab the first thing smoking
And you have to haul her home

That's evil, evil is going on wrong
I have warned you brother
You better watch your happy home

// One More Chance //

Give me one more chance to make it up to you
Give me one more chance to show what I can do
Let me prove to you that my love is strong
Won't you come back home, that's where you belong

Oh baby, won't you give me one more chance?
Won't you give me one more chance?

Well, the sun won't shine and it refuse to rain
And I bang my heard, but I feel no pain
Then I tell myself that I could start anew
But I know darn well it all depends on you

Oh baby, won't you give me one more chance?
Won't you give me one more chance?

So if you hear this song, you might change your mind
And give a thought to me, I won't be hard to find
And I'll promise you to do the best I can
Change my evil ways and be your loving man

Oh baby, won't you give me one more chance?
Won't you give me one more chance?

So, give me one more chance to make it up to you
Give me one more chance to show what I can do
Let me prove to you that my love is strong
Won't you come back home, that's where you belong

Oh baby, won't you give me one more chance?
Won't you give me one more chance?
Won't you give me one more chance?

// Ain't That Lovin' You //

You don't know me, baby
Like I know myself
I just want to love you, baby
But you leave me on the shelf

Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
But you don't even know my name

Let me tell you something
I swear to God it's true
If you give your love to me
I'm gonna give it all to you, you know it's true

Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
But you don't even know my name

They may kill me, baby
And bury me like they do
My body will lie, but my spirit's gonna find
Only you

Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?
But you don't even know my name

// I Found A Love //

What would you do if I told you that I'm falling in love again?
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands
A way to make my heart beat faster
Is this heaven we're living in?
A way to make my life worth living
I've fallen in love again

I've got to ask you now, baby:

What would you say if I told you that I'm falling in love again?
I found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands

// Knockin' On Heaven's Door //

Ma, take this badge off of me
I can't use it any more
It is getting dark, too dark to see
Feel like I am knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door

Ma, take these guns away from me
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud following me
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door

Ma, take this badge off of me

It is getting dark, too dark to see
Feel like I am knocking on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door

// Someone Like You //

I got up this morning and fell out of bed
Trying to make it to the door
The wind was high, I didn't have much time
Trying to find a man to score

And then you came up on the other side
To brighten up my day
I knew right away
That this could be my day

Someone like you
Could make me change my ways
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days

There you were, standing
On a crowded street
You looked so good, though the air was bad
Walking through the fog

Someone like you
Could make me change my ways
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days

I want to thank you, thank you now
For getting me back on my feet again
I want to thank you, thank you now
For getting me back on my feet again

Someone like you
Could make me change my ways
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days

Someone like you
Could make me change my ways
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days

// Further On Up The Road //

Further on up the road
Someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Baby, just you wait and see

You gotta reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
You gotta reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
Just like you mistreat someone
Someone's gonna mistreat you

You been laughing, pretty baby
Someday you're gonna be crying
You been laughing, pretty baby
Someday you're gonna be crying
Further on up the road
You'll find out I wasn't lying

Further on up the road
Someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Baby, just you wait and see

// Heaven Is One Step Away //

We searched all through the night
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it
I knew something wasn't right
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it

And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away

And then there came the dawn:
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it
I just had to carry on
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it

And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away

We didn't leave till a quarter to three
All your friends, they were laughing at me
I don't get it, I don't understand
Who is that man holding your hand?

We searched all through the night
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it
I knew something wasn't right
I couldn't find it; you couldn't find it

And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away

Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away

// Too Bad //

It's too bad I don't love you
For you have worried me night and day
It's too bad I don't love you
For you have worried me night and day
Till my heart begins to stammer
And my hair is turning gray

It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good
It's too bad I don't need you
Because we get along so good
You must be thinking, 'bout this time
That my poor heart is made of wood

It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind
It's too bad I don't miss you
'Cause you are always on my mind
I want to stay around your circle
And learn to love you all the time

// Wanna Make Love To You //

How can I explain
This feeling that's true?
Honey, I can't hardly stand it
I wanna make love to you

I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue
Sitting alone here and wondering
I wanna make love to you

When the stars fall from the heavens
And the rivers, they stop their flow
If you just stop and talk to me
Honey, that's when I'll know

I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you

Please, stop and tell me
Tell me you want me too
Come on, baby
I wanna make love to you

I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you

Oh, darling

I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you

I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you

I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
I wanna make love to you
