// It Hurts Me Too //

You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
And the man you love
He hurts you all the time

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

You love him more
When you should love him less
I pick up behind him
And take his mess

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

He love another woman
And I love you
But you love him
And stick to him like glue

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

Now you better leave him
He better put you down
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

// Blues Before Sunrise //

I have the blues before sunrise
Tears standing in my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise
Tears standing in my eyes
It was a miserable feeling, now babe
A feeling I do despise

I have to leave, leave you baby
Because you know you did me wrong
I have to leave you baby
Because you know you did me wrong
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling
And break up my happy home

I have to leave, leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you all alone
I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you all alone
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling
Because you know you done me wrong

Well now goodbye, goodbye baby
I'll see you on some rainy day
Well now goodbye baby
I'll see you on some rainy day
You can go ahead now little darling
'Cause I want you to have your way

// Third Degree //

Got me accused of peeping
I can't see a thing
Got me accused of petting
I can't even raise my hand

Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree

Got me accused of murder
I ain't harmed a man
Got me accused of forgery
I can't even write my name

Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree

Got me accused of taxes
I ain't got a dime
Got me accused of children
Not every one of them was mine

Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree

// Reconsider Baby //

So long
Oh I hate to see you go
So long
Oh I hate to see you go
And the way that I will miss you
I guess you will never know

We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
I'm gonna let you go ahead on now baby
Pray that you'll come back home someday

You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby?
Give yourself just a little more time

// Hoochie Coochie Man //

Gypsy woman told my mother before I was born
You got a boy-child coming, gonna be a son of a gun
Going to make pretty womens jump and shout
Then the world want to know what he's all about

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

I got the black cat bone and I got a mojo too
I got the John the Conqueroo, gonna mess with you
Gonna make you girls lead me by my hand
And then the world will know the hoochie coochie man

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour, on the seventh day
On the seventh month, seven doctors say
"He was born for good luck, that you will see"
I got seven hundred dollars, don't you mess with me!

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

// Five Long Years //

Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve to put me out

I got a job in a steel mill, shucking steel like a slave
Five long years, every Friday I come straight back home with all my pay
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve to put me out

I finally learned my lesson, should a long time ago
The next woman that I marry, she gonna work and bring me the dough
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve
She had the nerve
She had the nerve
She had the nerve to put me out

// I'm Tore Down //

I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found

I went to the river to jump in
My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when."

Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found

I love you babe with all my heart and soul
Love like mine will never grow old
Love you in the morning and in the evening too
Every time you leave me I get mad with you

Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found

I love you baby with all my might
Love like mine is out of sight
I'll lie for you if you want me to
I really don't believe that your love is true

Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found

I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found

// How Long Blues //

How long, baby how long
Has that evening train been gone?

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

I could see the green grass growing on the hill
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

Don't have no money for to ride the train
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?

How long
How how long
Baby how long?

// Goin' Away Baby //

Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Well, you keep me worrying about it all the time

Well, I've needed the love of four women in my life
Well, I've needed the love of four women in my life
Well, my mother and my sister, sweetheart and my wife

If you don't want me baby, please don't dog me around
If you don't want me baby, please don't dog me around
Well, just like you found me, you can put me down

Well now, goodbye, baby, if you crawl back home
Well now, goodbye, baby, if you crawl back home
You can go away, swear you won't stay long

// Blues Leave Me Alone //

The blues, blues trying to drive me away from home
The blues, blues trying to drive me away from home
Had the blues so bad, blues followed me all day long

The blues, blues won't let me take my rest
The blues, blues won't let me take my rest
My mind is rambling like a wild geese out in the west

Well, you're my all day steady, baby, you're my midnight dream
Yes, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream
I love that woman better than anyone I've ever seen

The blues, blues follow me all day long
The blues, blues follow me all day long
Blues, blues, blues won't you please leave me alone?

// Sinner's Prayer //

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please

I used to have plenty of money
The finest clothes in town
But bad luck and trouble overtaken me
Bound to get me down

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please

Keep on working now, child
Lord, every morning

Well, if I've been a bad boy, baby
I declare I'll change my ways
I don't want bad luck and trouble
To follow me all my days

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Well, if I've done somebody wrong, Lord
Have mercy, if you please

// Motherless Child //

If I mistreat you girl, I sure don't mean no harm
If I mistreat you girl, I sure don't mean no harm
Well, I'm a motherless child; I don't know right from wrong

Please tell me pretty mama, honey where'd you stay last night?
Please tell me pretty mama, honey where'd you stay last night?
Well, you didn't come home till the sun was shining bright

I had to go so far girl to get my ham bones boiled
Had to go so far girl to get my ham bones boiled
Well, he's had a lotta women, gonna let my ham bones burn

Well, I did more for you, girl, than your daddy ever done
Well, I did more for you, girl, than your daddy ever done
Well, I give you my jelly, he ain't give you none

And when you see two women, always running hand in hand
When you see two women, always running hand in hand
You can bet your bottom dollar, one got the other one's man

Lord, I'm going to the river, get me a tangled rocking chair
I'm going to the river, get me a tangled rocking chair
And if the blues overtake me, gonna rock away from here

// Someday After A While //

I've got to ride that lonesome train
My heart is heavy with aches and pain
I said but someday, someday, baby
After a while, you will be sorry

Every day, my clouds are gray
It takes you to roll all those clouds away
I said but someday, someday, baby
After a while, you will be sorry

Trouble, trouble, trouble on my mind
Trouble, trouble, way down the line
I don't need, I don't need no sympathy
So babe, babe, don't you, don't you pity me

I may be blue, but I don't mind
Because I know way down the line
I said someday, someday baby
After a while, you will be sorry

// Standin' Round Crying //

Oh baby, look how you got me standin' 'round crying
Oh baby, look how you got me standin' 'round crying
Lord I love you little girl, you're always resting on my mind

Oh baby, I ain't gonna be riding you 'round in my automobile
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be riding you 'round in my automobile
You got so many men, I'm afraid you may get me killed

Oh baby, you ain't nothing like you used to be. (No, don't get me killed, honey!)
Oh baby, you ain't nothing like you used to be. (Oh man, leave that woman alone!)
When I was deep in love with you, little girl, you were just sweet as an apple on a tree

// Drifting Blues //

I'm drifting and drifting
Just like a ship out on the sea
I'm drifting and drifting
Just like a ship out on the sea
Well I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me

If my baby
Would only take me back again
If my baby
Would only take me back again
I would feel much better, darling
And at least I'd have a friend

I give you all my money
Tell me what more can I do
I give you all my money
Tell me what more can I do
You is a sweet little girl
But I swear you won't be true

I'm drifting and drifting
Just like a ship out on the sea
I'm drifting and drifting
Just like a ship out on the sea
Because I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me

// Groaning The Blues //

I'm so tired of moaning
Trying to groan away my blues
I'm so tired of moaning
Trying to groan away my blues
I keep weeping and crying
Every time I think of you

I would rather die of starvation
Perish out in the desert sun
I would rather die of starvation
Perish out in the desert sun
Than to think of some other man
Holding you in his arms

My heart gets so heavy
Lord, I shake down in my bones
My heart gets so heavy
Lord, I shake down in my bones
I can't hurt a murderer
Oh Lord, but I'm forced to weep and moan
