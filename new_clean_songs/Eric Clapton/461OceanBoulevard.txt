// Willie And The Hand Jive //

I know a cat named Way-Out Willie
Got a cool little chick named Rocking Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive, too

Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe
Doing the hand jive with sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, "Do that hand jive one more time."

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive

Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive

Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie junior and that ain't all
Well, the kids got crazy and it's plain to see
Doing the hand jive on TV

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive

// Get Ready //

Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart
Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart

Well, you've been fooling 'round and I don't know why
Left me on my own, sitting high and dry
But I'm going to get you back, just you wait and see
You can't do those things that you're doing to me

Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart
Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart

I've never needed a running 'round pissing hound
Checking out the bitches in heat
You've got a lot of nerve, dishing out what you serve
Waggling your piece of meat

Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart
Ready, get ready. Ready
He's a man who's going to break your heart

I want to get revenge on your sinful sins
I got to get you back for what you did back then
And now you've got it back, life is misery
Well, ha ha ha to you, ha ha to me

Ready, get ready. Ready
He's the one that's going to break your heart
Ready, get ready. Ready
He's the one that's going to break your heart, break your heart
Break your heart, break your heart

Get ready, get ready, get ready
He's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart
Break your heart, break your heart
Break your heart, break your heart
Break your heart

Get ready, get ready, get ready
'Cause he's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart
Break your heart, break your heart

// I Can't Hold Out //

I just talked to my baby on the telephone
She said, "Stop what you're doing and baby come on home."

I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

You said, "Baby don't you worry, you're my heart's desire
You know that I love you, I can't stand to see you cry."

I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

She said, "Baby you can run, you can walk or fly
You know that I love you, you're my heart's desire."

I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone

// Please Be With Me //

Oh my word, what does it mean?
Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly?
Looking out, feeling free

Sit here lying in my bed
Wondering what it was I'd said
That made me think I'd lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

Won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
Because you can find my mind, please be with me

Of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out unsure

Won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
Because you can find my mind, please be with me

// Steady Rollin' Man //

I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
But I ain't got no sweet woman
Woo-hoo Lord, to be rollin' this way

I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
Why can't you hear me begging mama
Woo-hoo Lord, down on my bended knee?

I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
Why can't you hear me begging mama
Woo-hoo Lord, down on my bended knee?

// Mainline Florida //

My heart was leaping in the sun
My friends all say that you're the one
Let me get this one thing very clear:
There ain't enough going on down here

Mainline Florida, oh say
Mainline Florida, OK

Her arms were open, open wide
Her invitation's a changing tide
I could remember not long ago
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row

Mainline Florida, oh say
Mainline Florida, OK

Her arms were open, open wide
Her invitation's a changing tide
I could remember not long ago
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row

Mainline Florida, oh say
Mainline Florida, OK

// Give Me Strength //

Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on
Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on
My home may be out on the highway
Lord, I've done so much wrong
But please, give me strength to carry on

Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on
Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on
My home may be out on the highway
Lord, I've done so much wrong
But please, give me strength to carry on
