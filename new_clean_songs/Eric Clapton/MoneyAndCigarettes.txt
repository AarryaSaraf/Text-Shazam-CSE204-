// Everybody Oughta Make A Change //

Change in the weather
Change in the sea
Come back baby
You'll find a change in me

Everybody, they ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later
We have to go down in that lonesome ground

I changed suits
I changed shirts
I changed, baby
Just to get shed of the dirt

Everybody, we ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later
We're going down in that lonesome ground

I changed honey
I changed money
I changed, people
Just to keep from being funny

Everybody, they ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later
We're going down in that lonesome ground

Change in the ocean
Change in the sea
Come back baby
You'll find a change in me

Everybody, we ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later
We're going down in that lonesome ground

// Ain't Going Down //

It ain't no big deal, we're all lucky to be alive
I myself don't believe in luck, or taking chances, I will survive
Every move I make, every twist and every turn
You scandalize and humble me, I may be slow but I will learn

'Cause I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore

If I had my way, I would probably just sit and stare
Watch the T.V. or read a book, I'd have no reason to be aware
But I ain't got time, I just could not live that way
I've got to step outside myself, I've still got something left to say

'Cause I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore

'Cause I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore
No I ain't going down anymore

Channelled in my groove, part of another space and time
Please allow me to introduce another very good friend of mine
Some call him fear, some call him righteousness
I myself ain't clear, and you can't force me to make a guess

// I've Got A Rock 'N' Roll Heart //

I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy, before we explode
There's something 'bout me, baby, you got to know
You got to know

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin' me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change
I don't want to change

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

I've got a, you've got a rock 'n' roll heart

// Man Overboard //

You say you do when you don't – you say you will when you won't
You make me laugh make me cry – you make me live make me die
You put me in put me out – you make me scream make me shout
You pick me up put me down – you make me king make me clown

I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard
I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard

You can turn on the light in the middle of the night
You can put me to rest, what you do is the best
You can turn me away and get me back the next day
You can fill up my heart or you can tear it apart

I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard
I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard

You got me so excited you put my heart on overload
You got my soul ignited – I'm getting ready to explode
There ain't no early warning for what I'm going through
I got the fever in the morning because my heart is set on you

I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard
I'm like a man on fire, a man overboard

// Pretty Girl //

Pretty girl, you are the light of my life
I mean my everything
You're the one I chose to make my wife
That's why you wear my ring

And when I'm feeling down and out
You're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home
Pretty girl, my pretty girl, pretty girl, my pretty girl

Pretty girl, don't ever say goodbye
Don't ever let me be
If you do, you know that I will die
You mean that much to me

And when I'm feeling down and out
You're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home
Pretty girl, my pretty girl, pretty girl, my pretty girl

And when I'm feeling down and out
You're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home
Pretty girl, my pretty girl, pretty girl, my pretty girl

Pretty girl, hear what I have to say
It's something you should know
You brought me sunshine on my darkest day
That's why I love you so

And when I'm feeling down and out
You're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home
Pretty girl, my pretty girl, pretty girl, my pretty girl

// Man In Love //

You're always in my hair, you keep me feeling fine
I celebrate every time I realize you're really mine

'Cause I'm a man in love
Yes I'm a man in love
I tell it everywhere I go
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love

I used to be so sad, like a dog without a bone
And then you gave me something baby I had never known

'Cause I'm a man in love
Yes I'm a man in love
I tell it everywhere I go
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love

I love to see you walk up and down the street
You look so pretty baby from your head down to your feet

'Cause I'm a man in love
Yes I'm a man in love
I tell it everywhere I go
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love

Well, the minutes seem like hours, and the hours seem like days
And the days they seem like years every time you go away

'Cause I'm a man in love
Yes I'm a man in love
I tell it everywhere I go
I want the whole world to know
That I'm a man in love

// Crosscut Saw //

I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"

Some call me Woodcutting Sam
Some call me Woodcutting Jim
The last girl I cut wood for
She wants me back again

I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"

I got a double-bladed axe
That really cuts good
Well, I'm a crosscut saw
Gonna bury me in your wood

I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I'm a crosscut saw
Baby, drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"

// Slow Down Linda //

Well, if you're looking for a winner, then you know you've got to go with me
I've got more ashes than Wednesday and you know I can brew my tea
I'm fixing to teach you everything I know
I'll take you with me baby everywhere I go
If I can catch you for a minute I know you'll take a chance with me

So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

I've seen you speeding down the highway when you ought to dig the scenery
And you can wolf down your dinner in the time it takes to drink my tea
You're always rushing 'round everywhere you go
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road
I can't keep running much longer you always go too fast for me

So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

I think that you're getting too old to be running around
I think that it's time you thought about settling down
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company

You're always rushing 'round everywhere you go
You leave me eating dirt on the side of the road
I can't keep running much longer, you always go too fast for me

So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you think that you could save a little time with me?
So slow down, slow down Linda
Don't you know that I've been waiting for your company?

// Crazy Country Hop //

Way down in a country town one day
A little, old country band began to play
They had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone
When the leader said go them cats began to blow

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll

Now all the people gathered around
Just to dig that rocking-rolling sound
Suddenly the drummer rang a bell
And all them country cats began to yell

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll

Old McDonald did a crazy bop
Said it's time to milk my cow, I got to stop
But just before I cool it and cut out
Here's something all you cats can think about

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll

Snaggle-toothed Malinda was a drag
She latched onto a dude who showed up stag
He tried to run and then he tripped and fell
She kissed him and we all could hear him yell

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll

Well, a hound dog ran a polecat into town
Brought him to the dance and laid him down
Someone hollered skunk and you can bet
All them country cats is running yet

Ooh wee oh oh
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll
