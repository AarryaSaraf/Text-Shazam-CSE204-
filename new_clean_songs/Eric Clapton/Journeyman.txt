Album: Journeyman

// Pretending //

How many times must we tell the tale?
How many times must we fall?
Living in lost memory
You just recalled

Working on the sound of the band
Trying to get the music right
Two go out working
Three stay home at night

That's when she said she was pretending
Like she knew the plan
That's when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand

Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending

Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You're never who you used to think you are
How strange

I get lost in alibis
Sadness can't prevail
Everybody knows strong love
Can't fail

Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real
Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real

Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending

// Anything For Your Love //

God's got a plan, he's making it clear
Sweet little love song in your ear
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail

I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love

Listen now baby, I'll tell you true
Just how much that I love you
I got a sweet feelin' I know is real
This kind of love you can't conceal

I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love

I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love

// Bad Love //

Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong

I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had till I met you
But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me
With you here by my side
And there's no more memories to remind me
Your love will keep me alive

I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

// Hard Times //

My mother told me before she passed away
Said, Son, when I'm gone, don't forget to pray
Because there'll be hard times, Lord, those hard times
Who knows better than I?

Well, I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay the rent
Talkin' about hard times, oh those hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman who was always around
But when I lost my money, she put me down
Talkin' about hard times, Lord, those hard
Yea yea, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard time, no more hard
Yea yea, who knows better than I?

// Hound Dog //

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

You told me you was high class
I could see through that
You told me you was high class
I could see through that
And baby I know
You ain't no real cool cat

You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
'Cause I'm looking for a woman
All you're lookin' for is a home

// No Alibis //

I beg your pardon, hello darling
This is me you are talking to
Sit down and tell me about it
You don't have to shout it at me
Tell me what you really want to do

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Mountain gets steeper
The hole you dig gets deeper
You better stop and climb out
I'm trying to give it all to you
But baby, I can see right through you
Sometimes you lose what it's all about

Don't give me no alibis
Can't go through life trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Mountain gets steeper
The hole you dig is getting deeper
You better reach and pull yourself out
Nobody ever going to love you the way that I love you
I never want to see you doing without

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

// Run So Far //

You fly
Out as your smile wears thin
And I sigh
Knowing the mess you're in
And you know that you can't get away
And you know you can't hide it from yourself

Lonely days, heavy heart
No escape, can only run so far

I know
Something I ought to say
Stuck here
Trying to find a way
And you know that you can't get away
And you know you can't hide it from yourself

Lonely nights, blue guitar
No way out, can only run so far

Lonesome tears, at the bar
One way street, can only run so far

I pray
That you might make it through
Those teardrops
Now seems a part of you
And you know that you can't get away
And you know you can't hide it from yourself

Fallin' down, under par
Can't get out, can only run so far

Lonely days, heavy heart
No escape, can only run so far

Lonesome tears, at the bar
One way street, can only run so far

// Breaking Point //

Well I just don't get it
Can't make the pieces fit
I might just as well forget it
But my heart won't let me quit

You say it's only a part of love
That's right
But I get a little worried sometimes
When I start to lose
Tired of holding it together
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse

I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point

Well you're never gonna get it
If you don't get up and try
Try and spread those wings around me
Honey, let me see you fly

You say it's only a part of love
That's right
But I get a little worried sometimes
When I start to lose
Tired of holding it together
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse

I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point

Maybe someday you'll recover
I can see it in your eyes
One more thing that you'll discover
That you'll finally realize

I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point

I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point

I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point
I'm at my breaking point
At my breaking point

// Lead Me On //

(Wouldn't lie to you, baby)
(Wouldn't lie to you, baby)

Tell me anything you think I wanna hear
Just to keep me standin' here
To secure your shaky fears

Tell me you love me, but in your heart you know you don't
So you lie 'cause you think I want
To make believe you love when you don't

Lead me on, lead me on
Lead me on, lead me on
I'll play along and along and along
Baby lead me on
Lead me on

Pretend it's rainin' when the tears flow from my eyes
And you're warm when you're cold as ice
And everything's gonna be alright

And it's a shame, little Johnny wears my name
And you know I'm not the one
Still you say he is my son

Lead me on, lead me on
Lead me on, lead me on
I'll play along and along and along
Baby lead me on
Lead me on

And when I leave to go work for you
You cry you're lonely too
To make me feel your love is true

But in your dreams you slip and tell it all
I hear you calling out his name
You say you love him loud and plain

Lead me on, lead me on
Lead me on, lead me on
I'll play along and along and along
Baby lead me on
Lead me on
