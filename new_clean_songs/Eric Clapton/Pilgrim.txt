// My Father's Eyes //

Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again

Just a toerag on the run
How did I get here?
What have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watch this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow

Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay

As my soul slides down to die
How could I lose him?
What did I try?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That he was here with me
I look into my father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

// River Of Tears //

It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today
It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I'm going to hide my face
And about half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace

Lord, how long have I got to keep on running?
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is, since you've been gone
Feel like I'm drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river

In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face
I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again

Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning
Drowning in a river
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river
Lord, how long must it go on?

Drowning
Drowning
Drowning in a river of tears

// Pilgrim //

And how do I choose and where do I draw the line
Between truth and necessary pain?
And how do I know and where do I get my belief
That things will be all right again?

What words do I use to try and explain
To those who've witnessed all my tears?
And what does it mean to know all these things
When love's been wasted all these years
When love's been wasted all these years

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love

It's like living in a nightmare
Like looking in the blackest hole
Like standing on the edge of nothing
Completely out of control

Now where have I been all these years
And how come I just couldn't see?
Like a blind man walking around in darkness
I was a pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from all the people
Who could never understand

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love

I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love

// Broken Hearted //

When the wind blows down this hard
Many a bond is broken
See the water lie on the ground
From where the heavens opened

Lord, how will you get through this night
With your dreams departed?
And who, alone, will comfort you?
Only the broken-hearted

So you've gone beyond your means
Every wound is open
Your best laid plans are out of reach
And all your fears unspoken

Lord, how will you get through this night
With your dreams departed?
And who, alone, will comfort you?
Only the broken-hearted

Sweet revenge is spoken then
In the twilight, it is gone
To living lies with no escape
Lord, I would rather be alone

I press my fingers to the wood
To tell you of my dreaming
To sing you songs from olden times
To keep the love light gleaming

Because there's a place where we can go
Where we will not be parted
And who alone will enter there?
Only the broken-hearted

Only the broken, broken-hearted
Only the broken, broken-hearted
Only the broken, broken-hearted
Only the broken, broken-hearted

// One Chance //

Without wishing to cause you any pain
I got to push on through, babe
And if I take the chance of seeing you again
I just don't know what I would do, baby

And sometimes I think I'm gonna be just fine
All I got to do is go through it, babe
Then I hear those voices in the back of my mind
Telling me over and over and over that I blew it babe

You had one chance and you blew it
You may never get another chance
You had the floor and you knew it
You can't blame it on your circumstance

At the risk of causing you a little pain
I'm going to have to forget you, babe
'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain
And you'd do the same again if I let you, babe

I would give anything to hold you in my arms
But you know I can't do that, baby
I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made
Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it

You had one chance and you blew it
You may never get another chance
You had the floor and you knew it
You can't blame it on your circumstance

You had one chance and you blew it
You may never get another chance
You had the floor and you knew it
You can't blame it on your circumstance

You had one chance and you blew it
You may never get another chance
You had the floor and you knew it
You can't blame it on your circumstance

You had one chance and you blew it
You may never get another chance
You had the floor and you knew it
You can't blame it on your circumstance

// Circus //

Little man with his eyes on fire
And his smile so bright
In his hands are the toys you gave
To fill his heart with delight

And in the ring stands a circus clown
Holding up a knife
What you see and what you will hear
Will last you for the rest of your life

And it's sad, so sad
There ain't no easy way round
And it's sad, so sad
All you friends gather round
'Cause the circus left town

Little man with his heart so pure
And his love so fine
Stick with me and I'll ride with you
'Til the end of the line

Hold my hand and I'll walk with you
Through the darkest night
And when I smile I'll be thinking of you
And every little thing will be all right

And it's sad, so sad
There ain't no easy way round
And it's sad, so sad
All you friends gather round
'Cause the circus left town

And it's sad, so sad
There ain't no easy way round
And it's sad, so sad
All you friends gather round
'Cause the circus left town

The circus left town, left town
The circus left town, left town

// Going Down Slow //

I have had my fun if I never get well no more
I have had my fun if I never get well no more
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

Please write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
Please write my mother and tell her the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin

On the next train south, look for my clothes back home
On the next train south, look for my clothes back home
As all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow

// Fall Like Rain //

Tell me why did I fall in love with you?
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?
Tore me all to pieces, cut me half in two
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?

Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?
Tore me all to pieces, nothing else remains
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?

Worry, worry, worry
Worry all day long
Don't know where I'm going
Don't know right from wrong

Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why

Tell me why did I fall in love with you?
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?
Tore me all to pieces, cut me half in two
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?

Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?
Tore me all to pieces, nothing else remains
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?

Fall like rain, fall like rain
Fall like rain, fall like rain
Fall like rain, fall like rain
Fall like rain, fall like rain

// Born In Time //

In the lonely night
In the stardust of a pale moonlight
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams

I walked alone through the shaky streets
Listening to my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
When we were born in time

Just when I thought you were gone, you came back
Just when I was ready to receive you
You were smooth, you were rough
You were more than enough
Ah babe, why did I ever leave you?
Or believe you?

In the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
I took you close and got what I deserve
When we were born in time

Just when I knew who to thank, you went blank
Just as the firelight was gleaming
You were snow, you were rain
You were stripes and you were plain
Oh babe, can it be you've been scheming?
Or was I dreaming?

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You're still so deep inside of me
When we were born in time

In time
In time
In time

// Sick And Tired //

I'm gonna buy me a parrot, baby
And teach him how to call my name
I'm gonna buy me a parrot, baby
And teach him how to call my name
Then I won't have to miss you, baby
And I won't have you driving me insane

I was in love with you, baby
'Til the day you brought me down so low
I was in love with you, baby
'Til the day you brought me down so low
You had me walking around in circles, baby
I didn't know which way to go

Oh, I'm so sick and tired, baby
I'm sick and tired of the way you carry on
Lord, I'm sick and tired, baby
Sick and tired of the way you carry on
You can pack up all of your things, baby
Hit the road, get out of here, be gone

Now I'm gonna get me a shotgun, baby
Keep it stashed behind the door
I'm gonna get me a shotgun, baby
Keep it stashed behind the bedroom door
I may have to blow your brains out, baby
Then you won't bother me no more, no more

// Needs His Woman //

You left him standing in the pouring rain
There's every chance he'll go insane
And someone comes along and takes his hand
He must have love, can't you understand that

He needs his woman
He needs his woman
And he needs his woman
He needs his woman to love

His hands are shaking and his head hangs down
No peace of mind for him is found
Break his heart and then you'll set him free
Someone must save him, just you wait and see, but

He needs his woman
He needs his woman
And he needs his woman
He needs his woman to love

What will it take 'til you believe his love is real?
Nobody said he had to love you, now he always will

He'll walk that lonely road again today
The love he gave you, you threw away
When all he wanted was a hand to hold
His lonely world has grown so cold and

He needs his woman
He needs his woman
And he needs his woman
He needs his woman to love

He needs his woman
He needs his woman
And he needs his woman
He needs his woman to love

// She's Gone //

In the middle of the night, in the middle of the day
She can make me feel all right and make it all okay
She can make me feel so good by looking in my eye
She can take me to the edge, take me to the sky

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
I'm telling you she's gone

She put her hands in my hair, put her kiss on my face
She puts my heart in my mouth, my soul in its place
Who could love me like she does? Who could even start to try?
She can love me more than you, I never wonder why

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
I'm telling you she's gone

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
I'm telling you she's gone

Like a shadow in the dark, like a ripple on a stream
I see her float across my mind like a picture in a dream
And the more that I know, seems the more that I care
Give the world and all I own just to know that she's still there
Like a shadow in the dark, like a ripple in a stream
But you're floating on my mind

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
I'm telling you she's gone

She's gone, she's gone, she's gone
I'm telling you she's gone

// You Were There //

We made the distance
Yeah, we made the day
You made all the difference
'Cause you found the way

Without your wisdom
Lord, where would we be
Lost in the wilderness
Somewhere out at sea

But you were there
Through the days of wine and madness
When I'd always put you down
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down

You found the meaning
And helped me to see
Where I was going to
All that I could be

Without permission
You turned the key
You climbed the prison wall
Deep inside of me

You were there
Through the days of wine and madness
When I'd turn and put, put you down
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down

You were there
Through the days of wine and madness
When I'd turn and put, put you down
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down
Let me down

You were there
You were there
You were there

// Inside Of Me //

The point on the water, there's a change in the air
A vibe in the darkness, but there's nobody there
I look for the reason, but there's nothing to see
Just a hole in my memory where my mind used to be

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?

But why should I worry and why do I care
When this road that I walk on is going nowhere?
I stand and I study every face in the crowd
See the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?

Scratching the surface, it all looks the same
A world full of anger with no one to blame
But who can I turn to? Who holds the key?
And who has the answer? I think it's inside of me

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?
