Album: Nostradamus

// Prophecy //

I am the darkness
Born out of light
I am the force the fire
That burns here tonight

Bringing the future
To all mankind
Guider of life - of death
The dight of the blind

Your future lies within my eyes
What I predict will terrify
I can't control what comes to be
From the past to the present to eternity

I am Nostradamus
Do you you believe
I am Nostradamus
That I conceive

Master of chaos
Anger and rage
I hold the key
My presence will unlock the cage
I am your witness
The one who can tell
Bearing the sword - the shield
To your heaven from hell

As I unfold the mystery
I change the course of history
With premonitions from the void
Will you live, will you die
Will your worlds collide

I am Nostradamus
The hand of fate
I am Nostradamus
With love and hate

Lost in this vortex
The mystery begins
Will you be victim
Saved from your sins
Time is illusion
Trapped in the skies
Destiny's calling
Hear from my eyes

Many years ago a boy was born
A boy with a gift
A gift that would be the envy of all mankind
To see what no other could - great visions
of the future
Or would a curse be bestowed on the boy
The boy whose name was Nostradamus,
damus, damus. Damus, damus, damus

I am Nostradamus
Do not forsake
I am Nostradamus
Your life's at stake

I am Nostradamus
The lightning rod
I am Nostradamus
The voice of God

Celestial comets
Reign towards earth
Alchemy's tempest
Predicting your worth
Pray for deliverance
Escape if you can
For I have borne witness
To the purging of man

// Awakening //

As the evening comes to pass
I prepare myself to ask
Never knowing what may come
Close the door and turn the key
Reeling in uncertainty
As my heart begins to race

// Revelations //

I see all things
From my mind's innocence
When they call me
I hear their prophecy

You say I must
Face my own deliverance
Did you choose me
Have I lost sanity

These eyes can see right through me
I feel your soul inside
What have you waiting for me
I'll do what you decide

And now this possession
Becomes my obsession
Adrift in illusion
I'm sent into confusion

Such torment and sadness
That overwhelms like madness
So fearful and intense
It burns inside

I'll spread the word
Around the world
My name will last
Eternally

I have the power
I have the choice
They'll hear my voice
For centuries

Pandora's Box is opened
Too late no turning round
A paradox has woken
I serve with honor bound

I take this possession
And make it my obsession
Alive in illusion
To make sense from confusion

Come torment come sadness
Give me the joy of madness
This fear and this intent
Runs deep inside

This deepest possession
For my life
I want this obsession
In my life
I claim this possession
Take my life

// The Four Horsemen //

Horsemen raised from the light
Omens filled with dread
Descreation I beheld
A world of men gone mad
The final age comes to pass
Apocalypse is here at last
A call to arms - the end to all
Peace on earth no more

// War //

We come in all the glory now
No prayers suffice such evil foe
Black wings the storm is gathering
And time will say
We know the power of heresy
Is on it's way

Gods of war
Heed their warning
Gods of war
They are coming now

No man can quell the suffering
The hell and all the grief it brings
Our life is almost over no there's
nothing more
We feel the pain is everywhere
It comes and roars

Gods of war
Judge and jury
Gods of war
Pain and fury now

We must hold this threat
From such panic yet
There will come a time
When we'll be saved
Our resilient heart
To confound defeat yeah!

Out of purgatory
Unto victory
We shall overcome
The war they staged
Through unyielding power
In the darkest hour
They will retreat

Gods of war
Devastation
Gods of war
End creation now!

// Sands Of Time //

The winds of change are everywhere
And all the world must be aware
There's nowhere left for man to go
The sands of time are running low

These vision fall before my face
I see the end of human's race
These feelings rise inside my soul
And everything is out of control

The winds of change
Are in the air
The winds of change
Are everywhere

// Pestilence And Plague //

The storms from the gods make us
Perish with hunger
Starvation and drought
Are unleashed on this earth
Reap what you sow
From your greed and our treasures
Far more than we need
Now far more than we're worth

[Chorus:]
Nella tentazione
Cercando la gloria
Il prezzo da pagare
E' la caduta dell'uomo

[English translation:]
In temptation
Seeking for glory
The price to pay
Is the fall of mankind

How can we live in despair and in sorrow?
Our children are lost
With all that we love
Plague spreading forth
To lay waste to our culture
Civilization's demise from above

[Chorus]

This world revolves and I foretell
The end of man resides in hell
For you can see that in my heart
We will depart

[Chorus]

Nella tentazione (Into temptation)
Cercando la gloria (In search of glory)
Il prezzoda pagare (The price we pay)
E'la caduta dell'uomo (The fall of man)

// Death //

I will take your final breath
And I will be your last regret
Cold blood - runs in my blackened heart
Tearing - every soul apart

Messenger of death - wields the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - hold his blade
For termination

Sin - is what I feast upon
I'm forging my crematorium
Your tomb - is waiting here for you
Welcome to my ritual

Messenger of death - wirlds the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - holds his blade
For termination

Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky

Death rides out from the storm
No time left to repent
No quarter - no escape
No line of self defence

Death rides out from the storm
In terror we confess
Our voice is heard no more
His deed is merciless

Death rides out from the storm
Deface humanity
There's no escape from this
Human calamity

Death rides out from the storm
We turn to God and cry
Ignored we turn to face
This vengeance from the sky
Messenger of death - wields the scythe
Of man's damnation
Messenger of death - holds his blade
For termination

// Peace //

Memories unfold
Search the past to
Never growing old
Once we had peace
Such peace

Seasons come and go
Every man's a child to someone
Learning as we grow
Love and you'll live
Forgive

Conquest transgress
Purgatory
Lift us onward
Trust in glory

// Conquest //

The night of reckoning
The days of old
His might is menacing
Sword and shield made of gold

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Bow down in reverence
Keep faith be true
Give thans for armistice
Be brave he'll come through

Sword and shield of gold
The mighty stand alone

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger

Revenge and reckoning
Beware of this god
His might is menacing
Shield made of gold

Conquest and fire
The age of desire
When man will be free once more
Like rays from the sun
That heal everyone
Living for evermore

Conquest and fire
We will be strong
Days of desire
Making us stronger

Conquest attest
Stands triumphant
Heaven sent - be vigilant
Don't relinquish

// Lost Love //

I carry with me all the love that you give
You bought me serenity - a reason to live
Our life is a journey
That we took from the start
We made all these memories together

I can remember
The first time that we met
The feelings you gave to me - I'll never forget
I knew from that moment
When our love first began

We'd last till the end of time forever

And though there were bad times
We stood by each other
And did what we had to get through

You live in my heart - when you're far away
I see you in dreams - where I hear you say
I'm with your forever in true love
By light of the day - and stars above

And when there were bad times
We held on each other
To face what we had to get through

You live in my heart - when you're far away
I see you in dreams - where I hear you say
Look up to heaven - and I'll be there
Still guiding my heart
Still saying our prayer

// Persecution //

We're watching you
Nowhere to hide
Obey the holy law
Repent for your sins
There is but one God

Against their holy laws
I'll do whatever it takes
I've met their kind before
We're martyrs burned at their stake

They try to dominate
I'll be the thorn in their side
They underestimate
The willpower feeding my pride

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution

Their words just crucify
Condemning truth that I seek
They cannot justify
The pain, the havoc they wreak

I never will conform
My faith is deep to the core
I stand against reform
I'll never kneel down before

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution

With raised fists of fire
As they conspire
I'll be defiant
Against the alliance

They will not eradicate me
Break my will or suffocate me
I will subjugate the hate
That they breed

As the church interrogates
I cannot see they supplicate me
Execute and ridicule
We're all freed

I never will conform
My faith is deep to the core
I stand against reform
I'll never kneel down before

The hand of persecution
Defy the instituation

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution

Persecute
You defy

Execute crucify
Crucify

Persecute
You defy

Restitute crucify
Crucify

Persecute
You defy

Execute crucify
Crucify

Persecute
You defy

Crucify
You survive

// Exiled //

I must leave from fear they send
Journey with the dawn
As I take the winding road
Bow my head forlorn
Now I must go

I'm banished in exile
I wander this land
No faith in the future
I'm in their command

Cross over the mountains
and valleys so wide
I walk as I wonder
With hope by my side

All my friends are far away
How I miss my home
Where do I find peace of mind
Guide me as I roam
I cry for you

I'm banished in exile
To meet their demand
Rejected messiah
They don't understand

I'm searching for something
That's lost in my heart
God knows I'm a sinner
I'm falling apart

If this is my destiny
I've got to believe
The passion inside me
Has left me to bleed

I'm banished in exile
I wander this land
No faith in the future
I'm in their command

Cross over the mountains
And valleys so wide
I walk as I wonder
With hope by my side

If this is my destiny
I've got to believe
This passion inside of me
Has left me to bleed

// Alone //

They say we are fools
We say look at you
Long ago we were just a few
Still say we don't need you

[Chorus:]
We don't wanna belong, we said all along, we just wanna be left alone
We don't wanna belong, we said all along, we just wanna be left alone

Think that we must have lost our way
Running from the blaze, you were wrong
Chose our course, counted off the days
Enduring inner rage, we got strong

[Chorus]

You deny everything that's good
Acting as you would with your shame
So we turned and left you all behind
We don't need your kind, you're to blame

[Chorus]

In the years to come you'll hear my name
When darkness falls on Judgment Day

They say we are fools
We say look at you
Long ago we were just a few
Still we say we don't need you
Think that we must have lost our way
Running from the blaze, you were wrong
We chose our course, counted off the days
Enduring inner rage, we got strong

[Chorus x2]

// Shadows In The Flame //

As the day begins to fade
Eventide's when I'm afraid
I'll never know if you appear
But my senses say you're near

In the dark when I write
Telling fortunes for my life
I'm sitting here by candle flame
When will you arrive again

// Visions //

Anvils ignite
Once again
I watch them dance around the plain

Sparks start to fly
I can't speak
From seeing answers that I seek

Shapes start to form
As I stare
The shadows taunt as if to dare

Ghostly embrace takes my heart
Now I surrender and it starts

[Chorus:]
Visions in the night
Show me what is right
Help me through the maze
...of mystery
I would sell my soul
If only I could know
What the future holds
And what will be

Slowly my hand (my hand)
Turns the page (the page)
It never ceases to amaze

Fill me with hope (with hope)
If you can (fill me with hope)
I will become a better man

[Chorus]

Visions come
Into my mind
Foretell the future
Of mankind

Only time will prove that I'm right
Will my words come true (will my words come true)
I can't deny the gift of foresight (I can't deny)
There's nothing I can do

[Chorus 2x]

// Hope //

Hope in my heart
As a new day has dawned
I see your light on the wings of a dove
Lifting me up as the dark clouds retreat
Courage transcends and you make me complete
Hope in my heart with the advent of spring
I am reborn with the love that you bring

(Help me before we dread it)

// New Beginnings //

Now at last my dream is real
I found peace
True love can heal
On the journey throughout time
A new beginning has arrived
At the crossroads of my life
This new love keeps me alive

I never knew that this could happen to me
So many lonely days and nights
I never knew that you were waiting for me
Hope was out of dight
And suddenly I see the future clearly
No longer living in the past
As I let go

Living the dream
Of my life
I was alone no-one in sight
This love - make me believe that you're the one
Never give up - our day has come

I never felt that this could happen to me
So many lonely days and lonely nights
I never knew that you were waiting for me
Hope was out of sight
And suddenly I see the future clearly
Finally I know at last
I can let go

// Calm Before The Storm //

I always tried to keep the faith
And held my head up high

I stood against those tides of fear
And held onto my pride

Never lost the will to live
And this can't be denied
In the calm before the storm
In the calm before the storm

// Nostradamus //

They never broke my will
Cause my heart was strong
They won't justify
Condemnation, my vindication
But I will survive

Stood my ground 'till the end
Engaged the enemy protect my friends

Nostradamus [x2]

Tamed the beast
They sent to kill
The congregation never broke my will

Nostradamus [x2]

He has overcome
He can take the throne

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

I walked through fire to justify
Their inquisitions all condemned to die

Nostradamus [x2]

Adversity on which I thrived
Destroys the altar now I'm vilified

Nostradamus [x2]

He has seized the day
He is here to stay

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Vindication,
He has been avenged

They never broke my will
Because my heart was strong
They can't justify
I will survive

He has overpowered
It's his finest hour

Nostradamus; vindication
Nostradamus; is avenged

Nostradamus; our salvation
Nostradamus; he's avenged

Nostradamus [x4]

// Future Of Mankind //

This one reveals my fate
And so my friends farewell
I can no longer wait
My prophecies remain
They live when I am gone

The wisdom of the wise
Eternally endure
My legacy survives
So you can rest assured
The secret treasures here
Make the what you will

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life evolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

I'll cross the rubicon
Into infinity
My quest has now been won
I've found my destiny
The darkness brings me home
Rewarding me with peace

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life evolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

Now everything shall pass
We all know that it must
For nothing ever last
We all return to dust
I beg you not to mourn
As I will never die

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life dissolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

Je suis au bout de ma viw
Ma tâche est finie
Je passe de ce monde á un autre
Mes prémonitions survivront
Prenez garde á mes paroles
Par ce qu'elles adviendront
Le patrimoine que j'ai laissé
L'avenir de 'lhumanité
