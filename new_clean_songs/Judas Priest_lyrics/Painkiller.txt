Album: Painkiller

// Painkiller //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine

Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas

Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave

With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!

Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

// Hell Patrol //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road

Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol

Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground

Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The Hell Patrol

Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you

Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you

Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs
The Hell Patrol

// All Guns Blazing //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean

Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream

All Guns, All Guns Blazing

Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike

Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike

All Guns, All Guns Blazing

Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage

Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

All Guns, All Guns Blazing

// Leather Rebel //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red

Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge

Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel
With a burning heart

Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power

Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours

I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

// Metal Meltdown //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight

Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya

Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives

Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground

High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya

Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives

Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light

Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud

It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

// Night Crawler //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs

Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

// Between The Hammer & The Anvil //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare

The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high

The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil

Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul

Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate

The burning sermons will survive their curse
Between the Hammer and the Anvil

Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief

This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright

The burning sermons consecrate their sin
Between the Hammer and the Anvil

Storm warning
But there's no fear

// A Touch Of Evil //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford, K. K. Downing, Chris Tsangarides]

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right

Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear

I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil

Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance

A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in

I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil

Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire

A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in

You're possessing me

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil

A Touch of Evil

A Touch of Evil

Touch

// One Shot At Glory //

[Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford & K.K. Downing]

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins

Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see

This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember

One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said

One Shot At Glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
One Shot At Glory

Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel

I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won

// Living Bad Dreams //

I'm hypnotised
and helpless
Beneath the pale
full moon
My body is your sacrifice
You spirit's coming soon

I stare up at a
squalid night

It's been so cold
and smooth
Turns tender kisses
into bites
As you begin to move

You look so weak
and fragile
You seem to drip
and sway
But you swept me up into
your arms
And carried me away

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

You led me to temptation
Delivered me to pain
I walked upon you
hallowed ground
My soul is yours to gain

Your passion drains
my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in
slow motion
Into eternal sleep

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

[Lead Break]

Your passion drains
my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in
slow motion
Into eternal sleep
I'm living bad dreams

I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

I'm living bad dreams
Oh oh
I don't want bad dreams
Living bad dreams

// Leather Rebel (Live) //

This is the story of the Leather Rebel...

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red

Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge

Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

Leather Rebel... Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel... With a burning heart

Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power

Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours

I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Leather Rebel... Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel... With a burning heart

Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

Leather Rebel... Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel... With a burning heart

Leather Rebel... Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel... With a burning heart

Leather Rebel

Leather Rebel
