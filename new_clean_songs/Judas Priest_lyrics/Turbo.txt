Album: Turbo

// Turbo Lover //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

You won't hear me, but you'll feel me
Without warning, something's dawning, listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
You can't retreat, I spy like no other

Then we race together, we can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear, I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

// Locked In //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

I can't stand the way you move it
You drive me crazy with that walk
You get me so excited
I tremble and I shake
When you make the moves you make

You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore

You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

I can't take it when you touch me
Feels so good I could explode
You've got me in a frenzy
I tremble and I quake
When you shake the things you shake

You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore

You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
Locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

You've got the key
The key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours, for evermore

You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

You've got me locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

// Private Property //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

You think you're cool and got it all
You think you run the scene
I don't believe how you'd concieve
That your good enough for me
You think you've got it all sewn up
But I'll cut you right down to size
The way I figure you dont exist
So you'd better realize

Don't you touch
Don't get near
Don't take me for a fool
Make no mistake
No give and take
I'm too good for you

So keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off me
Hands off
Keep your hands off me

I'm number one when I turn it on
Do you think you can relate
You'd be amazed, left in a daze
To see me operate

Don't you touch
Don't get near
Don't take me for a fool
Make no mistake
No give and take
I'm too good for you

So keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh

You live in a fantasy
I don't even care.
If you're lookin' for sympathy
It ain't there

Hands off
Keep your dirty hands off me.

So keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Keep your hands off
Private property
Hands off
Oh Oh
Hands off

// Parental Guidance //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

You say I waste my life away
But I live it to the full
How would you know anyway
You're just mister dull
Why don't you get into the things we do today
You could lose twenty years right away
So we say

We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here

Every day you scream at me
To turn the music low
Well if you keep on screaming
You'll make me deaf you know.
You always chew me out, because I stay out late
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date
Get one thing straight

We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here

There's no communication
I'm tired of explanation
Is this message getting through
You went through the same thing too

Don't you remember what it's like to lose control
Put on my jacket for you get too old
Let's rock and roll

We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no
No no no
Parental guidance here

Oh no
One life
And I'm gonna live it up

// Rock You All Around The World //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

In the cities of the world
You know every boy and girl
Goes crazy to the beat of rock n' roll
And as the volume is soaring
All the crowd is roaring
Let it roll

Well, we don't care in the least
Cause our metal is a feast
But there's always someone trying to put it down
So we crank the music louder
And our voices turn to power
With a wall of sound we'll blow 'em all away

Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock
We're gonna roll
We're gonna shake you down
We're gonna lose control

No one can hold us down
Just look around and see
This generation's getting up and breakin' free

No one can hold us down
Just look around and see
This generation's getting up and breakin' free

Rock you all around the world
Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock
We're gonna rock you
Rock you all around the world

Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock
We're gonna rock you
Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock rock rock you
Rock you all around the World
We're gonna rock
We're gonna rock you.
Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock rock rock you
Rock you all around the world
We're gonna rock
We're gonna rock you.
Rock you all around the world

// Out In The Cold //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

I'm layin' awake at night
I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heart beat
And a voice in the dark of some kind

Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Out in the cold
Hear me calling
Cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

I know it was you I hurt
I didn't mean to hurt you
So much to forgive and forget
Can't take anymore of this hurt
On no, Oh no
There's so many things I regret

Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now
Hear me calling
I need you I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heart beat
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

Give me a chance baby
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright
Just for one more chance baby
I need all your lovin' tonight

Where are you now
The fears are comin' back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Takin' good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now
Hear me calling
I need you I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heart beat
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
Why don't you rescue me
Cold
Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now
Hear me calling
I need you I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heart beat
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
Why don't you rescue me
I'm so cold
Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now
Hear me calling
I need you I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heart beat
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

// Wild Nights. Hot And Crazy Days //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

I'm gonna break-out
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load

Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise

For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days

I'm feeling good tonight
I'm gonna cruise around
Makin' every head turn
Wind up the radio
I'm in the mood for some lovin'
Cause the night time's comin'

Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise

For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days

Come on
Gettin' hot tonight
Come on
That's right
Come on
There's no end in sight
Come on
Alright

I'm gonna break-out
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load

Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your tempature rise

For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days

// Hot For Love //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Twenty-four hours of the day
You're on my trail
And I can't get away
I can't shake you off
You're a wolf on the prowl
You got my scent and I can hear you howl

No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside

Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love

When the sun goes down,
I can feel your heat
Till the sun comes up
When you've got me worn deadbeat
I said I'm all burned out
I'm a physical wreck
But there you go again with your
Hot breath on my neck.

No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside

Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love

No where to run
No where to run
No where to run to
No where to run

No where to run
No where to hide
No where to go
No where to run to
No where to hide this hurt inside

Hot for love
Hot for love
Oh baby hot for love
Yes you're hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love

// Reckless //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

No one can stop me know
I'm like a human dynamo
Live wired and chargin' out with power
This time I won't hold back
I'm rarin' to get up and go
Fuelled up and growin' by the hour

Look out
I'm blastin' through the lines
Alive and kickin'
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm goin' from here until eternity

I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Comin' at gale force ten

Around me I feel the shock waves,
Building for the energy
A force field no one can break through
Solid as rock no wonder
I am indestructible
First placed in everything I do

Look out
I'm blastin' through the lines
Alive and kickin'
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm goin' from here until eternity

I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Comin' at gale force ten

Radioactive
I'm shootin' through the atmosphere
Takin' off
I'm headin' like a rocket through the stratosphere.

Look out
I'm blastin' through the lines
Alive and kickin'
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm goin' from here until eternity

I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Comin' at gale force ten
I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Comin' at gale force
Comin' at gale force ten
I'm feelin' reckless
Way outa hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Comin' at gale force
Comin' at gale force ten

// All Fired Up //

A burst of speed is all I need
To set me free
A flagging start that stirs the heart
To ecstasy

Raging away I'll go far
Time waits for no man
So reach for the stars
I'm all fired up

A bolt of light that sears the night
Of things supreme
To chase the sun, forever on
And live the dream

Forcing a system aside
Too fast for this life
My mind's open wide
I'm fired up

All fired up
Fired Up
All fired up

I'm soaring, freefalling
With all emotions roaring
Like lighting, like thunder
I'll rip the world asunder

Let's go
Hold on

[Lead Break]

I'm soaring, freefalling
With all emotions roaring
Like lighting, like thunder
I'll rip the world asunder

Raging away I'll go far
Time waits for no man
So reach for the stars
I'm fired up

All fired up
Fired up
All fired up
Fired up
