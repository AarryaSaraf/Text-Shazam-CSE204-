// Have A Talk With God //

There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to Him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God He cares
I know he does

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Thank you
Thank you very much

// Knocks Me Off My Feet //

I see us in the park 
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head 
And words from our hearts 
Told only to the wind felt even without being said 
I don't want to bore you with my trouble 
But there's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 

There's supmtin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 
Knocks me off my feet 

I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
More and more 

We lay beneath the stars 
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind 
I reach out for the part 
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find 
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble 
But there's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 

There's sumptin'bout your love 
That makes me weak and 
Knocks me off my feet 
Knocks me off my feet 

I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
Darling I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you 
Darling I don't want to bore you with it 
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you

// Summer Soft //

Summer soft...
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze

Morning rain...
Gently plays her rhythms on your window pane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October

And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play

Winter wind...
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers 'way with his breeze

Morning snow...
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you
But it breaks your heart in two
Cause you've been fooled by April

And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

// Ordinary Pain //

When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
In your heart
In your heart

[PART II]

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy you said no
or*di*nary pain
This little girl's mind you will blow
or*di*nary pain
But then I blew you out the box
or*di*nary pain
When I put my stuff on key and lock
or*di*nary pain
It makes me feel kind of sick
or*di*nary pain
To know love put you in a trick
or*di*nary pain
I knew our love would have to end
or*di*nary pain
The day I made it with your friend
or*di*nary pain
Giving your love to one unreal
or*di*nary pain
Like a big fool I know you feel
or*di*nary pain
But in this lovie-dovie game
or*di*nary pain
With all its joy there must be pain
or*di*nary pain
But now the time has surely come
or*di*nary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
or*di*nary pain
You're cryin' big crocodile tears
or*di*nary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
or*di*nary pain
When I was home waiting for you
or*di*nary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
or*di*nary pain
You know I'd really like to stay
or*di*nary pain
But like you did I've got to play
or*di*nary pain
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
or*di*nary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
or*di*nary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
or*di*nary pain
But to your music I can't dance
or*di*nary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
or*di*nary pain
About you blowin' what you had
or*di*nary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
or*di*nary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
or*di*nary pain

or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain
or*di*nary pain

// Saturn //

Packing my bags - going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch the people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold

I'm......
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learn to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they are dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

I'm......
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

// Ebony Eyes //

She's a Miss Beautiful Supreme 
A girl that other wish that they could be 
If there's seven wonders of the world 
Then I know she's gotta be number one 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

She's the sunflower of nature's seeds 
A girl that some men only find in their dreams 
When she smiles it seems the stars all know 
Cause one by one they start to light up the sky 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

A girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

When she starts talking soft and sweet 
Like birds of spring her words all seem to sing 
With a rhythm that is made of love 
And the happiness that she only brings 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

A girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony eyes 

Yeah, yea, yea 
.......yeah 
Pretty black beauty 
Yeah, yea yeah 
Yea, yea, yeah, yea, yea, yeah 
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah 
She's a girl that can't be beat 
Born and raised on ghetto streets 
She's a devastating beauty 
A pretty girl with ebony ey---es 
Ebony ey--es 
Ebony ey--es 
Ebony ey--es 
Ebony eyes

// Isn't She Lovely //

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love

// Joy Inside My Tears //

I've always come to the conclusion
That 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission
To lay something heavy on one's head

So I have tried to not be the one
Who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside
I think you should know

And baby that's you, you, you made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that
Tomorrow is for those
Who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday
And start living for today

I feel that lasting
Moments are coming
Far and few between
So I should tell you
Of the happiness that you bring

Baby, baby, it's you, you, you made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
Hey, you've brought some joy inside my tears

Gotta tell you, you, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought, you've brought, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby, baby, you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You made it, baby, you made it, baby, made it, made life's history
You, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
Nobody ever thought it would be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You, you, you made life's history
You have made
Gotta shout about it, baby
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

Oh, baby, you, you, you made life's history
You've brought some joy inside my tears

You've brought some joy inside my tears
Ah, ah, baby
You've brought some joy inside my tears

Uthando luyobusa
Jikelele kulomhlaba wethu

[Es Una Historia]
[Spanish translation by Raymond Maldonado]

Es una historia de mañana
Es una historia de amor
Es una historia que amor reinará
Por nuestro mundo
Es una historia de mi corazón

[I Am Singing]

There's songs to make you smile
There's songs to make you sad
But with a happy song to sing 
It never seems so bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me

I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart

Let's all sing someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts

// As //

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be loving you always 

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all that's born is new
Do know what I say is true 
That I'll be loving you always 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Always 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last through forever and another day 

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Always 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Always 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Always 
Until the day that is the day that are no more 

Did you know you're loved by somebody?

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Always 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
I'll be loving you forever 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Always 
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Always 

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed 

So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it 
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell 
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love 
And maybe our children's grandchildren 
And their great-great-grandchildren will tell 
I'll be loving you 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Loving you 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Loving you 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Be loving you 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Loving you 
Until the trees and seas up, up and fly away
Loving you 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Loving you 
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Loving you 

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Be loving you 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Loving you 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Loving you 
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Now ain't that loving you 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Ain't that loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
And I've got to say always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Always 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Always 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Always 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four 
Until the day that is the day that are no more 

Until the day the earth starts turning right to left 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through 
Until the day that you are me and I am you

// All Day Sucker //

Come on up, you say
'Cause you can feel your love coming down
I find myself rushing over to
Do something for your love

I knock on the door
You answer, asking, what am I there for?
I say, I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

You call me up to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And could I come over today to
Do something for your love?

One knock gets me in
But then you say how very nice it's been
That lets me know that I will, once again
Get nothing from your love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love

You drop by to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And if I had some time later in the day
To do something for your love

Anyone else would say
No, that's okay, but maybe by now
She'll see things my way and ask me to stay
To do something for her love

I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all day sucker
Coming to give something but to get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To get none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
You're being stingy with your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
I'm an all day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
Giving none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To an all day sucker for your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
To give none of your love

All day sucker for your love
All day sucker for your love
