// Never Had A Dream Come True //

I never, never had a dream come true
In my every dream, I'm loved by you
And we're free as the wind
And true love is no sin
Therefore, men are men, not machines
I never, never had a dream come true

Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue
Since our roads never crossed
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams
Do do do do do.........
I never, never had a dream come true

Yes, I'm gonna dream about you baby my whole life through
Seems my folks are ashamed
Said I ain't worth a thing
But I'm glad I'm chained to my dreams
Do do do do do..........
Keep on dreamin'
Sing along with me
Keep on dreamin'

// We Can Work It Out //

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

// Heaven Help Us All //

Heaven help the child who never had a home,
Heaven help the girl who walks the street alone
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,
Heaven help us all.

Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day,
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away,
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,
Heaven help us all.

Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call
Oh, yeah!

Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one,
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun.
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall,
Lord, Heaven help us all.

Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call.

Now I lay me down before I go to sleep.
In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep, keep hatred from the mighty,
And the mighty from the small,
Heaven help us all.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!
Heaven help us all.

// You Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover //

Hey there miss fine
Sweet little clinging vine
Your actions kind of show me you love me truly, yeah
You're warmer than July, sweet as apple pie
I can't let you know you're getting to me

Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
My papa used to say
"look child, look beyond a tender smile"
'Cause can't judge a book by it's lover

Girl, I'm sweet on you
Though you can't see through
this unconcerned expression I've been wearing
Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
And you can't judge a book by it's lover
Maybe my coldness is a mask, maybe your loving will last
But can't judge a book by it's cover

Somewhere beyond the skin, somewhere deep within
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves
And maybe we'll find something precious
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
Only time it's gonna show, only time will let us know
'Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
And you can't judge a book by it's lover
We've got to search each other's minds
We've got to read between the lines
Oh, take a different look
And make our hearts an open book
Oh, you can't judge a book by it's cover
No, no, no, no
And you can't judge a book by it's lover

// Don't Wonder Why //

You never see, the little sparkle, in my eye
I wonder why
Sometimes I wish, you stop and hold me,
But you pass right by
I wonder why

I tried, everything I could,
I even change my walk,
The way that I stood
But you, pass by me, and pretend that you don't even see me
But I want you to know (Uuuummmm)

If one day you decide to smile,
And say hello and I say goodbye (Uuuummmm)
Don't wonder why my baby (no) Don't wonder why my baby

When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears, to my eyes
I just can't seem to make you happy, no matter how hard I try
I wonder why

Seems like, no matter what I do, it's never good, enough for you
My pain, it shows loud, but it still can't let go now,
But I want you to know, now

Nights grow old and winds blow cold, so old if my loves grows cold
And I, don't wonder why my baby (woooo) baby don't wonder why
Oh yeah!

(Yeaaahhh) Seems like, no matter what I do, I'm never, never, never, never,
Never good enough for you
My pain it shows loud, oh you know I still just no matter I just can't let go
Now, but I want you to know!!!
Love me baby

Nights grow old and winds blow cold, and so old, if my love grows cold
And I've, don't wonder why baby
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why my baby
Baby don't wonder why, don't wonder why my baby
Don't wonder why ,my baby
No, no, no, no don't wonder why my baby (Ooohhh)
Don't wonder why my baby
Can you hear me, can you hear me

// Anything You Want Me To Do //

// I Can't Let My Heaven Walk Away //

I can't let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone

Called her name but I called in vain
I know she can't answer from a picture frame
Only an hour ago I held her in real flesh and blood
She just grabbed her coat and said please I've had enough

She kept me well like a Sunday prayer
Just like my own right hand the girl was always there
To every man but me her eyes were blind
I was in the promise land long before my time

I can't let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone

I accused my baby of being a liar
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial
I only asked her to hear her tell me no
But my question back-fired, I didn't expect her to go

I cant let my heaven walk away
Just cant let my heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my heaven gone
[Repeat]

// Joy (Takes Over Me) //

You can bet you're sweeter than ever
And your love is making it better
I can feel it in my bones
Oooh each time we're alone

Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
Cause joy, joy takes over me

Through thick and thin I'll stand
Loving you always
Yes I need you mama
To take the heartache away
I know the sun's gon' shine
And as long as you're mine
It's joy, joy, joy I feel inside

Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud
Ooh baby baby baby babe
Like a spinning top
I can't stop
Just loving you
You know Stevie loves you
Needs you baby oh yeah

You know my love is sure to live
Ain't goin' nowhere
And I do believe girl
You were meant for me

Cause I live in ecstasy
And my soul refuses sleep
Cause joy, joy takes over me

Oh baby joy
Joy, joy, joy, joy
Joy joy joy joy joy joy
The way you love me joy
Takes over me
Oh the way you love me
The way you need me
Baby please don't leave me
I get joy.

// I Gotta Have A Song //

Got no place to be
No one's needing me
My girl just said we're through
Love was here to stay
Only yesterday
Today my world is blue

So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song

Had a happy home
Now it's turned to stone
Kitchen's cold and bare
She'd cook all day for me
I still hurry home to see
But I know that she's not there

So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song

Show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music, I just can't go wrong
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
A happy happy song
[Repeat]

// Something To Say //

There is something, that I'd like to say to you
There are people, who will try to put us down
They will tell us were too young to see it through girl
Try to make us cry
But don't you worry
You have me and I have you

Well there is something that I think you ought to know
There are people, who will say our love won't grow oh no
It's important that you face them with a smile girl
And you tell them
Hunny maybe someday lovin just might be worth while
Whoa yeah
Well there is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby
They can't hurt us, though I know they'll try
And it will work out
But they won't know why
And there is something to our love that just can't die

It's important that you face them with a smile girl
And you tell them hunny
Maybe someday, lovin just might be worth while
Oh baby
There is something that I'd like to say
And there is something that we can do today
And there is one thing that I know has come our way
Oh baby!
There is something that I'd like to do
Well there is something just for me and you
Yes there is something that I'd like to say to you
Oh ohhhhhh oh

And there is something that we can do today
And there is something that I'd like to say to you
