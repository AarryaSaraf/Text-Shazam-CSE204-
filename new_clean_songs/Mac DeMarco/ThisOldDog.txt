// My Old Man //

Look in the mirror
Who do you see?
Someone familiar
Surely not me
For it can't be me
Look how old and cold and tired and lonely he's become
Not until you see
There's a price tag hanging off of having all that fun

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Walk on the outside, holding her hand
Someone familiar, her and her man
But it just can't be
Look at all the steps that brought you where you are today
Not until you see
As a heart grows stronger, sometimes love is pushed away

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me
Oh no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in me

// This Old Dog //

Sometimes my love may be put on hold
Sometimes my heart may seem awful cold
These times come and these times go
As long as I live, all you need to know is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beating in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

Often a heart tends to change its mind
A new day decides on a new design
A new day gets set on another way
As long as I live, all I've got to say is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beating in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

// Baby You're Out //

Of all the things you wished you'd never done
I've heard you say that this is number one
Another life down another road
Perhaps you're better off to never know

Don't dream of all the ways things could have been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

There's nothing to cry about
'Cause baby, baby, you're out

You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints
But what you voice is what will drive your fate
And old things never really got that bad
Dreams of greener grass'll drive you mad

Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

There's nothing to cry about
'Cause baby, baby, you're out

Baby, you're out
Baby, you're out
Baby, you're out

// For The First Time //

While she's been away
Living day-to-day has been tough
I found her at my side
Simply being alive has been rough

Know she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out-of-town has been hard
But somehow this old heart found time to work it out this far

No, I know she's coming home soon
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

// One Another //

Hey kid, everybody's prone to some mistakes
If you'd always kept it straight, you'd never learn
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take
Don't feel like all the time you put in went to waste
The way your heart was beating all those days
And suddenly it beats another pace

It's not like you never tried to forget her
But these days are better without one another

Hey man, so now you've got it off your chest
Your heart can finally get some rest
Same heart that started this whole mess
And although a broken heart needs time to mend
Yours wasn't ever really broken, was it?
In losing love you gain a friend

It's not like you never tried to forget her
But these days are better without one another

Without one another
Without one another
Without one another

// Still Beating //

I never meant to make her cry
And now I'm seeing tears in her eyes
Half and half, make-believe
'Cause so she thought that my heart was on my sleeve

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

I never thought some silly songs could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune for anybody else out there but you

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it

Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

// Sister //

Turns out not every dog has his day
So sad, so suddenly gone away
Wish there were more that I could do
Any time you're hearing this
Sister, know my heart goes out to you

// Dreams From Yesterday //

Once your dreams
Come knocking at your door
It's time to realize
You aren't dreaming anymore
And once your life, set to settle down
Take a look around you
No more dreaming to be found

So why then, are you crying?
It was you
Who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

Once a life, these has got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
Rest up sleepy head
Might as well be dead

So why then, are you crying?
It was you
Who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

// A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes //

Just trying to keep it light sometimes casts a shadow
Trouble is keeping quiet and you know well where your heart goes
The trouble's with meeting anybody, these days are bringing you down
All predisposed to believe him in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

Don't let the world outside the windowpane get to your head
Hopefully you make some sense of all this shit before you're dead
The trouble's with meeting anybody, follow wherever you go
All predisposed to believe him in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

// One More Love Song //

Another turn, another shift
One last kiss from her lips
Another dream you're putting down
After all this time, it turns out all you found

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

Another try, another go
Never thought you'd feel this low
Another dream put to bed
After all this time, it turns out all you had

Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

One more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

// On The Level //

Boy, this could be your year
Make an old man proud of you
Forget about the tears

On the level
See me eye-to-eye
Stand up like a man
Even from the other side

On the level
On the level

Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance
Never had a voice

On the level
Carrying a name
Fall until my final day
Who's there left to blame?

On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level

// Moonlight On The River //

I'd say, see you later, if I thought I'd see you later
And I'd tell you, that I loved you, if I did
It's so strange, deciding, how to feel about it
It's such strange, emotion, standing there beside it

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

I'd say, see you next time, if I thought there were a next time
Easy conversation, ain't exactly where we're at
It's so strange, deciding, how I feel about you
It ain't like, I ain't used, to going on without you

I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

// Watching Him Fade Away //

Haven't got the guts to call him up
Walk around as if you never cared in the first place
But if you never call you'll end up stuck
Without another chance to tell him off right to his face

And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away

I know you never meant to put him down
And even if you did, he sure deserved it
The thought of him no longer being around
Well sure it would be sad but not really different

And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away
