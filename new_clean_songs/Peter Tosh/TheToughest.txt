// Can't You See //

Told me you loved me
Right from the start
Don't play no tricks
Don't break my heart

Told me you loved me
And I said why
You think I'm gonna cry

[Chorus:]
Can't you see
What you're doing to me
I am bound
You've got to set me free

You jerk on my heart
Shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame

Told me you loved me
To make my cry
And I said I don't know why

[Chorus]

Then if you love me
Don't treat me so bad
I could give you something you never had

See you sitting up there
And you're looking so mad
Your imagination is making you sad

[Chorus]

// Maga Dog //

[Chorus:]

But a young nay like you

// Shame And Scandal //

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
In much confusion as you will see
It was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to merry and a wive of his own
He found a young girl suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
Soon the best cook in the island he found
He went to his papa to make a day
His papa shook his head and to him he say
You can't merry that girl, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

He went to his mama and covered his head
And told his mama what his papa has said
His mama she laughs she said go man go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

// Don't Look Back //

If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't kill your faith in love
Remembering what's become

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Places behind you
There to remind you

If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
Gonna heal your faith in love
Remembering what's been done

But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

[Talking:]
How far you been walkin' now
About 100 miles
You still got some more to walk
I know, I got a little more to go
I'm gettin' kind of tired but I got to keep on walkin'
I'm walkin' barefoot
You've got to walk and don't look back

// 400 Years //

400 years (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
And it's the same -
The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years;
(400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)
And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see.
Why do they fight against the poor youth of today?
And without these youths, they would be gone -
All gone astray

Come on, let's make a move:
(make a move, make a move. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come,
And if-a fools don't see
(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.

Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)
That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see.
Said, it's four hundred long years - (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy.
It's been 400 years, (400 years, 400 years)
Wait so long! Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o.
How long? 400 long, long years.
