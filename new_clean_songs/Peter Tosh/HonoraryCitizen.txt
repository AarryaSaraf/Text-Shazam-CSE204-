Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up

You, preacher man don't tell me

Cause you know most people think
A great God will come from the skies
Take away everything
And left everybody dry

But if you know what life is worth
Then you would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light

[Chorus]

We're sick and tired of this game of technology
Humbly asking Jesus for his mercy
We know and we know and understand
Almighty Jah is a living man

You fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights

// Johnny B. Goode //

Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville
Back up in the woods, on top of a hill
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

He never learned to read and a-write so well
But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell, yell

Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track
Old engineer in the train sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that them drivers made

People passing by would stop and say
Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play

Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight

Mama said: Son, you gotta be a man
You gotta be the leader of a reggae band
People coming in from miles around
To hear you play until the sun goes down

Boy, someday, your name will be in the lights
Saying: Johnny B. Goode tonight

Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight

// No Nuclear War //

[Chorus:]
No Nuclear War
We don't want no nuclear war
With nuclear war we won't get far
I said that We don't want no nuclear war
With nuclear war we won't get far
Said no, just another holocaust
It's just another holocaust
And we can't take no more

Too many people are hungry
They don't have food to eat
They are naked
'Cause they don't have clothes to wear

They are going insane
Because of the condition
A million babies
Are suffering from malnutrition

[Chorus]

I can't take no more

I saw World War One
Where lotsa trouble begun
I saw World War Two
When the pirates came right through

Lookin' for World War Three
But you got to set me free
Free from the chains
And this here misery

[Chorus]

We can't take no more

Unemployment
I said the rate is high
So much sick people
I'm sure they gonna die

So much mad people
Gettin' ready to explode
'Fore somebody
Come help them carry this load

[Chorus]

One country deploying MX
Another country deploying SS
Inflation goin' way up high
And the dollar is going way down low

[Chorus]

Crying, bawling, they can't take no more
I hear them moaning they can't take no more
They don't wanna die
They want to go to Heaven, yeah

But they can't
They can't take no more
They gettin' low
They can't take no more

They gettin' grief
They can't take no more
They gettin' beat
They can't take no more

They gettin' lazy
Cause they can't take no more
Bored
They can't take no more

Frustrated
They can't take no more
Pleading for them
They can't take no more

Can't you hear me pleading for them
Cause they can't take no more

They want to live in peace
And happiness
Let the trees grow
Let the waters flow...

Kibir amlak

Lebdama mabrak isad
Tenayistilgn
Kings of kings, lords of lords
Conquering lion of the tribe of judah
Elect of god, mighty god
Everliving god, earth's rightul ruler

Blessed be the man that walk'eth not
In the counsel of the ungodly
Nor stand'eth in the ways of sinners
Nor sitt'eth in the seat of the scornful
For I delight is in the law of the lord god, Selassie I
In his laws do I meditate day and night
Therefore I must be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water
And bring'eth forth fruit in due season
I locks also shall not wither
And whatsoever I do'eth shall prosper
The weak heart are not so, oh no!
They are like the chaff that the wind driv'eth away
Therefore no weak heart shall stand in the judgment
Nor no sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the lord god so high
That he know'eth the way of the righteous
And know that the way of the weak heart
Shall crumble, paralyze and burn

Jah Rastafari!
But he delight in earthquake, brimstone and fiyah
To kill, crum

Jah! mighty god! everliving god!

And do away with all weak heart
Conception to my creation continually
And let our righteousness cover this earth
As the waters cover the sea Isaiah 11:9

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord,
As the waters cover the sea.
He reigns from that iwa until this iwa
Hailful I, so high and so mighty

Jah Rastafari!
I am the earth rightful ruler

// You Can't Fool Me Again //

First you came and you sold us Christianity
But all your members just lust after vanity
Telling them to trust in you faithfully
Not seeing it's the return of the slavery
Taught us of heaven way up in the sky
Where we can't reach unless we die
But you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me

Of things you taught me in school
There's so much to make me a fool
But if I was a mule
I know I'd be used as a tool
I said that, you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again, and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, you can't fool me
You draw and object on piece of a paper
Said I'm to serve it as lord and as savior
Tell me of a heaven way up in the sky
Where I can't reach unless I die
You can't fool me again
I said you can't fool me, you can't fool me
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me

You said Humpty sat up on a wall
You say Humpty, he had a fall
You said that cow, jump over moon
And the dish ran away with the spoon
But I know you can't fool me again
You can't...

// Black Dignity //

Lagidamawi rasfetari, medhani alem

Negus nagast, izi Itiopia

Lift up thine head, o ye black dignity
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-loving black dignity
And let the King of kings enter thine heart

For in a little while and the wicked shall not be
They shall be cut off like the grass
And wither like the green herb
So trust in the Lord and do good
And wait patiently for Him
And verily thou shalt prevail, Selah

I branches shall not wither
And whatsoever I do shall prosper
I shall be like a tree, planted by the rivers
That bringeth forth fruit in season, Selah

So lift up thine head, o ye black people
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-loving black people
And the King of kings shall come in, Selah
Wake up thine slumbering mentality
Come closer to reality

Recognize thy dignity, thy integrity, thy quality
Fret not because of one who prospereth in his way
For in a little while
The evil-doers shall be killed crum [?] paralyzed
Love Him and live, hate Him and die

Lift up thine head, ye ever-loving black people
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-living black people
And the Lord, God shall come into thine heart
Seek Him and ye shall find Him 'cause He can be found
Wake up thine slumbering mentality and live up to reality

Live black, love black, think black
Our God is black

// Here Comes The Sun //

Little darling
It's been a long, long lonely winter
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Little darling
The smiles are returning to their places
Little darling
It seems like years since they've been there

But here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

Little darling
I see the ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since they've been there

And here comes the sun
There goes the snow and I say
It's alright
It's alright

I see the ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since they've been there

Here comes the sun
There goes the snow and I say
It's alright
It's alright

Little darling
The smiles are returning to their places
Little darling
It seems like years since they've been there

Here comes the sun
I said, here comes the sun and I say
It's alright

// Leave My Business //

Wake up one morning and don't have no tea
Me no want no one come sorry for me
That's nobody's business but my own
The other day comes and it happens the same
Don't think that I'm going to feel ashamed
That's nobody's business but my own

So you better leave my business, leave my business
Leave my business and mind your own

If I get high and fly like bird
You should never say a word
That's nobody's business but my own
And if you drink rum and tumble down
You alone go and have your fun
That's nobody's business but your own

When landlord come collecting rent
Me not come beg you fifty cent
That's nobody's business but my own
And if he says that I'm to move
That won't stop me from improve
That's nobody's business but my own

Leave my business, leave my business
Leave my business and mind your own

The King of glory shall come in

Arise Blackman, arise

Every man on earth is a man
And every tub have to stand on its own bottom
No matter where you're from, Blackman arise

So arise Blackman, arise

// Once Bitten //

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
I say, "The same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening"

So I'm a, once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
Once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

I don't want to hear
A word you say
'Cause I told you long before
It wouldn't work out that way

And now you coming to me
With tears in your eyes
One thing I got to tell you
Step back with your lies

'Cause I'm a once bitten and I'm twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
I'm a once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

Anything I tell you
You always doubt me
But now you found out too late
You couldn't do without me

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
I say, "The same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening"

So I'm a once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
Once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening

Let Jah be praised

He watereth the hills

Jah made the herb for man [x3]

Fret not thyself

neither be thou envious
against the workers of inequity
for they shall soon be cut down
cut down like grass
and they shall wither like corn

Let Jah arise

// (You Gotta Walk And) Don't Look Back //

If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't kill your faith in love
Remembering what's become

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Places behind you
There to remind you

If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
Gonna heal your faith in love
Remembering what's been done

But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

[Talking:]
How far you been walkin' now
About 100 miles
You still got some more to walk
I know, I got a little more to go
I'm gettin' kind of tired but I got to keep on walkin'
I'm walkin' barefoot
You've got to walk and don't look back

// Fools Die //

The lips of the righteous teaches many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in the city

Vexation of the soul is vanity
Destruction of the poor is their poverty
The poor man's wealth is in a holy place

Why do you fight each other?
Why do you kill your brother?
Then your reward will be the cemetery

We got to build a better nation
Clean up, clean up Jah creation
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

// Honorary Citizen //

He was a decent lawfull upright honorary citizen

He deserves respect
Gotta give him respect

Peter Tosh 

He fought for the repressed 
In his music
In his words
He was brutalized
For what he thought was right
For what he thought was true

He was a true prophet
In his music
In his words

He was a rebel 
With a cause
A righteous rastaman

One who did not compromise
To save the world
