// Nights On Broadway //

Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us?

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away

Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town (oh those nights)

I will wait
Even if it takes forever
I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
You never-ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds (oh yeah yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (yeah)

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

// Wind Of Change //

In the streets of New York City
Every man can feel the cold
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told

And the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
Being born in a world of joy?

But like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
'Til he finds out why he don't belong
But like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share

Sometimes, a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?

Do you understand what I'm saying?
We need a god down here
A man to lead us, children
Take us from the valley of fear

Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Help us survive, make us arrive
Teach us what we need to know

But like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
'Til he finds out why he don't belong
But like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share

Sometimes, a man breaks down
Down, down down, down
And the good things he's searching for
Are crushed into the ground

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
Get on up, look around

// Songbird //

Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before
Though your wings are broken
The sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you
Like an open door

Though you go so far away
Your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know
How beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise
I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will
And if he really did, how far

Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before
Though your wings are broken
The sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you
Like an open door

Though you go so far away
Your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know
How beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise
I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will
And if he really did, how far

Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird
Through the open door

Go on with your song, bird
You can't go wrong my bird
You will go on and on, bird
Like you did before

Like you did before

// Fanny (Be Tender With My Love) //

First I rise, then I fall
Seems like you don't want the love
Of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

So you say to yourself, boy
You're out of your brain
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
All night in the rain?
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want I'll take you there

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh, with our love
You made a promise
You'll always love me forever

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love

// All This Making Love //

About an hour or more
When I go upstairs
You can read between the lines
I can make it to the top
But then I gotta stop
But I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine
And all this making love

In a day or so
It'll really show
Gonna wear me to the ground
It's just the way it goes
She keeps me on my toes
But I'm all right

And should I mind
It's just the wine
And all this making love

And I can't keep still
Gonna make a will
'Cause I'm losing all my hair
I try to make it seem
It isn't just a dream
And I'm all right

I'm almost there
It isn't fair
To wake up all this making love

I get pleasure and pain
It's a gravy train
It's a wonderland, it's a ride
And the rumor is I'm told
She's really got a hold
And I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine
And all this making love

She'll be making me strung by the tip of my tongue
Like a tiger in a cage
She's got me up a wall
I'm slowing to a crawl
But I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine
And all this making love

Too much too much too much too much

// Country Lanes //

So warm is my morning sun, red is my rainbow
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding
Like a light in the storm

Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love

Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you

My life has meaning now, I am a window
And all things seem clear to me now
Like a light in the storm

Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love

Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love

Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you

// Come On Over //

If my life gets like a jig saw
With the pieces out of place

Come on over
Put a smile back on my face

And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do

Come on over
Baby, you will see me through

And if you think I need you
Come on over

Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears

And if you think I need you
Come on over

Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

When I cannot see in front of me
And I know my darkest day

Come on over
You can take it all away
And if you think I need you
Come on over

Bring your love around
You can wipe away my tears

And if you think I need you
Come on over

Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

Come on over

// Edge Of The Universe //

Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't wanna bring her
And I know it'll make her worse

Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air

Well, I'm ten feet tall
But I'm only three feet wide
And I live inside an ocean that flows
On the other side

If I came back down tomorrow
Would it all be far too soon?
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon

I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on prayin'
I couldn't stop to turn around
Well, here I am and here I'm stayin'

It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light

Well, I know this may sound crazy
But I'm sure I got here first
I'm just me, Shenandora
At the edge of the universe

I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on prayin'
I couldn't stop to turn around
Well, here I am and here I'm stayin'

Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't wanna bring her
And I know it'll make her worse

Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air

At the edge of the universe

// Baby As You Turn Away //

Here am I one sad and lonely guy
One shadow of the man I used to be

Now it's past, the love I thought would last
You thought I had you chained
And now you're free

I know it's wrong but I'm still holding on
Still praying you will soon come back to me

But then you go, you let your feelings show
You said I gave you pain, and now I see

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart

And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, making me try, try to make
You stay as you turn away

Now you're gone, this road I walk upon is just
Another place where I can hide

I'm still your man, there's proof of who I am
Except without your love I'm dead inside

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart

And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, watching me try, try to make
You stay as you turn away
