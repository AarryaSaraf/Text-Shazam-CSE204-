// Jive Talkin' //

It's just your jive-talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive-talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive-talkin', so misunderstood, yeah
Jive-talkin', you're really no good

Oh, my child, you'll never know
Just what you mean to me
Oh, my child, you got so much
You gonna take away my energy

With all your jive-talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin' still gets in my eyes
Nobody believes what you say
It's just your jive-talkin' that gets in the way (Oh my)

Oh, my love, you're so good
Treating me so cruel
There you go with your fancy lies
Leavin' me lookin' like a dumbstruck fool

With all your jive-talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive-talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive-talkin', so misunderstood, yeah
Jive-talkin', you just ain't no good

And if there's somebody you'll love 'til you die
Then all that jive-talkin' just gets in your eye, yeah (Woo)

Jive-talkin', you're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin' still gets in my eyes

And if there's somebody you'll love 'til you die
Then all that jive-talkin' just gets in your eye, yeah, yeah

// Stayin' Alive //

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

And now it's all right. It's OK
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin'
And everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk

Well, now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose

You know it's all right. It's OK
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin'
And everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
(Hey, yeah)

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

And now it's all right. It's OK
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin'
And everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
(Hey, yeah)

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

// How Deep Is Your Love //

I know your eyes in the mornin' sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn (I really mean to learn)
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

// Night Fever //

Listen to the ground:
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
I give you warnin'

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never baby, don't you know)

Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never baby, don't you know)

Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)

// More Than A Woman //

Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman
More than a woman to me, baby
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ahh

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Yes you are, baby)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ahh

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me, yeah
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Every day of my life)
More than a woman (Ohh baby)
More than a woman to me, yeah (You are, you are, you are)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (She treats me good, like a love should)
More than a woman (Yeah)
More than a woman to me (Yeah baby)

// Open Sesame //

Tried every way to get your love
everything in my power
even prayed to the man above
Broke my baby's heart for you
divided my family
cause Women like you are so few
gave up right for wrong
the silly dreams I had
that someday your heart I'll own

Open Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
open Sesame
Open your heart
Let love invade it's privacy
Opens Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Set your heart free

I need you girl
your rejection is like a twister
tearing up my whole world
blowing away the leaves
From the trees of happiness
took the sweetness of my heart
and left it with bitterness
said you wanted to love me
But, wasn't strong enough
to open the doors to flow free

Open Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Open your heart
Let love invade it's privacy
Open Sesame
Only if I were a Jennie
Open Sesame
Set your hear free

// Disco Inferno //

(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)

To my surprise one hundred storeys high
People getting loose y'all
Getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control
It was so entertaining
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
(Burnin)
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
