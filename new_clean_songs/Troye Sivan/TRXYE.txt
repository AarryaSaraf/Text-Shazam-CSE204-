// Happy Little Pill //

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

// Touch //

Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
And I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest

Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
And the time is moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, I reach out and touch

My mind's gone on racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump,
Yeah, I'm ready to swim

Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
New hands need to build them

My mind's gone on running
My hands cut loose
Yeah, but there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do

And I need you to trust
That I'm lost and we must
Get past all these rules
We must choose
To reach out and touch

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, reach out and...

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I reach, I reach out and touch

// Fun //

But don't you wanna see the world, boy
All the countries and the stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh I swear you'll feel alive, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun

When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
'Til they put you in the ground, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun,
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun
Let's go have fun

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Fun, you and me in the old Jeep,
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

// Gasoline //

I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head

I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, try to forget it
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I'm feeling stressed

I need to do something
I fucked up for nothing
Now I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Oh, no, like gasoline

Wake up the morning after
You call but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try

You deserve forever
not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I'mma try to keep you near

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, just like gasoline

// The Fault In Our Stars (MMXIV) //

[Verse 1:]
The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm okay...

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Verse 2:]
You lost, a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Bridge x3:]
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
For one more minute, don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

[Chorus:]
(I don't want to let) And I don't want to let this go
(I don't want to lose) I don't want to lose control
(And I just want to see) I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

And I don't want to say (don't want to say) goodbye
Someone tell me why (tell me why)
I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

With you
