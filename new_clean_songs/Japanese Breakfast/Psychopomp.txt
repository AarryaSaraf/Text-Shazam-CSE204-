Album: Psychopomp

// Heft //

I wanna churn like
Amish butter
I wanna move out
Of your way
I wanna find what's
There in your stomach
If it's the same dark
And it's too late

What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark
What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark oh fuck it all then

I spent the summer
Trying to be sweeter
I spent the summer
Staying in
I went a mile, I'm on another
Spent my nights by hospital beds

What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark
What if?
It's the same dark coming, the same dark then fuck it all

// In Heaven //

The dog's confused
She just paces around all day
She's sniffing at your empty room

I'm trying to believe
When I sleep it's really you
Visiting my dreams
Like they say that angels do

I came here for the long haul
Now I leave here as an empty fucking hole

Oh do you believe in heaven?
Like you believed in me
Oh it could be such heaven
If you believed it was real

Is there something you can do with yourself
As I sift through the debris
While I empty every shelf
And flounder in the muck that I'll be drowning in so soon
You can't watch me from the banks then
Turn to say you're swimming too

Come here for the long haul
Now I leave here just an empty goddamn hole

How do you believe in heaven?
Like you believe in me?
Oh it could be such heaven
If you believed it was real

// The Woman That Loves You //

You're embarrassing me
With a postponed marriage and a stalled out car
Then you leave me in the back with half a window rolled down
Like a dog (like a dog) in the summer heat

Don't you think? Don't you think
You should try to do as little harm as you can to the woman that loves you

Oh, we'll stay
Oh, we'll stay together
For the weekend, honey
The weekend, babe
Me and you, frosted blues
But we're gazing out for better things

You should try to do as little harm as you can to the woman that loves you

// Rugged Country //

666 sixteen-year-old kids huddled around the grocery lot
"He punched out my teeth" so you said, so did the evidence
The blood and the dent on the car door from your head

And this is where I bring you
With every laurel I've hung from your neck
It will be the noose that hangs you
Yes it will be the noose that hangs you

Cause I was lonely here and it's lonely still
In the rugged country where the weeds grow fierce
Quicker than the crop I keep running from
In this rugged country
I'm the rugged one

And this is where we lost you
Despite every effort to bring you back
And the hope's the one that haunts you
And this home's the rope that's wrapped around your neck
And it will be the noose that hangs you
Yes it will be the noose to hang you

And it's a heavy hand where I wear your death
As a wedding ring in the rugged country
I tend to your man in the home you had
Oh in this rugged country
I'm the rugged one

// Everybody Wants To Love You //

Can I get your number?
Can I get you into bed?
When we wake up in the morning
Will you give me lots of head?

Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you!

Will you lend me your toothbrush?
Will you make me breakfast in bed?
Ask me to get married
And then make me breakfast again!

Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you!

// Jane Cum //

In a year I'll say "your hair got long"
And you'll tell me how the band got good
Like dust kicked up from a tire

Full force through the high beams
I was rushing from phantom pain
Sweat away our clothes hatching

Jane Cum you swallow me whole
Jane Cum swallow

Soulless animal keep feeding on my meat
All my tiny bones between your teeth

Jane Cum you swallow me whole
Jane Cum swallow

// Triple 7 //

Don't you know you'll never be the same
I look for you through the work week
And I love a man in uniform
And he loves me like a slot machine
From the valley of loose women in the cruel light of morning

You call out my name like something from the bottom of a well
Oh how they want, how they need
How they cling to my sleeves til they're lacerated sails
But in the night I am someone else

Don't you know I'll always be this way
A pure woman is hard to find, to come by these days
And I know the looks of urge and scorn
And I know the role I'm meant to play
The role of the other woman who will spend her life longing

Call out my name
Like something from the bottom of a well
How I want, how I need
How I cling to your sleeves
Till they're all fucked beyond repair
But in the night I am someone else
