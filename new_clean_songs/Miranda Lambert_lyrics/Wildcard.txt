// White Trash //

I'm finally on the up and up
A little 401K
Traded in my trailer park
For a neighborhood with a gate
Queen finally got her castle
Last one on the right, you can't miss it
Upgraded from the barbed wire
Now I got a nice picket

I can play high class all day
But some things never change

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep it clean on Sundays
And keep the lights and water on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

Carnations from the flowerbed
In a whiskey bottle vase
Cadillac on a cinder block
Duct tape on every other thing
Real ferns in the sunroom
Bug zapper by the screen
Dog hair on the Restoration Hardware
Who says you can't have nice things

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep my roots from showing
But I'm still dishwater blonde
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

New money old habits
Love seat in the plastic
Steak fingers in a basket
New money old habits

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep it clean on Sundays
And keep the lights and water on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

Got more rooms than the Joneses
Ya'll and I'm still adding on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

I'm finally on the up and up
I'm finally on the up and up
Up and up, up and up, up and up...

// Mess With My Head //

I had the palace looking nice and neat
Two feather pillows with expensive sheets
Sitting so pretty on my velvet couch
Before you came around

You treat my mind like a hotel room
And I know why I gave the keys to you

I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my head

Maybe it's wrong but it feels right to me
Reveling in reverse psychology
You complicate it with your lying lips
I'm waiting on a kiss

I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my bed
Waking up to a wreck with blue jeans on the floor
If it ain't love then I like it better than before
I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my

You treat my mind like a hotel room
And I know why I gave the keys to you

I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my bed
Waking up to a wreck with blue jeans on the floor
If ain't love then I like it better than before
I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my head
I let you mess with my, mess with my head

// It All Comes Out In The Wash //

If you wear a white shirt to a crawfish boil
Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops

If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it

'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak, no matter how messy it got
You take the sin, and the men, and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin

You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A.1. Sauce on her table cloth, don't sweat it
A Tide stick will get it

It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak, no matter how messy it got
You take the sin, and the men, and you throw 'em all in
And then you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
You gotta put that sucker on spin

And the laundry list goes like this
Every teardrop, every white lie
Every dirty cotton sheet, let it line dry
All the mistakes, all the wild streaks
That's why the good Lord made bleach
Oh, oh

'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
(All come out in the wash)
Every little stain, every little heartbreak, no matter how messy it got
You take the sin, and the men, and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
Put that sucker on spin
Yeah, put that sucker on spin

Yeah, you put that sucker on spin
And around and around and around and around we go
'Round and around and around and around we go

// Settling Down //

Should I give up sunsets
For marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows
Or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway
Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe
Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort?
Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you?
Am I looking the other way?

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?
Am I settling up
Or settling down?

I could plant a pretty garden
Or just send myself flowers
Be a jet set Friday
Or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely
Or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence
If it wrapped around the world

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?

Am I looking for comfort?
Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you?
Am I looking the other way?

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?
Am I settling up
Or settling down?

// Holy Water //

They're sellin' snake oil from the pulpit
At the church on Main
They're makin' deals with the devil
In the good Lord's name

I'm stuck at home missing a dirty soul cleansing
Ain't got a dime for the tithe
I believe amusing personal communion
Can lead you right to the light

Give me some of that holy water
A bit of that holy water
Just a nip on that holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown

They're pushin' concrete at the courthouse
Whether you like it or not
So tell the bank man to cash your pay-check
So you can piss in a pot

I'm stuck at home wishin' I could just go fishin'
And throw some bait on the line
You can't skip a stone where the rivers all but gone
And there ain't even a cloud in the sky

Give me some of that holy water
Just a bit of that holy water
A nip of that holy water
Holy water's gonna make us drown

Take us down

I need a sip of that holy water
Just a bit of that holy water
Just a nip of that holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown

I want hit of that holy water
A sip of that holy water
Get a grip of that holy water
Gonna drink it till we finally drown

I'm gonna drink it till I finally drown

It's gonna take us down
Ho-ho-ho-oh, holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown

// Way Too Pretty For Prison //

They don't have rhinestone ball and chains
Lunch trays don't come with Chardonnay
The bars there ain't got boys to buy us drinks

We'd stick out like two bottled blondes
I must admit it don't sound fun
For fifteen girls to have to share one sink

He cheated, he's a villain
And you know I'd help you kill him

But we're way too pretty for prison
Hard time ain't our kind of living
And I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

Antifreeze and Gatorade
Arsenic in his lemonade
Takes just one snip to bleed his brakes
But we ain't gonna do it
(She ain't gonna do it)

Yeah, we've been watching too much TV
You ain't Thelma, I ain't Louise
But if we ask 'em they'd both agree
We should put him through it
(Don't put him through it)

He cheated, he's a villain
So let's hire somebody to kill him

'Cause we're way too pretty for prison
Yeah, hard time ain't our kind of living
And I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da
La de da da
La de da da da

Well, the state won't pay for lash extensions
No Sun Tan City, not to mention
That lack of waxing situation
Oh oh

'Cause we're way too pretty for prison
Hard time ain't our kind of living
I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're way too pretty for prison

La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da da
(La de da da da)
La de da da
La de da da
La de da da da

La de da da da
La de da da da
La de da da
La de da da

// Locomotive //

I'm like a locomotive
I don't run out of steam
I'm headed toward the reservoir
And I'm gonna need a drink

I ain't no Napa Valley
New York City seems okay
I'm a little bit more Tennessee
And there's whiskey in my veins

I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
But I ain't givin' up
And I totaled his truck
But he loves me just the same
Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings

I ain't no grand piano
I play a little out of tune
I spent all of my glory days
In a Honky Tonk saloon

Now I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
But I ain't givin' up
Got a heart like a truck
I'm a hummingbird ready to sing

Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings

I'm sweet tea sippin'
On the front porch sittin'
While my hubby fries chicken
And I'm pickin' these strings

I've been down on my luck
Got a heart like a truck
So I ain't giving up
I'm a hummingbird ready to sing

Mmm, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings
Oh, he gives me wings
Mmm, he gives me wings

// Bluebird //

Yeah I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34 was bad
So I just turn to 35
Yeah I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Well I'm a giver
Yeah and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I've made an art
Out of forgetting 'em well
Yeah I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused
And I start to lose
I'll rhyme a dime till it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll turn a light on in my soul
And keep the bluebird in my heart

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

And the bluebird sings

// How Dare You Love //

Sometimes you read it like a school kid writing on chalkboard walls
Sometimes it hits you like the water rollin' over Niagara Falls
Cheeks get flushed like the first time buzz on Cabernet
Boots on the bleachers, the edge of the seaters, just watching you entertain

You show up and put a spell on me
Mmm, the nerve

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

The needle and the ink, don't need to overthink, it's there for good
Leave me you'd never, this is forever, knock on wood
Tender in my chest, the hell with the rest, we're right as rain
Rough around the edges, walkin' all the ledges, going insane

You show up and put your spell on me
Mmm, the nerve

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

You show up and put your spell on me
What's it worth?

How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love
How dare you love

What are we gonna do?
What if we never run away?
We never have to run away

// Fire Escape //

We'll smoke like a couple in the 1960s
Lit up like a pair of Woodstock hippies
Looking down on a town where it don't seem wrong
To be a bonfire blaze where it don't belong

Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame

Downtown bar bands bouncing off the brick walls
Half pint lovers rolling out with their last calls
The street lights down on Lafayette
Ain't seen nothing like you and me yet

Oh, meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame
Baby, we're to blame

We'll smoke like a couple in the 1960s
Up all night like New York City

Oh, meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
Don't let me wait
I wanna start up this flame
Meet me on the fire escape
Meet me on the fire escape
When the building's burning
Baby, we're to blame

// Pretty Bitchin' //

I got a pretty new truck
Had some pretty good luck
And some pretty red wine I'm sippin'
Got a pretty guitar
With a white pickguard
And a pretty good song if you're listenin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

Got a pretty Airstream rollin' down the road
You oughta see the pretty white walls spinnin'
Pretty pink carpet on the floor
No lock on the door
Help yourself to the Tito's in the pretty kitchen
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

I use what I got
I don't let it go to waste
I'm pretty from the back
Kinda pretty in the face
I hate to admit it
But it didn't stop me, did it

Yeah, life's pretty weird, life's pretty great
Life's pretty good if you live it
1, 2, 3 Mississippi
Sitting pretty damn pretty
On this pretty life I've been given
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

Well, I'm a pretty hot mess
But hell, I guess
I'm pretty sure it's a family tradition
I got a pretty good time in the checkout line
With all the free press I've been gettin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

'Cause I use what I got
I don't let it go to waste
I'm pretty from the back
Kinda pretty in the face
I hate to admit it
But it didn't stop me, did it

Yeah, life's pretty weird, life's pretty great
Life's pretty good if you live it
1, 2, 3 Mississippi
Sitting pretty damn pretty
On this pretty life I've been given
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

I've had pretty good day
I'm in a pretty good place
I'd say pretty much I'm winnin'
I gotta pretty good band
Pretty damn good fans
And this pretty good life I'm livin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'
It's pretty bitchin'

// Track Record //

Another date with the devil on Saturday night
Another Bible in my hand on Sunday morning
Last one I left standing in the drive
Said a heart like mine oughta come with a warning
Can't help it, I'm in love with love

I got a track record
A past that's checkered
As the floor at the diner on Main Street
A heart wrecker
A runner under pressure
Like a dang Mustang on high speed
Maybe it's the ones that I can't fix
And maybe it's the chase that makes me tick
Girls like me don't mean it but we don't know better
I got a track record

One might've been a keeper and one was the leaver
And one was the one Daddy gave me away to
One's a user, and one was a loser
Still waiting on the one to give my whole damn heart to
Can't help it, I'm in love with love

I got a track record
A past that's checkered
As the floor at the diner on Main Street
A heart wrecker
A runner under pressure
Like a dang Mustang on high speed
Maybe it's the ones that I can't fix
And maybe it's the chase that makes me tick
Girls like me don't mean it but we don't know better
I got a track record

Maybe it's the ones that I can't fix
Maybe it's ones that make me tick
Girls like me don't mean it but we don't know better
I got a track record
I got a track record
I can't help it, I'm in love with love
I can't help it, I'm in love with love

// Dark Bars //

I'm here for the habit
Complementary matches
The pretty bartenders
The smoke and the mirrors
The unhappy hour
The bitters and sours
Where nobody knows me
Where I can be lonely

I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watching drunks all drown with no lifeguard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard
In a dark bar

I can be reckless
I can be desperate
An invisible stranger
Secrets never in danger
And it ain't nothin' fancy
'Cause the manager, Nancy
She's an old jukebox junkie
She plays nothing but country

I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watching drunks all drown with no life guard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard
Ooh

No, I'm not in pain, I'm not on pills
But I'm still hanging out in dark bars
On a bar stool for the cheap thrills
Watching drunks all drown with no lifeguard
'Cause I know a thing or two about broke hearts
Neon truth can hit real hard
In a dark bar
