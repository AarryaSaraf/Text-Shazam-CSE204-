Album: Kerosene

// Kerosene //

I'm waitin' on the sun to set cause yesterday aint over yet

I started smoking cigarettes there's nothing else to do I guess

Dusty roads aint made for walking, spinning tires aint made for stoppin'

I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad

Life aint hard but it's too long to live it like some country song

Trade the truth in for a lie, cheating really aint a crime

I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


Forget your high society, I'm soakin' it in Kerosene

Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn HA!

Dirty hands aint made for shakin', aint a rule that aint worth breakin'

Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me


Now I don't hate the one who left

You can't hate someone who's dead

He's out there holding on to someone, I'm holding up my smoking gun

I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name

Well I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me

Well I'm giving up on love HEY love's given up on me

// What About Georgia? //

You draw it out like a highway

With every word that you say

Excuses for the answers that you lack

Your mama's still the steady ground you walk on every day

And your daddy's still the monkey on your back

Did you find all you thought you'd find out in the wild, wild west

You took a little piece of home and you threw away the rest


You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge

Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up

Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33

Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun

Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son

She's at home and she's been praying for you

Hey what about Georgia


Saw your sister yesterday

Austin's five and on his way

Looking for some shoes that he can fill

He said that he'd be just like you, the coolest guy he ever knew

And he'd find you when he lost his training wheels

I looked in his big blue eyes and I saw you again

He's hungry for a life that he aint ready to begin


You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge

Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up

Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33

Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun

Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son

She's at home and she's been praying for you

So what about Georgia


Guess you didn't realize it'd take you quite this long

To figure out that being free is right where you belong


You say you're livin' on the edge and I think you're hangin' from a ledge

Too scared to hold the hand that wants to help you up

HEY! Are you the man you thought you'd be by the time that you turned 33

Are you still a bullet in your daddy's gun

Don't forget boy you're your mama's only son

She's at home and she's been praying for you

Hey want about Georgia

What about Georgia yeah

What about Georgia Georgia Yeah

What about Georgia

// Greyhound Bound For Nowhere //

Rain on the window makes me lonely

Time keeps on passing so slowly

The old man sittin' next to me is fallin' asleep

On a Greyhound Bound For Nowhere


The sun's going down on my misery

Another day gone by with broken dreams

That cell phone I hear ringing, I keep wishing it was you

On a Greyhound Bound For Nowhere


That ring that you were wearing don't mean everything

The way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away

She loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share

I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere


Bright lights of a city shining up ahead

My hearts analyzing every word you said

Did you take me for a fool or did you really care

I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere


That ring that you were wearing don't mean everything

The way that you stood starin' as you watched me roll away

She loves you and you need me and there some things we can't share

I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere


I'm gonna find someplace I can ease my mind

And try to heal my wounded pride


Rain on the window and I'm still lonely

And time keeps on passing so slowly

You're with her and I'm alone and you're wishing I was there

I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

We' re all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

// New Strings //

I bet this road will take me out of here

Take me far away from Amarillo

I bet this car will go real fast

The wheels might even drive me past

The places that you said I'd never go

Oh...


The Texas Sky is the biggest one I've seen

But it still aint big enough for you and me

All the things that make you mad,

All the baggage in your past

Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be

So I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams

[Chorus]

An I'll grab the wheel and point it west

Pack the good and leave the rest

I'll drive until I find the missing piece

You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas

And an empty heart

But I have everything I'll ever need

I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings


Mama said I never should have done it

Should have ended us before we ever started

Daddy knew about my pride so he stood there

And he smiled inside and I pretended that I

Didn't notice a little tear that fell when I said I was going

[Repeat Chorus]

[Tag]

I've worried about life and

If it's arriving right on time

I guess if you don't jump

You'll never know if you can fly

[Repeat Chorus]

// I Can't Be Bothered //

I can't be bothered to miss you anymore

Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four

I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure

I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore


It's not like I don't have tears to cry

Such memories so little time

This box of photographs to go through one by one

There's just so much work to get done


I can't be bothered to miss you anymore

Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four

I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure

I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore


When you skipped town I was such a mess

So I found some things to do instead

Trick is to find something to occupy your mind

Now I spend most days chasin' mine


And I can't be bothered to miss you anymore

Month twelve, day thirty-one and hour twenty-four

I used to think if missed hard enough you'd come back for sure

I can't be bothered now to miss you, I'm cuddling up to kiss you

And I can't be bothered now to miss you anymore

// Bring Me Down //

Sweet like a kiss sharp like a razor blade

I find you when I' m close to the bottom

You cant appreciate the time it takes

To kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong

And as I'm putting out the flame

Somebody brings up you name


Oh oh oh oh

Baby baby baby bring me down

I want to be right where you are

Baby baby baby bring me down

You can look me in the eye and break my heart

Break my heart


Six AM unruffled pillow

Laughs out loud at my trusting heart

It's like I didn't see the penny

I missed the fountain by a couple yards

If you would only stay gone

Maybe I could move on


Oh oh oh oh

Baby baby baby bring me down

I want to be right where you are

Baby baby baby bring me down

You can look me in the eye and break my heart

Break my heart


OH! Baby baby baby bring me down

I want to be right where you are

Baby baby baby bring me down

You can look me in the eye and break my heart

Break my heart


OH! Baby baby baby bring me down

I want to be right where you are

Baby baby baby bring me down

You can look me in the eye and break my heart

Break my heart


Bring me down...

// Me And Charlie Talking //

Me and Charlie boy used to go walking, sittin' in the woods behind my house
When being lovers meant a stolen kiss and holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married but we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run dry like so many do these days

So you treat your love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top and run like hell to show it off
Oh, promises were made when we'd go walkin', that's just me and Charlie talking

Charlie always said he'd like to leave here, so he turned eighteen and he left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting for Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
Funny how time and distance change you the road you take don't always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions and then you look up and it's gone

So you treat your love like a firefly like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top and run like hell to show it off
Oh, promises were made when we were walking that's just me and Charlie talking

Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie and how we thought we knew it all back then
Now I'd give anything to feel love from a child's heart again

So you treat your love like a firefly like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar with holes in the top and run like hell to show it off
Oh, promises were made when we were walking that's just me and Charlie talking

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

// I Wanna Die //

You know it's so complicated, first you love then you hate it
Someone's laughing, someone's crying, someone livin', someone's dying
Sombody always looses and we still play the game
And the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die

You always say that you love me and there is no one above me
Never giving, always takin', never bending, always breaking
I know you aint a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin' on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die

Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools

Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing, you're crying, you're livin', I'm dyin'
Somebody always looses and we still play the game
Yeah the fire will always burn you and we still light the flame
Let's make it up baby, cause I aint gonna fight
If you're the death of me darlin', I wanna die

Tear it up, break it down
Put my heart on your sleeve and wear it all over town
I know you're a player but you don't play by the rules
And I'm just another in a long line of fools

Yeah it's so complicated, I love then I hate it
I'm laughing you're crying, I'm living, you're dyin'
I know you aint a liar but you don't tell the truth
And you're walkin on a wire wearing someone else's shoes
If you're handing out misery I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me darlin' I wanna die
OHHHH I wanna die
Tear it up Tear it up
um um um

// Love Is Looking For You //

Maybe you're just jaded from some nobody's unforgotten words
Maybe you're just faded, a little gray from every time that you've been hurt
So you're lookin for your skin that you never did fit in
You can't hide when you're turned inside out
Love is looking for you now

Maybe you been burnin' but you can't blow out a flame that you can't find
Maybe you've been thirsty but the rain just aint enough when you're this dry
So you're runnin' from the water and the fire's getting hotter
I think you better find some level ground
Love is lookin' for you now
Love is lookin' for you now

Maybe you been wearing the shoes that someone else is wearing now
Maybe you've been swearing forever might have already run out
You can't love yourself at the expense of someone else
You can't hide a liar from the truth
Love is lookin' for you
Love is lookin' for you

I've been looking for you
Baby I've been lookin.....
I've been looking for you

// Mama, I'm Alright //

Well the sun just got through going down on a sleepy little Texas town

Population plus one minus one

A new grandma rocks my sister's kid just like twenty years ago she did

The same thing in that same chair

She said "this one's born to run"


Every day at noon like a chapel bell find her Jesus keep her well

Help her do more right than wrong at the end of the day

I got 5 good years and a tank of gas, fifty watts and Johnny Cash

A guitar and a broken heart just full of things to say

You taught me how to stand those tests and trials

But you can't se a desert sunrise in the bible


She loves me more that anything

And she wants the world for me

Her west dropped of in El Paso,

And her north in Abilene

Mama I'm OK out here

I've seen how hard the world can be

My step is sure and I know my name

I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be

I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be


If I'd have done what you and daddy done, would have never lost and never won

Or gotten myself kicked when I was down

I would not know how to travel well, A hundred bucks and cheap motels

I would not know how to fight for my own heart next time around


Now don't you cry another night about me

In this city I've got angels all around me


She loves me more that anything

And she wants the world for me

Her west dropped of in El Paso

And her north in Abilene

Hey Mama I'm OK out here

I've seen how hard the world can be

My step is sure and I know my name

I'm strong just like you prayed Id be

I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be


I felt it every time you prayed for me

I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be

// There's A Wall //

I'd run away but I can't escape the power of your pride

Your eyes are cold like an empty soul and I'm burning up inside

There's nothing wrong with letting go and you're still diggin' in

We're racing to the bottom and I' can't find the end


And there's a wall

Standing here between us

And that's all that's keeping you from freedom

And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger

You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall

And there a wall


You love me when you want to and you find reasons to fight

Another lame excuse to keep the devil on you side

Trying hard to hide those scares that I've already seen

Your beat up heart's not the only thing that's keeping you from me


And there's a wall

Standing here between us

And that's all that's keeping you from freedom

And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger

You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall

And there a wall


Pain has made you weak and hard

I will never be as strong,


As strong...

As this wall

Standing here between us

And that's all that's keeping you from freedom

And I keep pushing harder and you keep getting stronger

You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall

With this wall

// Love Your Memory //

I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight


I can't handle all this pain

All we ever do is fight anyway

Why we even tried I haven't a clue

With hearts involved there's way too much to loose


I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight


You were something else to look at

Your intentions they weren't' all bad

You tried to make me something I wasn't

Lord knows there aint no future in all that


I don't want to see you or feel you

I don't want to look into your eyes

I don't want to touch you or miss you

I just want to love your memory tonight
