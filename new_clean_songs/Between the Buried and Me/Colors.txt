Album: Colors

// Foam Born: (A) The Backtrack //

I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting. In the cold
The supplement
We lost some friends
We drove the bends
So small

A conscious decision to persuade ourselves amongst the common human
The drive to complete ourselves has become a blurry vision
Always wanting more
Bettering ourselves through selfish minds
It has started to overflow
A current that creates this undertow
Swimming beneath it all

// Foam Born: (B) The Decade Of Statues //

I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting
You will just keep waiting
I will just keep waiting
Obsession

Abscess

Rip out my fucking eyes
I can't watch you grow into this
I can't watch the young turn to all of this
Their eyes left wide
Night goggles instead of sleep
Night goggles instead of sleep
Live life...you have all helped me break from this
The few times relaxation steps in bringing me a peaceful place
Live life... you have all helped me break from this
The few times relaxation steps in bringing me a peaceful place

It's a must these days, for the colors are fading
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading

Enclosed in a space of soothing sounds
Walking in my own movie
The fly by with no remembrance
Constant rushing
The waves have pushed me to where I need to be
Walking in my own movie
The fly by with no remembrance
Constant rushing
The waves have pushed me to where I need to be
Sunlight drenched on my skin
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear
Block out the rush hour
Block out the tired herds
Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear
Block out the rush hour
Block out the tired herds
On the shaded side, it's starting to affect the process of your reading eyes
An aggressive need for a hostile voice is creeping away
This block happens every year
And like I said before the color keeps fading

This block happens every year
I couldn't trade this for anything in the world
This block happens every year
And all of you are the reason
This block happens every year
It's been a while since we've written each other and hopefully this will comfort you
'Cause like most of my kind, I won't take it all for granted
I will just keep waiting...you will just keep waiting
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading
It's a must these days, for the colors are fading

Construction paper traffic...corner office destruction
The cityscape burns brighter by the hour
Clock tower: bring us, bring us all, bring us all, bring us all down
Marching like ants to the foundation of a higher form
Trash
Capped and smothered
Trash bag
Trash hat
Wrinkle-free clients of doom

Feed me fear
Informal gluttony

Construction paper lawns...force-fed attention grabber
When will you learn?
First come, first serve
The all you can eat trumpet...playing the tunes of our death
The all you can eat trumpet... playing the tunes of our death
Breathe... now blow

Let it be heard
Let it be heard
The preacher's talent is going through the airwaves
I need to be led in the right direction
The little kids taught me well
But I wonder why they don't listen anymore
It's a television nightmare
Eat and watch, eat, eat, eat... what they feed
Corner office tubes...give me the best view in the hut
Feed me fear

// Sun Of Nothing //

Everywhere I look, they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
Everywhere I look, they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
To a place that makes us feel warm
A place that grants us a smile
Grants us a smile
Seems like a very simple idea, but not hardly figured out

I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this

A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman
A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman

Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call home
The journey begins... forcing a new life with the unexplained
A creeping rush that surrounds me
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away

Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call my home
My own planet... I allowed this wish
Unexpected... not knowing why
Now knowing why
Wonder why I question it now?
I'm my own planet

Not many can experience this sensation
Loneliness is creeping out
Or in, however you think of it
But it sure is surrounding me
Maybe all the complaining is an accurance of boredom
I suppose it's too late

I am floating farther
I am floating farther and farther away
I am floating farther
I am floating
I did love, I did laugh, I did live

A spaceman
They say I am... a spaceman
They say I am
A spaceman
They say I am... a spaceman
They say I am

Planets everywhere... my own destiny
I'm floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
I have become the sun of nothing
Nothing is here
Memories are not clear

I'm floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating, floating, floating to the sun... farther away

I can't believe that's what it has come to
I never really had it all that bad
I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares
Blank stairs

They were looking into something much worse than what I thought I was
Selfishness is a very sticky quality of this species
Looking around... I don't see any faces
Yes, I am lonely
It's to be expected
It's to be expected

I'll sleep

// Ants Of The Sky //

...now
My teeth taste funny today...they seem more jagged than normal
I've been told, I've been told, I've been told that I have been grinding them like gears during my dream hours
I wonder if it's just my thoughts fusing into one frequent dream

One which parts with the night, the night

Saw them dragging the other day, other day
Scraping their knees

Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can't leave myself out
Seems the high horse is taking them all home
I can't leave myself out, self out
Why should we sleep today
Why should we awake tomorrow?

We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight
We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight

Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
This seems to be what I've needed
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek
Across all oceans...a windy, noisy trek
The view used to be better...lands are growing into one

We wanted it this way
We were brought up to grow into one
We were brought up to grow into one

I'm going to fly up soon and seek other lands
The soothing air of flight
A bird's eye view into what I've always imagined life could be
Will it be sought after?
We might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end
Bones of dust need hardening
I think the prescription
I think the prescription is found

Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on... fly on
In your mind, you can fly
Sleep on
Sleep on...fly on
In your mind, you can fly

My teeth grin oddly today
They seem to gleam more than normal
Maybe it will be noticed
Walking dead
Walking dead

// Prequel To The Sequel //

The headless lover of three
An unspeakable affair
The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday, her everyday life
Constant swelling of the ankles
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help
A pleasant cry for help
She began to unfold her story
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder
A perfect crime, that soon lived on
A different life it had to develop
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas, it grew onto its own
A much needed surrender
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed a lifeless neck
From a monster to a beauty in quick months
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom
It decided it should take advantage, advantage of this idea, of this idea
A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body
A spectacle none-the-less
Walking proud through life, letting its branches guide the way
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine
It must be human, for its qualities seem to outdo even the grandest occupant of the town

This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life
This started to catch the attention of the un-branched
It had never experienced an affection of this kind
A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life

Years went by as it finally found true love
The love of others...three to be exact
Letting them into every secret...feeding from every branch
Every part used for their lives

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal
The breeze didn't flow like it used to
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower
What caused this?
What caused this?
It soon was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem

Torn to its last life
How hadn't it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings
It didn't think anything could go this wrong
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."

"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."

It thought life was constant
Happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out
It thought life was constant
Happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out

"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."
"Comfort."

Hints and all, they did as they pleased
And now it's starting to wilt away

// White Walls //

The monsters are made, and we have proven that we will be one of them
The whores take the stage
The whores take the stage...flash our skills
Gotta draw 'em in... gotta keep 'em on their toes, on their toes
Don't show them how you truly are... who would want honesty
Who would want a group of people that one can relate with?
Don't show them how you truly are... who would want honesty
Who would want a group of people that one can relate with?

They have to look up... simple peasants
Who the fuck thinks we can all be on a similar plane

We need worship
We need worship

We need devotion
Becoming gods from the image that is thrown
Thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort
We need devotion
Becoming gods from the image that is thrown
Thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort

It's not a musical journey anymore
They chose Camilla and we stood by her the entire time
Monotonous expression...a forced replica of a tired sound
Puppets for a greed-driven carnival
The same charade as the passing years
Force me out there
Don't give them a chance
Don't give them a chance

They want to be fed...fed a simple replication of past greatness

We just need to throw some new ideas in
It will eventually get out of this closed off circle we are part of
Get out of this closed off circle
Get out of this closed off circle
It's all the same

This is all we have when we die
It's what's left of us when we die
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this
We will be remembered for this

The same
