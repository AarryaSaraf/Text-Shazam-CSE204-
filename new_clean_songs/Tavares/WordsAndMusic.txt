// Deeper In Love //

Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love

When it comes to love, I got to be for real
(I never hesitate to show just how I feel)
Once too often, my heart's been filled with pain
(And it seems I'll never learn to play the game)

Girl, in my deepest thoughts
How I wonder if your heart is true
There is a chance it's not
Still I just can't help thinking of you
And I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love

At times, I ask myself just what I'm lookin' for
(Girl, I find it all in you and so much more)
There can be no doubt that you're the one I need
(Open eyes will see the signs are there to read)

I've got to find a way
To break through this dark cloud of indecision
My heart says play it safe
But I'd rather find out what I'm missing
So I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love
Sinkin' deeper no matter what I do
Keep falling deeper in love
I won't let love slip through my hands again
Keep falling deeper in love
This time, I'm holdin' on to love, whoo

I'm falling deeper
Falling deeper

I was so lost in pride
So afraid one day I'd have to face rejection
But now I realize
That it hurts more to lock love inside
And I

Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love with you
Keep falling deeper in love
No matter what I do, I said, I
Keep falling deeper in love
Love's really got me hooked this time
Keep falling deeper in love
I'm falling deeper in love
I said, I
Keep falling deeper in love
Deeper in love, deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love
I won't let love slip through my hands again
Keep falling deeper in love
Ooh
Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love
Keep falling deeper in love

// Words And Music //

My darlin'
You know that I depend upon your very smile
And my day would not begin
Without your precious kiss
And if someone wrote my story
And tried to leave you out, huh
The most important part they'd surely miss

(Do you understand) I'm nothing without you
Girl, you're my heart, you're my soul
You're my life, it's true

You are the words
You are the music
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words
You are the music
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

No, I can't count the ways
You've brought me happiness
You've shown me what no other love has shown

(And, oh) If I live forever
If I live a million years
This heart will still want you and you alone

(Never, ever doubt) You are the only one
Girl, you're my world, you're my dreams
You're my morning sun

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

(Yes, it's true)
I'll dedicate each passing day to you
Now and forever more
Your love is what I'm living for
(Don't you understand) I'm holding out
I'm holding out my hand to you

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

You are the words (You are the words)
Girl, you're my music [Girl, you are my music] (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
Girl, you are my music [Girl, you are my music] (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed
