// Whodunit //

Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me (Yeah)
Whodunit
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
It's a bedside mystery (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, where's the phone to call Sherlock Holmes
(Somebody took my baby)
I've been framed by what's his name
And he's gettin' away Charlie Chan, see if you can
Help me find those two, won't you
Where were you on the night of the 12th
(I was by myself)
She went dancin' in the dark,
Somebody stole her heart Ellery Queen if you're so keen
Won't you help me find my sweet thing (Yeah, yeah)

Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me (Yeah)
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
It's a bedside mystery

The place is surrounded
(The place is surrounded)
Nobody leaves till I found her
(Nobody leaves till I found her)
Until this case is solved
It's up against the wall, you all

Whodunit
(I wonder, wonder who)
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
Everyone in the room looks shady

Who stole my girl from me
(Hey Baretta, won't you please go get her)
Whodunit
(For cryin' out loud)
Who took my honey
Whodunit
(Somebody call McCloud)
I know the motive was not funny

(Tell Dirty Harry)
Everyone in the room looks shady

// Goodnight My Love (Pleasant Dreams) //

Goodnight My Love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go, please be honest
(Please remember)
I need you
And this love that I have for you
Will never grow cold
If you should wake, in the still of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I care
Please give your love to me dear, only
Goodnight My Love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go, please remember
I need you so
And this love that I have for you
Will never grow cold
Goodnight...
... Pleasant dreams
