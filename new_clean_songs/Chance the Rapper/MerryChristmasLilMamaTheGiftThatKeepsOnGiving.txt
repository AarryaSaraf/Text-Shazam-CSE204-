// Snowed In //

I'll be home for Christmas
Whether everybody say
I'll be right there on my sleigh for you
I'll be home for Christmas
Fuck 'bout what they have to say
Pull up on you in the sleigh
Know you got them gifts for me, yeah, yeah
Hope you do them tricks for me, yeah, yeah
Know you on my list, shawty, yeah, yeah
Roll up somethin' lit for me, yeah, yeah
Baby, every Christmas Eve
Won't be right, you next to me
Tell me you gon' ride on my sleigh
Whatever you wanna see
Can I be all that you need
Every year on Christmas Eve?

Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

Where you at? Come slide
I could really use a ride
When the Uber has arrived
I won't even come inside
I just wanna catch a ride
Roll a wood, catch a vibe
We could have a silent night
Long as I'm up by your side

You won't need them boots or the furs
Give it to you proper, yes sir
Stay the night, baby, here's a shirt
(I just need you next to me)
Let's get close and blame it all on the weather
Girl, you know you deserve so much better
Let's make a snowman and ball together
(Every year on Christmas Eve)

Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is
Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is

Girl, you saying that's facts
Tell me how you like my Santa hat
Good times, that's how we take it back
With the Al Green up in a bag
I make her scream, I'm Mr. Felcher
Yeah, while she cooking Hamburger Helper
She on the pole, she Santa's helper

It ain't nothing no one can tell her
Hey lil' mama in the pink
You would look good in a mink
They all say the same thing
All my exes say jinx
What you want? Tryna link
Who all you tryin' to bring?
They ain't even gotta change
Let her jingle in her jeans

Now we ain't got to hit the club
Know you cold, let's bundle up
I'm just tryna get some love
I hope it wasn't obvious
It's a white Christmas at the crib
Tryna get snowed in
Unwrap you while we lay
Go and show me what it is (Girl, you slay)
Now we ain't got to hit the club (I love her)
Know you cold, let's bundle up (Baby, you slay)
I'm just tryna get some love (I love her)
I hope it wasn't obvious (Girl, you slay)
It's a white Christmas at the crib (I love her)
Tryna get snowed in (Baby, you slay)
Unwrap you while we lay (I love her)
Go and show me what it is

Girl, you slay, I love her
Baby, you slay, I love her
Girl, you slay, I love her
Baby, you slay, I love her

// Joy //

Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (When Jesus, was a little boy)
(He was a little boy, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love
(Forget all about love, forget all about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Get right back to joy, get right back to joy, get right back to joy)

Baby, let's light up the Christmas tree
Spike the eggnog with the Hennessy
Spread the love that heat the coldest winter
Jingle Bells is all I could remember
'Tis the season we should spread the cheer
Christmas caroling, door-to-door
Can't forget just what we do this for
When can we can get back to the joy?

Got some hot chocolate for you, baby
Silent nights, just hit me up
Can't tell me that you not my angel
We should make snow angel doves
Outside, lookin' Christmas and you just who I'm thinkin' of
Favorite time of year, why can't you feel the love?

Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (When Jesus was a little boy)
(He was a little boy, he was, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love
(Forget all about love, forget all about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Let's get, get right back to joy)
(Bundle of joy)

Why y'all always arguing and carrying on?
Christmas was meant for sharing a bond
Google "Chicago Bettie Jones", them kids buried their mom
Sometimes I dream of moving a spot where cops carry batons
So I could visit with jet lag, lose all my checked bags
To wake up in my old room with beauties from Jet Mag
I hate when y'all talk about bail money
Who go to jail for me and who tryna steal from me?
I got that Sister Carolyn Jenkins KOK covenant love
I'm covered at the door, the cover's the blood
Bungalow Jungle that housed a thousand fistfights that humble my buds
Couple birds that make me wonder what was
Won't let the lawyers destroy us
The Pontius Pilates judge my bundle of joys
I know my bronze is gorgeous
Know who the birthday boy is
I'm on my 773 love
Weaponized free love, 7979 (7777)

Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy, joy, joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy (Little baby boy)
(He was a little boy, was a little boy, he was)
They tend to forget about love (They tend to forget all about love, forget all about love, love, love)
Let's get right back to joy (Joy, joy)
(Get right back to joy, get right back to joy)
Joy

Drinks to the sky, we gettin' fucked up
'Tis ain't the season without the one you love

If I'm your Santa

Slide down your chimney, babe

Salt on the streets, Timbs on my feet

Fam all around, tryna run the town
Love how it smells, pray is all we do
Bucket full of wings

Winter break, no school zone

[Chance The Rapper:]
Jeremih on the beat, lighting up a tree
Seven nominee, I cannot believe
Pray for '79th, pray for '79th
Ford City all the way to over East
I've been going in, snow inside my Timbs
Frozen all my limbs, big salt truck
Now I'm flying in, where you wanna land?
Million pair again, big boss bucks, baby
Finna hit the plaza
Cop a couple plasmas
You don't want no asthma
Mild sauce, my wings
Nights at the rink
These are a few of my favorite things

[Jeremih:]

Wake up early, I just wanna open presents with you, baby
(Uh-uh)
Kensli, Kensli (Igh)

[Jeremih:]
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy that can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing, babe, run a couple blocks with me
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list (Everything that I want)
Copped a new toy that can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing, babe, run a couple blocks with me

Can't wait 'til I get home, yeah, 'tis the season
Greens and them ham hocks
Yeah, where's the seasoning
Hope that auntie come wrap Santa's gifts, yeah
Hope that none her fam' wasn't 'round to see that
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
They snuck in and out the halls
On my wrist, my neck, deck the halls
If I ain't say nun', no one else does

Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy that can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing, babe, run a couple blocks with me

[Chicago Childrens Choir:]
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy that can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing, babe, run a couple blocks with me

[Chance The Rapper:]
Growing up we had it hard
Santa rarely at the door
Daddy worked to keep us warm
But you know we just wanted more
But look at how far we ran, look what I am
Daddy used to work that Streets and San'
Put a black man in the White House, damn
Name me one teacher that was right about Chance
Right about Kim or right about Cam
Right about Jan, I write down plans
Put it on the drawing boards like y'all kids
And get it done if not right now when?
We was broke now, we not now
Santa loud when he knock now
Getting bands like The Rock now
Shaking hands with Barack now
Smoking 'Woods like a chimney
Green faces all Grinchy
Tryna give her that Disney
Merry Christmas lil' Kensli

[Jeremih & Chicago Childrens Choir:]
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list (Everything that I want)
Copped a new toy that can't fit under the Christmas tree

Black folk at the show, black car at the store
Black love ya if you love me, black heart if you don't

// Family For //

[Francis & The Lights:]
Wanna cry, wanna laugh
Wanna give all I have
I'm so grateful
I can fight through the pain
'Cause I fight in your name
You're my shelter
I'm so grateful for you

[Chance the Rapper:]
For my house, for my home
For my chair, for your throne
For your love, for your mercy and grace
For a job or a dub or a odd or a slug
Or a bone or whatever you say
Hop in the whip and turn the heat up
Turn that seat hotter than a teacup
Please tell the car to turn the beat up
Evergreen Plaza, had the black Santa
Coconuts across the street, get my CDs up
Shout out Meechy, Peanut, LaTiara
Used to buy my snow cones, pay ya back tomorrow
Every time I go home, hear a bunch of sorrows
Grass is always muddy at the other party
Drive down to Blue Island for that flavor
Where they ain't scared to say the name of the Savior
Oh, we got some healing, got some blessings, got some favors
We got some gifts, we on the list for good behavior

[Jeremih:]
Give you whatever you want
Ain't that what the family for?
All I know, all I want
Be around the family more
Be there whenever you want
You know what the family for
All I want, all I want
Be around the family more

[Chance the Rapper:]
My cousins not soft, one skippin' frosh-soph
One finally grew up, cut the block off and cut his locks off
One of 'em passing all her classes, now pass the hot sauce
Never become one of those knockoffs that rather not talk
I know I look just look my auntie, (Love my auntie)
I'ma keep it funky, talk too much like Donkey
On my back like monkey (Love my auntie)
On my line like laundry, she keep it a hundred
I'm the biggest brother, biggest cousin, big ol' nigga, big folks
Just hit my jack like Peter Pan, that shit don't never get old
They introduce some evidence, my homie might never get home
That's why we screamin', "Fuck the president" like Marilyn Monroe

[Jeremih:]
Give you whatever you want
Ain't that what the family for?
All I know, all I want
Be around the family more
Be there whenever you want
You know what the family for
All I want, all I want
Be around the family more

Wanna cry, wanna laugh
Wanna give all I have
I'm so grateful (Grateful, grateful)
I can fight through the pain
'Cause I fight in your name
You're my shelter (Grateful)
I'm so grateful for you (Grateful)

// One More Cry //

[Jeremih:]
I've been looking for somethin' I'm gon' find
What should I do in the meantime?
Say you can't look for it, it'll find you
Do you feel the same too?
Something that I ain't said in a long time (Yeah, yeah)
Front line, I was fighting for you
Angels sing in the choir for you
If you want it
Favorite poem, I wrote it for you
Know you know it
Turned it into a song for you

Days go by, I try
To bottle these tears inside
Here's one more cry, I cry

[Chance the Rapper:]
Single-handedly, I been taking real good care of me
That shit in my blood like liquor or Cherokee
You know black folk, we don't go to no therapy
Tell 'em keep they two cents, give it to charity
Go H.A.M. like Sara Lee
Watch it all go down the drain like merrily, merrily
Legally blind to my friends, I see 'em barely, barely
They say, "Let me holla at you," guess that's why they call 'em holidays
But Christmas feel like Simba on a Father's Day
I'm supposed to be the strongest, the oldest
The leader of our country-ass family
The POTUS, the podium come up to my shoulders
I'm short and I'm shook and I'm broken
My favorite voters can't show up to the polls
And you still don't want me to show emotion and I refuse
'Cause I love you, that's why, 'cause I want to, that's why
'Cause I miss you, that's why, 'cause I miss you, that's why
Know I said that was the last one last year
But we both know you deserve one last tear

[Jeremih:]
Days go by, I try
To bottle these tears inside
There's one more cry, I cry

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah

[Chance The Rapper:]
Every time I feel the grace, it feel like God just said "Hello there"
Never been to Heaven but I know I wanna go there
Carry me through cancer when my auntie didn't have no hair
Shook me when she left us but my faith did not go nowhere
I've been banging on my chest when I cry, flex when I cry
Beat a nigga's ass when I cry, dance when I cry
Feel like I'm the man when I cry, I won't let it go
Don't hold it against me
My Auntie Kim told me punch you in your motherfucking mouth if you lie on me
Can't no pussy ass nigga ever never get down on me
079, they count on me
Tears raining down on me, to the ground on me
Me and God playing tips 'cause he never gonna bounce on me, won't bounce on me
Tryna find a button-up shirt for your funeral
Tryna find a bunch of answers only you would know
I'm just tryna play my part like a movie role
Need a bitch face-down like it's Yu-Gi-Oh!
I ain't tryna act hard, life's hard enough
God knows my heart when the cards is tucked
So I ain't never been scared of no groupie ho
Though I walk through the valley like Coolio
I've been up for days, I ain't cry for years, bitch, I'm fucking serious
Let 'em dress where I get my dress, are you okay, sis?
Yeah, I'm lit, had to let 'em live, had to let 'em live
See you at the crib, see you at the crib

[Jeremih:]
Favorite poem, I wrote it for you
Know you know it
Turn it into a song for you

// Are U Live //

ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

Oh, you live (Yup), lit (Yup), loud (Yup)
Dirty (Yup), clothes (Yup), hamper (Hey), tramp (Yup), study (Hey)

Handshake, what's that? Dap (Dap)

Fuck with my 12s, Wisconsin Dells

Fucked that bitch and send her right back to you
Chunk up the deuce
Been pulled the trigger, I've been that nigga
Yeah
Ooh, I'm with my lil' man, I'm with the zoo
With the wood in my ear, made the roof disappear (Woo)
Fucked that bitch to Erykah Badu, haha, yeah
Used to rock Havana Joe boots
I'm sorta bougie, but I'm not a bitch
You got the goose, but it's not a Givenchy
I swear, my palms, they be itching
You rocking braids, that shit is different
Do Versace, look through the shades
She lucked out with me, call us up in the kitchen
I mix the lean with apple juice
She off a bean, she wanna juke
She don't want water, she don't want food
Still no chaser? (Ooh)
Mexican booth, I bought some fruit
Elephant tooth
Look what I bought, regular suit
Grammys, I'm smoking that Pepé Le Pew

Oh, you live (Yup), lit (Yup), loud (Yup)
Dirty (Yup), clothes (Yup), hamper (Hey), tramp (Yup), study (Hey)

Handshake, what's that? Dap (Dap)

At Mariano's, I got the pooch
I got the loot, eatin' good, yeah
At Mariano's, I got my pooch
I got the puppy, I got the pump
Thanks to the mailman, I got the dump
I hit a lick, didn't touch a tongue
I got blue huns, separate the ones
Take it to Chase, facin' a blunt
Fogo De Chao, that was for lunch
I'm tryna dunk, skip to my lou
Check in my bed, checkin' my suit
Fuck that bitch twice, that's deja vu
Fuck on a journalist, she want the scoop
Now she do the news
Black diamonds, I'm on the slopes
My baby need a new coat
I'ma slide to River Oaks
Auntie Annie's when I walk through the door
Magic picture, man, I'm chargin' for photos
I need me some bread, I need me some bread
Niggas salty, man, that's all they gon' throw
I need me some prez, preferably dead
Remember the block is hot
My Pioneer shake the block
Oh, a little bit off the top
Please Calvin, don't sell the shop
Ice cubes in my eggnog
Ms. Claus in them red drawers
Shit, who do you think you are?
Bitch, you giving a TedTalk?

Oh, you live (Yup), lit (Yup), loud (Yup)
Dirty (Yup), clothes (Yup), hamper (Hey), tramp (Yup), study (Hey)

// Stranger At The Table (Piano Remix) //

[Jeremih:]
No, you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl, who you want around?
I know I'm not that nigga that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where was you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, I'ma tell you that
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

[Chance The Rapper and Jeremih:]
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

[Jeremih:]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

[Chance The Rapper:]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone
We should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Aunty Cam and all of them
And they act like Maury
They say, "Where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like Lena Horne in "The Wiz"
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some "Don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me

I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
Yeah, yeah
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

[Jeremih:]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

My Xmas at home
My Xmas at home
My Xmas at home
My Xmas at home

// The Return //

Yo, it's the return of the gifted gifter
The secret Santa grab bag sifter
The Grinch sled hanging off the ledge
Dead lifter
The best thrifter
The tear jerker
The Santa's little helper
Employee of the year worker
The smile bringer
The joy inside the child lingers
The boy inside the crowd proud he's a loud singer
The whole choir
The bowtier
The snow plow and the snow tires
The coat buyer
The "Aw you shouldn't have"-er
The Birkin Bagger
The gifted rapper
They told me it's the thought that counts but really it's the count that matters
Accountant hacker
Bank amount countin backwards
A thousand smackers
Its the return of Chris Kringle that piss singles
That shit tingles
Sending checks twice cause the names on the list wrinkled
My chips Pringle
My chips bingo
My green mean go
Your green means slow
It's the young born again
Good hood ornament
With a little chicken like a Cornish hen
Amazon ordering
Cohiba importer
Evergreen watering
Wrapping all night will he ever bring the chorus in
Fireplace bright like I threw ten menorahs and
Ten more kinaras and a whole fucking forest in
I'll buy the doll and the mall that the store is in
I'll hide the presents and the dresser and the drawer is in
My dog doin' moves, he said "this shit is on the floor again"
Feds was on his trail but he got 50 names in Oregon
I bought cases bigger than the suits that you see Lori in
James still sitting but I'm sending a DeLorean
Look it's Mr. Christmas Bonus
Mr. Made his brothers bands, Mr. Nicholas Jonas
Mr. big cahones
But bigger heart that's where the homeless' home is
The home alone kid
It's the return of Kevin McCallister
The Swiss Mister
The hot chocolate mixer
That gets pictures
The big, big cousin misser
The quick fixer
The Wiz Oz big blizzard
The big gifter

// All the Way //

[Jeremih:]
Wait, kringle bells all the way
Ayy, on your heels, girl, make that shake (Shake, shake, shake)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh
And tryna tee up Christmas day
Won't you, won't you kringle bells all the way
Ayy, got them bells all on her shake (Shake, shake, shake, shake)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on the way
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes in my sleigh, ayy

Hello, kitty (Hell yeah)

It's cuffing season (Hell yeah)
But you got a man (Yeah, yeah)
Tell him get (Spread up)
I'm in the spirit (Yeah, yeah)
So who's is it? (Say it now)

[Chance The Rapper (Jeremih):]
I don't play (Legs up)
See my face (Hell yeah)
Have a seat (Oh yeah)
Make a plate (Hell yeah)
She can't wait (Yeah, yeah)
Still awake (Spread up)
To open gifts (Yeah, yeah)
It's Christmas Day (Say it now)

[Jeremih (Chance The Rapper):]
Ayy, kringle bells all the way (All the way)
Ayy, on your heels, girl, make that shake (I make it shake)
Got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh (Up on my sleigh)
And tryna tee up Christmas day (On Christmas day)

Ayy, got them bells all on her shake (On Christmas day)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on the way (I brought them away)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes in my sleigh

[Jeremih:]
I'll keep you close
Howlin' in snow
Call your Santa Claus
That's what Christmas for

[Jeremih (Chance The Rapper):]
Hey, I got jingle all the way (All the way)
Ayy, got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh (I make it sleigh)
And tryna tee up Christmas Day, yeah (On Christmas Day)
And tryna tee up Christmas Day (On Christmas Day)
Tell them jingle bells all the way (Up all the way)
Ayy, bells are hangin', oh damn, they shake (I make it shake)
I got three hoes on the way (Up on the way)
And tryna tee up Christmas day (On Christmas Day)

[Jeremih:]
Just tell me, which floor should I get off?
And I'll be right there to set it off
I'll be right there to deck the halls
Either your love or none at all
And your presence is a present for me
For Christmas or just because
It's either your love or none at all
Either your love or none at all

[Hannibal Buress:]
Christmas
Oh, I love Christmas
Being obligated to buy shit for people at a certain time of the year
I buy Christmas gifts, but just, just 'cause you're supposed to
Jesus
Auto-Tune that for me
Jesus
Consumerism
Jesus' birthday
I swear to God, if you leave my raw vocals like that
We not friends anymore
Auto-Tune my shit and put them
Put them Travis Scott effects on my shit

// Stranger at the Table //

Bongo by the way

No, you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl, who you want around?

// Who's To Say //

Love is a casualty of war
My little cousin thought that I ain't love him anymore
Nothing could be farther from the truth
Here, take this liquor and this Swisher as the truce
I was just made 'cause you stole
I was mad, but it's old
We gon' talk about it face to face
Forgiveness is the answer and auntie's is the place
Sunday, we going to the house
Someone got a problem, they gon' have to kick us out
But if you come, I hope you decide to stay
Just know your big cousin love ya either way

'Cause who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
I love you still, still
I love
People that they said to never trust
Even if we never stayed in touch
I love you

Love is forgiveness at its core
My cousin think her grandma doesn't love her anymore
Nothing could be farther from the truth
Take the pictures of your daughter on her wall as the proof
I think she was just mad nobody told her
She thought that you was too young
But your daughter getting older
I think y'all should talk about it face to face
Forgiveness is the topic and her house is still the place
Sunday, we back up at the house
Someone got a issue, they gon' have to drag us out
I know they probably feel some type of way, ah
Someone always got something to say

But who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
She loves you still, still
She luh... loves you
People that we knew was quick to judge
People that would always do too much
We love you still, still

Love is not the sanitized, romanticized soliloquy
That smiles and tries to reconcile without accountability
'Cause justice is the motive, and that's the thing that's missing
That's the sickness of the culture, the system that was keeping us
From loving how we supposed to, the secrets that we keep
That keep us comfortable and closer, the silence and the church
When it was violence they would know of, it made us feel like Christ
He didn't like us, didn't know us, but this is the biggest lie
The enemy done ever told us, I know he was the shoulder
I could hold on like a toga when others did me vulgar
I'm just looking for closure, I know that love is righteous
Love is what is happening when someone apologizes
Love is the day that the Grinch's heart grew three sizes
Love is priceless, love is passion, God is love
And all you got is good and God is having
God still love ya, don't believe me? Ask Him

But who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
He loves you still, you still, He loves
You still, He loves, you still, you still, you still
He loves
People that may think they not enough (you still)
People that may think they are in luck (He love you still)
He loves, loves you (He love you still, you still)

Merry Christmas

// Let Me Bang //

Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Bang it

I like a freaky bitch that don't talk when she pillow talk
I just wanna bang, that's enough
Know she got a nigga but that ain't my nigga
And she got her ass, but damn, her body thicker
Tryna bang, what's your name?
Tryna drank, what you drank?
I got some plans to break your back and break the bank

I'm tryna (Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, let me bang)
Come here (Let me bang)
Come here (Let me bang)
(Let me bang)
(Bang it)

I need a ride or die to spell her name on top of me
When she need a break she just start toppin' me
I'm like, "Hol' on, baby, let me put in work"
But she don't want no work, she start to pull my shirt
She let me bang (She let me bang)
Shake the frame (Shake the frame)
If you can hang (If you can hang)
I'll make it rain (I'll make it rain)
She throw it back, she make it clap, she not no lame (Not no lame)
She let me bang (Hit it from the back)
She let me bang (Hit it from the back), she let me bang (Let me bang)

Let me bang
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
