// Fat Bottomed Girls //

Oh you gonna take me home tonight
Oh down beside that red firelight
Oh you gonna let it all hang out
Fat-bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go 'round

Hey, I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery (huh)
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

Hey, hey!

I've been singing with my band
'Cross the water, 'cross the land
I've seen every blue-eyed floozy on the way (hey)
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time

C'mon!

Oh, won't you take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside your red firelight
Oh, and you give it all you got
Fat-bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go 'round
Fat-bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go 'round

Hey, listen here
Now I got mortgages and homes
I got stiffness in the bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you done made a big man of me (now get this)

Oh (I know), you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh, down beside that red firelight
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out
Fat-bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go 'round (yeah)
Fat-bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go 'round

Get on your bikes and ride

Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, them fat-bottomed girls
Fat-bottomed girls, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Ride 'em come on
Fat-bottomed girls
Yes, yes, right

// Jealousy //

Oh, how wrong can you be?
Oh, to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?

Oh, jealousy, look at me now
Jealousy, you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy, you led me on

You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Oh, how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears

If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh, jealousy, you tripped me up
Jealousy, you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain

Jealousy, when will you let go?
Got a hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left
With my own jealousy

// If You Can't Beat Them //

Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide even if it hurts you inside
So I said, "Give as good as you get."

If you can't beat them join them
You'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

Come on go get up, hey
Sure feels good

Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine and dine me
Trying to wind me 'round and around
And bind me to your legal contract. Ha! Ha!
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that, that yeah
I'll play you at your own game
Yeah

If you can't beat them join them
You'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

That's good
Play it again

If you can't beat them join them
Oh, you'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
It's everyone for themselves

Move on out!
Hey!

Oh, I like it!
Rock 'n' roll ready! Yeah
Woo-hoo!

// Let Me Entertain You //

Hey, it's a sellout!

We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force of course

// Dead On Time //

Oh, yeah

Fool, always jumpin'
Never happy where you land, hey
Fool, got no business
Take your livin' where you can, hey
Hurry down the highway
Hurry down the road
Hurry past the people staring
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

(Leave on time! Leave on time!)
Never got your ticket
But you leave on time
(Leave on time! Leave on time!)
Gonna get your ticket
But you leave on time
(Leave on time! Leave on time!)
Put it in your pocket
But you never can tell

Leave on time, leave on time
Shake that rattle
Gotta leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Fight your battle
But you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
You never got a minute
No, you never got a minute
No you never, never got
Oh, no matter

Fool, got no business
Hangin' 'round and tellin' lies
Fool, you got no reason
But you got no compromise, hey
Stampin' on the ceilin'
Hammerin' on the walls
Gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get, oh
You know I'm going crazy

(Leave on time! Leave on time!)
Got to get ahead
But you leave on time
(Leave on time! Leave on time!)
Gotta head on ahead

You're running in the red
But you never can tell

Hey-hey
Oh, oh

Ooh, honey, honey

Where's my money?
Where's my money?
I wanna get paid, I wanna get paid
Gotta leave, gotta leave
Gotta leave ya, oh!

Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta get rich
Gonna leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
But you can't take it with you
When you leave on time
Leave on time, leave on time
Gotta keep yourself alive
But you leave on time
But you leave on time
Leave on time, dead on time

You're dead!

// In Only Seven Days //

Monday
Start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away
Ooh, ooh

Tuesday
Saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade

I wish Friday
Would last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday
Just twenty-four hours
Oh no, I'm going back
Home on Sunday

I'm so sad alone

// Dreamer's Ball //

Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

Oh, take me, take me, take me
To the dreamer's ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
'Til it's morning
It's all been true

What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me to that dreamers' ball?
I'd like that
Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown, dreamers' ball

Oh, take me, take me, take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball

// Fun It //

Everybody in the morning
Should do a good turn all right
Everybody in the night time
Should have a good time all night
Now we got a movement
Don't shun it, fun it

Can't you see? Now you're moving free
Get some fun, join our dynasty
Can't you tell? When we get it down
You're the one, you're the best in town

Hey, everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

They say that moving
The body's jive it's all right
That's the only one part
Of being alive, all right, all right

Groove on out, groove on up, OK
Do your thing, do your thing your way
Get your kicks, get your tricks with me
Get up and dance, honey, fun's for free

Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Time tonight, time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it

// Leaving Home Ain't Easy //

I take a step outside and I breathe the air
And I slam the door and I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man, don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way
Back home (no way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

Leaving home ain't easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, there's a million things
A-calling me back
Leaving home ain't easy
On the one you're leaving home

Stay my love
My love, please stay
Don't stray, my love
What's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?

Leaving home ain't easy
My God, how could I think of leaving?
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessarily
The only way

Leaving home ain't easy
But may be the only way

// Don't Stop Me Now //

Tonight
I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out
Yeah!
I'm floating around
In ecstasy

So don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky
Yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call

Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah!

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh explode

I'm burning through the sky
Yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey!

Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I like it

Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Have a good time, good time

Don't stop me
Don't stop me

Ooh, let loose, honey, alright

Oh, I'm burning through the sky
Yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (Hey)
Traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you (Hey, hey)

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Alright
Just give me a call

Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time (Hey, hey)
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

Ah, da, da, da, da
Da, da, ah, ah
Ah, da, da, ah, ah, ah
Ah, da, da
Ah, da, da, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

// More Of That Jazz //

If you're feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinking how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given a thousand times before

It's just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Only football gives us thrills
Rock 'n' roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lie on the floor
Kinda think I've heard that line before

Just more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more no more of that jazz

Oh no matter fool
Get no business hanging around and telling lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can't beat them join them
Fun it
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out
Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go 'round

No more
No more
No more
Of that jazz
