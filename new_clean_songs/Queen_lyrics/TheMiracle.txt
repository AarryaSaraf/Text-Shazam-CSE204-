Album: TheMiracle

// Party //

We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
The party was over, uh uh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know
I know we got what it takes
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa!
Why don't you come back and play?

Come back and play (hey hey)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play
Play, play it, play it
Go get 'em boy, let's party
Yeah

Give it give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over

Hey, come back and play
(Come back and play)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come
Back and play (and play)
Come back and play
We got all night we got all day
We got all night and day
Come back, come back, come back
Come back, back and play!

Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
The party is over

// Khashoggi's Ship //

Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh
I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life are like a super nova
Huh, huh, perpetual craze
I said that

Everybody drank my wine you get my drift
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship
Well, we really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip

This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me
I said uh, uh, babe

Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased, we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse

Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup
Bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Ooh
Wooh wooh wooh
Wooh wooh wooh, hah!

This one's on me so let us
Do it just right
This here one party
Don't get started 'til midnight
Yeah

Hey! Hah!
Everybody's party to the left
Party to the right
Lay mine in the middle
Do it all night, alright alright, hey
Two within the middle with you
We're going buddy
Hey uh, hey huh
Alright, hey
Left, right, left, right
No one stops my, ah!

// The Miracle //

Every drop of rain that falls
In Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle

We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth, an end to war
It's a miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today

If every leaf on every tree
Could tell a story that would be
A miracle
If every child on every street
Had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free
To live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle

We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
(The wonders of this world go on)
Open hearts and surgery
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

(The wonders of this world go on)
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on earth (peace on earth)
And an end to war (an end to war)
It's a miracle we need - the miracle
The miracle, peace on earth
And end to war, today

That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come

// I Want It All //

I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out

"It ain't much I'm asking"
I heard him say
"Got to find me a future
Move out of my way"

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
For the dreams of youth

I want it all, I want it all
(Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all
(Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime
(People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all
(And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I want it all)

It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now
(Ooh, ooh) I want it now

I want it, I want it!
Ooh, huh!

// The Invisible Man //

[Roger Taylor (Freddie Mercury):]
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
(Incredible how you can)
(See right through me)

[Roger Taylor:]
Freddie Mercury!

[Freddie Mercury:]
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel something move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

[Roger Taylor (Freddie Mercury):]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(Incredible how you can)
(See right through me)
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(It's criminal how I can)
(See right through you)

[Freddie Mercury:]
John Deacon!

Now I'm in your room and I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life and I'm in your head
Like the CIA or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

[Roger Taylor (Freddie Mercury):]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(Incredible how you can)
(See right through me)
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(It's criminal how I can)
(See right through you)

[Freddie Mercury:]
Hah, hah, hah, hello (Professor)
Hah, hah, hah, OK (Professor)
Hah, hah, hah, hello, hello, hello, hello
Never had a real good friend
Not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through
Let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Brian May, Brian May!

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me, dear

[Roger Taylor (Freddie Mercury):]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(Incredible how you can)
(See right through me )
Watch me!
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
(It's criminal how I can)
(See right through you)

Look at me, look at me
(Roger Taylor!)

[Freddie Mercury:]
Shake you, shake you, shake you, dear

// Breakthru //

When love breaks up, (Breaks up)
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make
This final breakthrough, now!

I wake up, feel just fine
Your face fills my mind
I get religion quick
Because you're looking divine
Honey, you're touching something
You're touching me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell
Can't you see?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh yeah

(Break through) These barriers of pain
(Break through) Yeah, into the sunshine, from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out
For you now
Somehow I have to make this 
Final breakthrough
(Now!) Oh yeah

Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey, you're starting something
Deep inside of me
Honey, you're sparking something
This fire in me
I'm outta control
I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough!
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh yeah

(Breakthrough)
(Breakthrough)
(Break-)
Hey!

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough

Breakthrough!

// Rain Must Fall //

I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey

Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall

No problem, uh
Be cool, now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey

You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall

You lead a fairy-tale existence
But into every life
A little rain must fall

Be cool
Ha!
Kiss, kiss

Others seem to think
You are over-dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions
Honey

You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall

Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright

Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain

// Scandal //

Scandal
Now you've left me
All the world's gonna know
Hey, scandal
They're gonna turn our lives
Into a freak show

They'll see the heartache
They'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading
We'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over again

Scandal
Now you've left me
There's no healing the wounds
Hey, scandal
And all the world
Can make us out to be fools

Here come the bad news
Open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding
We say, "You cheapskates!"
Over and over and over again

So let them know when they stare
It's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
And tell me what do they care

It's only a life to be
Twisted and broken
They'll see the heartache
They'll see our love break, yeah
They'll hear me pleading
I'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over
And over again, yeah

(Scandal) (Scandal)
(Scandal) (Scandal)
Yes, you're breaking my heart again
(Scandal) Yes, you're loving
On out again

Today: the headlines
Tomorrow: hard times
And no-one ever really knows
The truth from the lies
And in the end, the story
Deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside

(Scandal) (Scandal)
(Scandal) (Scandal)

// My Baby Does Me //

Turn it up a bit, please

My baby, baby does
My baby does me good
My baby does
My baby does me
My baby does me good

My lady understands
Understands me right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right

My baby cares, she really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me
That she cares
Another day she tells me
She don't love me

She really, really does me, ooh
Now people do you believe this?
Do you? Ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Uh, she really, really
Really, really, really, really
Ah, does me, hey

// Was It All Worth It //

What is there left for me
To do in this life?
Did I achieve what I had
Set in my sights?
Am I a happy man
Or is this sinking sand?
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
Yeah, now hear my story
Let me tell you about it

We bought a drum kit
I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit
Thought we were perfect

Was it all worth it?
Ooh, giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
A godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it all these years?

Put down our money
Without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won
If we lost
Yes, we were vicious
Yes, we could kill
Yes, we were hungry
Yes, we were brill

We served a purpose
Like a bloody circus
We were so dandy
We love you madly

Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
This godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
When the hurly burly's done

We went to Bali
Saw God and Dali
So mystic, surrealistic

Was it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!
Giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, living breathing rock 'n' roll
This never ending fight
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?

Yes, it was a worthwhile experience, ha ha ha ha!
It was worth it!

// Hang On In There //

Don't let go
Don't lose your mystique
Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast
Don't let go
Don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive
You're still in one piece

Hang on in there
Don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there
Forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment (straight ahead)
And it will appear
Don't fight for lost emotions!
Wait for the sunrise
And everything will seem so clear
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead!)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear
Don't be a fool

You haven't reached your peak
You got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete

Hang on in there
Hang on in there!
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear!
(Wait for that moment)
Wait for the sunrise (Ah)
Just wait and see, and it will seem so clear
(Duh duh bap bee dee bup bup bup, duh da dup dee da, hey!)

And let's go, let's go!
OK, now do the change up
Yeah!
Hang in there!
(Hang on in there)
Yeah, hang on in there!
Yeah!

// Hijack My Heart //

Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steal my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart

Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
'Cause I've never seen anything to compare with your smile
I've never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be

// Stealin' //

That's the way I am
Does anybody want to know
This is the way I lead my life - you know
Wheeling and dealing
And a little bit of stealing
You know that's the way I grew up
That's the only life I know
That's the way my mother taught me
There you go

Stealing
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone in charge of my heart
Hey stealing
You got me wheeling and dealing
You play with my feeling
Right from the start

Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe - oho
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealing is the only way that I know

Stealing yeah only way that I know
Yeah I like stealing baby stealing
I gave you both my heart and my home
Left you alone
Now you'll be stealing stealing stealing
All my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh uh

Baby let 'em bleed

You're in charge of my heart
You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge
You are in charge

Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

Yes you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And turned on the bed
I gave you the key
Down on what I said
What have I got
What have I got

Yes
I, I got the key out of my heart
Now get that key out of my heart
You're in charge of my heart
Come on
