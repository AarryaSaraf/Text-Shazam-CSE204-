Album: YouOnlyLive2wice

// 20 Karat Jesus //

Yeah, kane
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

My ambitions as a rider, nigga
Survival off that powder, nigga
Currently smoking that kill in the hills
Where you can't find a nigga
Crack cocaine, microwave
Dealer was on that type of nigga
No sleep, bags under my eyes is designer, nigga
Blinded and misguided, nigga
Heavenly father take the wheel
I'm on the interstate with some Guerrillas
With shit can get me like 200 years
Thug in the pen, I need forgiveness
I'm living like a every decision a sin
I know my niggas don't want me to win
Jealousy, chopping off all of my friends

I ride with that white-white
Just like Fight Night we be weighin' in
P.D is my pieces, 20 karats, Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Spent my last 200 thou' on a bird and a Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS300
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it, now they only here to Michael Jones it
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the elevator
The goal when you try to kick that dope
Stuck on the respirator
Got symptoms of withdrawal from the fall when I used to ball
I show you how in one summer one nigga could lose it all
Like why we gotta feel this pain in our friends and family though
My cellie like to walk around in his sleep I rather stay woke
I must evoke, these are the results of the realest shit that I wrote
These hoes get in the wind, burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes

That's why I ride with that white-white
Just like Fight Night we be weighin' in
P.D is my pieces, 20 karats, Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Split my last two hundered thou' on a bird and Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up off the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it now they only here to Michael Jones it
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

I-I-I be kickin shit just like Rodman did the camera man
I peel 100 dope like the poppy seed in Afghanistan
I been to drop by nuts but these cabbage hands do damage nigga
Rips from the clip leave you stiff, mannequin challenge nigga
Me and my chips with dip boy ain't no play play 'bout that Frito-Lay
Tried to give me ten I beat the case so it's gon' be okay
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
Mama say I live next door to the death 'cause I live in the moment

Don't live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
I'll be there in the morning
Nigga I'm living in the moment
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there in the morning

Yah
Kane baby
I drank holy water

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Scar across my face, strap on my shoulder on some Tony shit
Taught myself the streets, you know my pop ain't never taught me shit
'Cept "Fuck a friend you gon' be solo in your coffin bitch"
Walkin' home from work my.44 pulled up what I'm walking with
Old folks out the church say "He need Jesus that boy off a bit"
Preacher's daughter said "I'll let you fuck it just might cost a bit"
Type a shit a nigga been through make you dog a bitch
Lost a bitch a bitch, married these streets, she prenup you can't divorce her
Lying from my cell electrical tape on my tape recorder, sucker shit
Don't blow your money, young nigga pay your lawyer
Niggas is wrapped in electrical tape
They walking tape recorders, yeah

Yeah, bitch your first motherfucing mixtape was a snitch tape
You ain't think I knew that shit though I know though

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Drove on 65, brought 65 I sold the whole shit
Popo searched my cutlass on the road I got my own shit
Boy you know the rules they pick you up don't call my phone bitch
Boy you know the rules that shit don't jump unless you sold it down
S.W.A.T Team break, they cut the water off, can't flush the toilet down
454 my motor down
Got green, got dough, got yola now
They playin' they suffer exposure now
This rapper shit just for the posers now
The losers now, all these bitch niggas got videos up with their toolies out
Everybody flashing real money, niggas card credit, getting visa money
I don't knock it I just do the dope and blow it
I gotta get it so I gotta see the money
Y'all remember peacing out 28th to get the blunt liquor and a piece of money young nigga

Young Nigga
Stay smooth, stay solid nigga
These niggas put your name on anything but a prayer
Amen
Glory be to God, what's happening pimps?
It is I, the alpha and omega, the original righteous player
You know what I'm talking about?
It's your boy Jesus man
Yes my nigga Jesus is your homeboy
Say it again so I can uh reiterate it man
Your minds not ready and your heart's not open
You know what I'm saying?
That's what's wrong with you man
You doing all that coveting
You trying to, you wan't what other niggas got
You not even just paying attention to your gift nigga
God gave you a gift nigga
Pay attention to what he got for you
You, other niggas over here
Yah he could sell dope real good, that's not your lane my nigga
God gave you hands, you a chef my nigga
Chef up that boysenberry crème brûlée man

// Alexys //

Kane, Nigga

Baby Scarface

I first taste cocaine in 10th grade (Yah)
Homie at the table chopping Rick James
Sent the package off from Texas it's been six days
Keep sweating like a pig until that bitch came
Nigga had to keep a job living off in my momma's spot
Fuck it I'm a bust a fucking jugg I'm a juggernaut
Choppers on chop it off in that water we was cooking in (Yah)
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushing out
Feds looking because I peddled pain to these poor folks

The hardest nigga that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand I hit the burner (Woo)
And I brought that dog back to the set nigga you know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion backs
Keep this strictly business you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowing all my friends, niggas thinking small (Yah)
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get shit was all (Yah)
Turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off (Yah)
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings dog (Bitch)
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention
And these the niggas I'm cool with
My enemies I have yet to mention Fuck 'em

I got cake bitch can't everyday be my birthday (Yah)
You can't take me off first place on my worst day (Yah)
Streets dry niggas thirsty
So I pray that when they come and take me that this mini draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some underneath-the-earth shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip (Woo)
Black as hell but rap got me thinking I need a foreign bitch (Woo)
Take my black queens for granted got me ignoring them

Names I be calling her nigga I know you be dogging her
What kind of man is you that your hood, niece and yo daughter nem. (Yah)
I'm posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in (Woo)
Ving Rhames guns, butter niggas get margarine (Yah)
Pussy niggas can't play they part we dearly departed them
Crip like OJ Simpson you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight
And I know the streets take
Niggas out the game my baby momma told me be safe (Why)
Turned around and said fuck safe I stay dangerous (Yah)
In the set with Sodi no chopper my chain dangling (Word Up)
In the set with deuce I be blood and we gang ganging 'em
My nigga Corleone and Diego they smash craniums (Yah)
Living life on high speed nigga that's just the lane we in
About to cop a Porsche from that the packet that Freddie Kane gettin'

You can't take me off first place on my worst day (Yah)
Streets dry niggas thirsty
So I pray that when they come and take me that this mini draco make the earth shake

Take my black queens for granted got me ignoring them

// Crushed Glass //

Diego, roll me one up, my nigga

The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga

I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said "A paid nigga"
With connections out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was thuggin' with my trey eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-Date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case, groupie bitch I never fucked
Trying to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers, had to level up

Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
If I gotta be by myself, I'm a be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
And if I gotta be by myself, I'm a be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up

The future started yesterday nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga

Had a baby, now my daughter getting up in age, nigga
When I die I bet she say, "My daddy was a paid nigga"
'Round the world jail system like a slave trade, nigga
Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower ain't bathed or shaved nigga
I was sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass

Future started yesterday nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga

Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out where your heart at, nigga
Black Tony, Babyface, better scar that nigga
Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga
Gangsta G, I fucked the industry, them crackers say I'm too aggressive
I turned myself into a boss without a fuckin' question
Six whips, ghetto nigga gotta be excessive
I came up on fried bologna, boy what you expected?
What you expected?

Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
If I gotta be by myself, I'm a be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
Living this life, just me myself and I
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up
And if I gotta be by myself, I'm a be alright
Level up, you know a nigga had to level up

Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life
Ooh, I will be alright
Ooh, I will live my life

Squadary

I went to visit my nigga he caught him a charge his cards

Time to go get me some yayo
I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fucking armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin' almost felt my heart stopping G
Stop it G, Drop it G
So much weed forgot to breathe
Some niggas take the tip I took but they don't get to leave
Came out that bitch speaking Russian, German, Lebanese
Can't let these niggas stunt my growth from living for my seed
Level up I'm on a stage I gotta get paid

Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill em with K's
Level up I'm on a stage I gotta get paid

Since I came home, police across the street taking pictures right when I came home
Since I came home, right when I came home
Since I came home, police across the street taking pictures right when I came home

I just almost lost it all, for my niggas
Just sat in the cell, ten thousand miles away from my child, for my niggas
It's when I realized I gotta start living for my child, and not my niggas
I remember not having nothing to read in the cell for a whole month you know what I mean?
The fucking guards took me to the library and all the books was in German and shit, you know what I'm saying nigga?
That almost broke me down you know
Erica flew all the way over there
Brought a nigga some books, know what I'm saying?
She held me down, know what I mean?
Through all the bullshit, all my bullshit she held me down
I love her for that
I'm back
And I ain't going nowhere this time
