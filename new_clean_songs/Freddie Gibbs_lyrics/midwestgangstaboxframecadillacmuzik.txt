// Midwest Malcolm //

Inhale, exhale this shit
That gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Some people ain't fit to this shit, ain't hip to this shit
But you know what I'm sayin, I'm gonna spit this shit
I tell motherfuckers like this, I tell 'em all the time
When the world becomes perfect, maybe I'll rap about that shit

It's on, and once again I bring niggas the realest
Viciously vivid, straight explosive, highly explicit
Got my broke ass off of my momma's couch and I started pitchin'
Cause bitches ain't checking for a nigga working at the Village
Slanging Volvos, pushing the bucket sedan four doors
I needed a Lexus coupe sittin' on 20's with a set of MOMOs
A young old soul so I stay in the frame
Let's put this thang up and get some paint and just throw my shit on them thangs
And I be rollin', shine but never let them know just what you holdin
Better keep that thing on tuck, I know niggas that's making bucks serving cain uncut
Used to pay me to take that dust on the Greyhound bus
Now I'm my own man, grown man, deal with my own dirt
Perfectly pounding the payment and purchase my own work
Benefit from the killer shit that's making my phone twerk
Say she don't know no Freddie G, well bitch do your homework
No hoes in my history can shit on Gibbs
Grew up amongst the crack babies and the flintstone kids
17th and Pennsylvania bitch, my whole fucking block poor
Couldn't afford a baby crib, I slept up in a sock drawer (damn)
Interscope they thought it was a joke but it was not so
They tried to have a nigga do that fast food pop flow
I'm secret with ingredients, my lyrics is home cooked
Some reefer and a yellow bitch that's thick as a phone book
All I need, a fool with the tools to succeed
Take this G out of me then you mix it with Cali weed
I would say that this shit turned me to a monster but bitch I've been a beast
Gangster Gibbs greasy as a church's chicken 20-piece
It should be mandatory that this shit is self-explanatory
Malcolm of the mid, no other nigga in my category
It's mandatory that this shit is self-explanatory
Malcolm of the mid, no other nigga in my category
Gibbs

// Boxframe Cadillac //

[Hook:]
Maybe it's that... maybe it's that... maybe it's that
Dro that I'm smokin got me rollin, slow motion
I'm blowin' dough that's so potent, got a nigga coughin and chokin
I'm in that... Boxframe cadillac, swervin off the exit ramp
Split my swisha with my thumb, rolling hydroponic plants

[Verse 1:]
I got the bass bangin, window cracked
Breakin down a reefer sack
Big money grip with an ounce of that piff and a fo-fifth in my lap
I'm in that boxframe cadillac, swervin off the exit ramp
Split my swisha with my thumb nigga roll that hydroponic plant
Pine the 'gnac, mix it with the red bull, take another pull of this dodey
This endo, roll up that window
If you see me rollin in I'm smokin, guarantee, fire weed
Not a stick, not a seed, pack of blunts all I need
I'm about to get sent up I don't give no fuck man I'm all about gettin fried
I don't know how they do it where you reside
GI niggas smoke and ride
So if you with it, catch a contact
Non smokers fall back, we can chit-chat
I'd rather be in, gone in the 'llac

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
Yo I've been smokin since a youngin
Coppin halfs and quarter onions
Peach optimo, fillin it with that leafy green stuffin
And my nigga [?] he used to smoke one with me after practice
Fuckin batches, cuttin classes and constantly dumpin ashes
And I miss my dude, wishin I could still be with my dude
I'd give it all up to get him back I swear to God
All the money, cars and this pencil juice
Yeah I smoke that G-5 blaze
Just to ease the stress and pain
Mama think I'm strange
Maryjane put alot of evil thoughts in my brain
Alotta times man I be on that murda shit
Hit me with the spinach if you got a problem with it you can tell that to my burner bitch
Please don't make me act a fool
Tryna keep my cool
But my head, missing screws
So you know it ain't no doubt I'm a straight jab out
Like I ain't got shit to lose

[Hook]

// Sumthin' U Should Know //

[x3]
{Hey bitch, fuck with me, what's up?}

[Verse 1:]
Your bitch wanna fuck with Gibbs
Straight dick off in the ribs
Got her trickin off chips
On expensive trips just to see the kids
Never been one the one to miss no hoes
Watch how the OG's pimp on hoes
I was in it for the rank and the disco hoes
Way back when a nigga couldn't get no hoes, I
Gotta step my game up
Lifted my frame up
Twenty-four's on the cud
Make hoes wanna fuck
When I turn that thang up
These hoes in the game wanna get saved
But a pimp like me got to get paid
Pull em to the side, gotta check they age
Keep it real with em when they come backstage

[Hook:]
Baby yo there's something you should know
I don't really spend time on no ho
I just wanna hit that ass and go
I don't give a fuck about you

Bitch if you ain't with it hit the door
Let a nigga sit back puff his dro
Watch the panties hit the floor

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
I don't really care bout no bitches
I'm on my business
It costs to keep my attention
And they trippin, I dismiss em
It's not a flaw in my pimpin', no sir
Fuck a bitch, pimp a ho, get your dough up
Penthouse, top floor, let's go up
Got a fat sack of dro we can roll up
Hey bitch, fuck with me, what's up

[Hook:]
Baby yo, there's something you should know
Is there somewhere we should go?
We can keep it on the low (I just wanna show you)
How we lay this pimpin' down fo sho
Put that hustle on the ho
Let the panties hit the floor

[Verse 3:]
What it is, what it gon be?
I got a broad on the phone, G
Chilling with a homie
And I know that it's a goddamn shame
That they all on me
Wanna give me that monkey
I'm a flip some dough instead
Keep pimpin', stack that bread
All I gotta do is get a bitch fed
Then I get em in the bed
And I'm all in they head
Big dough, I'm stackin' it
My pimpin' is immaculate
And I just might have to smack a bitch
If my figures ain't accurate
You treat these hoes, I cheat these hoes
I fuck soon as I meet these hoes
Then I take em to the room
And I get up in they womb
And I straight dip off and leave these hoes
Got a couple in the Chi, got a couple in the D
Got a bitch in Minnesota
Got a ho in Ohio that hold that dough when with they hold up
Niggas out G, I stay midwest pimpin'
That's what we be bout
Midwest pimpin' in the east, midwest pimpin' in the south
I got a bitch in LA that think she too famous to turn a trick
But I know the bitch will let a nigga put a dick in her anus to pay the rent
These hoes don't give a fuck
Anything for another quick buck
Bitch hop off in this truck
Is you fuckin' with me what's up?

[Hook x2]

You can ride with me
Slide with me
And vibe with me
Get high with me
We can go wherever you want to go
Continue to get throwed
But there's something you should know

[Hook]

[Outro: x3]
I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday ho

Niggas out here bluffin, mother had 'em, mother love 'em, motherfuck 'em
Cause even they mothers won't be able to identify 'em

[Hayes:]
Fuck them fake niggas they don't know what loyal is, dropped out of school and started fights with the spoiled kids
Thought I was broke 'til I discovered what a brick was, 850 thousand got me big love
Tricked some, became a legend in them strip clubs, but I was bigger in the streets from fuckin with them thugs
A hood rat's dream, a ghetto nigga's idol, we the champions in the streets man we hold the title
Made more money off the block than preachers with them bibles, don't be steppin out of line that gets suicidal
I got a lot of killers, we got a lot of guns, no respect for shit, murder anyone

This is for my niggas, this is for my nigga-nigga

[Hayes & Freddie Gibbs:]
Hayes the heroin man, Gibbs slang them the weed
You got what they want, I got what they need
These niggas bleed for the yola from Gary to Minnesota, hold the toaster 'til I'm rolling in Rovers and Testarossas and Bentleys without the top, what you got?
No patience and an army of hundred niggas that's outside waiting, for a nigga to front, that'll get him Christmas treed
Lit up real good in front his whole family
Man, this ain't no fuckin game, you don't wanna see me with that thang
Ducked off in a cud box with an SK and a Glock don't test my aim
Don't test my crew keep more protection than an AIDS clinic, trunk big enough to fit you, ten bricks, and a gauge in it
Yeah, hundred round drum in my [?], and niggas'll [?] if they get out of line
Pull out the llama, you dead where you layin, and bullets will spray if you fuckin with mine, nigga
I love my block, they make that hood paper stack for me, my mother proud of me, still think its rap money

This is for my niggas, this is for my nigga-nigga
This is for my niggas, my niggas on the block

This is for my niggas, this is for my nigga-nigga
This is for my niggas, my niggas on the block

This is for my niggas, this is for my nigga-nigga
This is for my niggas, my niggas on the block

This is for my niggas, this is for my nigga-nigga
This is for my niggas, my niggas on the block

// Murda On My Mind //

I Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
My nigga boutta hit me with another throw away burner around 9
So I get up get back on my shit
Working off a pack never had no brick
17 homeboys up in the clip
Before I beg like a bitch I'm a hit me a lick
On everythang
Lay you on that stretcher man
Bust that thang or rest in flames when you disrespect the game
Can't do that don't sell cocaine
Cock that four fifth back and aim
Do my dirt all by my self
No witnesses to say my name
I'm fresh up out a city where most niggas broke
60% unemployment... why you think we sellin dope?
Lil kids walk around with that issue pistols you gotta tote
Don't get caught sleepin these G.I. streets'll leave you comatose

I got my gun you got your gun but will you bust your burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder
I got my gun you got your gun but will you bust your burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder

Aye bitch fuck with me what's up
I'm... not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my Grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga I'm knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me what's up
I'm... not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga I'm knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me what's up

How many niggas can remember the
First time you had to ride out on your enemy
Ski mask over my skull to cover my identity
I'm a make these niggas bleed and vacate the vicinity
Bustin off that chopper my knocka
Never been no thang to me
You can add me up I'm straight 100 and its plain to see
Let's talk with heaters you can miss me with that fakery
These niggas really ain't the killers that they claim to be
Chillin on a back street loadin up the black piece
Bout to go and hit em with his execution
And don't get caught up in the middle
Cause the bullets gonna riddle
You can forget about a resolution
I'll send a nigga to his maker
Get away with the paper
And disapear into the night like a ghost
One false move and that's all she wrote
100 thousand niggas in this city
Over half them of them mutha fuckas probably comin at my throat

I pack my toast bust I my burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder
Bitch one more time I said
I pack my toast I bust my burner
Niggas pack heat but they don't really want that murder murder

Hey bitch fuck with me what's up
I'm... not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my Grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga I'm knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me what's up
I'm... not gonna let bitch niggas knock me off my grind
Off my grind
Woke up this morning with murder on my mind
Nigga I'm knee deep in this beefin
Out here creepin and squeezin
Give a nigga one reason Ill leave niggas leakin
Aye bitch fuck with me what's up

[Freddie Gibbs:]

Trunk full of that {?} , finna go make a stain with that cocaine
I'm on my way to cop it, chop it, gotta get paper, bitch

Niggas thought they could phase the kid
Step back and appraise the kid
The neck is lit, this major shit
Niggas ain't do me no favors, bitch
Don't ask for none
And niggas that ain't my peeps shouldn't even think to speak
I pack them guns, they yap and run
You showed them my buzz?

We taking and making that dough, nigga
Jacking and breaking them o's, nigga
Ask any motherfucker on my block
Ms. Watts ain't raise no hoes nigga
I keep a bitch on her toes, nigga
Freddie the one that she chose, nigga
My dough bigger, my flow sicker than most niggas
I show bitches that I ain't the one they be playing with
I'm 'bout my money, my paper, my cheddar, my bread
You hear me jap out on these beats
'Cause I'm in the streets, the streets is keeping me fed
These niggas 'll leave me for dead, if they get the chance
Come at my head to try to advance, but will I last?
Fuck yea-'cause I'm 'a blast, nigga

From the cradle to the grave, the womb to the tomb

[Pill:]
Ey, I can't be hospitable
If the shit ain't profitable
Send him to the hospital slow
Then we gon' let his children know
Can't go places that Pill 'll go
Might post up at the liquor store
Chop it down and distribute blow
Might get fresh and go pimp a hoe
I didn't know that's your sister, though
Look, stand under this mistletoe
Give that four-five, a kiss, you bitch
'Fore I let this trigger go
Cold-hearted for cash, a damn dummy for ducats
Sold the hardest of glass
My fam hungry, I'm bugging
Trucking, tucking, don't get stuck in shit
What is this?
The components of a fuck-you-upper, knuckle upper
Gutter nigga, throw the baking soda
Drop her proper
English for the slow guys, Bacon Double Whopper
I need more cheese and more fries
From the rocker to the doctor
Delivery room to the morgue
If you live by the sword
Take this chopper, go get guaped up
Or get killed trying for it
Take this chopper, go get guaped up
Or get killed trying for it

[Freddie Gibbs:]

I'm 'a get down for my pay, nigga
Spray niggas, lay niggas out flat
"Will he live?"
"I doubt that"
Murder shit, I'm 'bout that
All the shit surrounding that
Got niggas with cases, tears on faces
Snitches conversating down at the station
I smell bacon, so I'm laying low
Still gotta get that paper, yo
Pimp a bitch, break a hoe
'Til I come up on that major dough
I could come up on some major blow
Been in the Bay with that major weed
Played the field, with major pills
The shit that I got give niggas the chills
This is the way that I live for real
Young and trill
I brung the steel against they will
My lungs is filled with Cali kill
I got that yac so crack the seal
I stack them bill to half a mill
Praying I never go broke again
Got money-making methods
And they respect it, whether they folks or (fed?)
Refuse to lose and hope to win
Strictly getting paid
From the womb to the tomb
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave, the womb to the tomb
I'm 'a get it, win or lose
I'm just out here making moves
From the womb to the tomb, to the cradle to the grave

// County Bounce //

Woke up this morning shackled head to toe in a county jail
I ain't even do shit, I'mma call up a bitch, I'mma see if she can post my bail
I was, rollin' and smokin' that dro, drop top Cut' fo'- fiftay-fo' (454)
Shining on a motherfuckin' po, he was jealous as hell, that's why he threw a nigga in this hole
At a certain point of time, man I lost my way
But it really ain't no justification for the things I be on today
I'm just doing what I gotta do I'm out here
Coppin' and choppin that twerk, kush weed, killa codeine, and purp
Ball til ya fall, all goddamn long, but understand when you fall, you can fall face first
So that's when my uncle O sat a nigga down, set a nigga straight, and he said "Nigga, set yo goals"
Be easy, take shit slow, but don't ever let a muhfucka, slow yo roll
Pockets stay swole and if you keep your eyes on the prize, then they gon get thicker
Some of your homies might go out like bitches, the real niggas gon' be still here with ya

Lost control of my soul in a world so cold
So fasho, never fold, they can't slow ma roll
To da homies up above I miss ya
Keep a muhfucka pourin out liquor, talkin to me while I'm blowin out swishas, sayin "freddie yo I'm still here with ya, rollin"
I been smokin dis O, so emotional
So fasho, never fold they can't slow ma roll
To da homies in da pen I miss ya, waitin for da day that I can come get ya, steady sendin out kites and pictures, just to let ya know I'm still here with ya, rollin

I might not send out kites and visit like I should, bruh
Got so much on my mind, spend some time, I wish I could, bruh
I'm hustlin' and duckin' police
Got me out here strugglin' to eat
A nigga try to do what he can
To keep it right with ya fam
But yo I gotta stay up on my feet
This music shit been kinda sluggish
Gotta keep my lights on so I stay thuggin'
Swear that I would stop if the streets didn't love it
Certain days man I wanna say fuck it
But I does it, do it, did it better than most niggas do this
And from the get-go I done let 'em know that it's all cause of you
I'ma hold to my new shit
Wouldn't be no me if there wasn't no Will Scrill, CCA, Outside, MCGz
Pioneers of my city help me pave my way
So I pay my dues and I see the big picture
Let's get together we can get dope quicker
I hit the studio and burn out Swishers
To let my niggas know I'm still here with ya

// How I Feel //

I'm just rolling, smoking
Going through the motions
Blowed as I roll the kill
I got the roof wide open
Backwood toking
Doing what the fuck I feel
That's how I feel, feel, feel, feel, you know the deal
That's how I feel, feel, feel
I"m just doing what the fuck I feel

I'm trying to hold something
I'm trying to roll something
Let me get up on the zip-zip zone
Of that issue, tryna get-get gone
Trying to get-get blown
Fly high like G4 gettin flown
Cause I ain't sly about me and
My family getting stoned
[?] jog, the windows smokey, man
We spinning chrome
Nouveau and Patron on my breath
Through the streets we roam
Getting my grown-man on, VIP getting dome
Atlantis strip club, hundred long
And showty's thong
On my coupe, shit
Rolling another [?]
Nothing but purple pinapple Urkel that kush shit
That presidential Obama - no, not that Bush shit
Do it for real, cause nigga, that's how the real does
For real cause, they rolling like I"m on pills cause...

A visual woodsman, turned it into a skill cause...
City is still where we be blowing that kill cause
Sit back relax blow back, that's how I feel cause...

I'm just rolling, smoking
Going through the motions
Blowed as I roll the kill
I got the roof wide open
Backwood toking
Doing what the fuck I feel
That's how I feel, feel, feel, feel, you know the deal
That's how I feel, feel, feel
I"m just doing what the fuck I feel

Sometimes I wake up break up shake up roll a [?] up blazin straight kill
Some days I sip yac and bless the cap before I break the seal
Sit back with my sack relax and watch two bitches take a pill
Pussy the purple kushy, bitch we push them whatever pays the bills
Some days I don't feel like answering your call, don't sweat no broads, it ain't bout cash I won't hit back at all
Sometimes I feel like your bitch feeling me too much, feel like she wanna feel up on these nuts
Give a little bit of dick up in them guts, I might have the ho pitchin off that dust
Feel like I'm going through the, going through the motions
Everyday the same routine, but I'm never ever not gon' feel like smoking
Never gon' let you play me and just fade away
Fuck a pistol bring your K to play, I feel I feel I hurt these niggas feelings in a major way
So if you feelin like I'm feelin start that car remove the ceiling
Whether you stock rim dippin or chrome wheel whippin
If you feelin like I feel you feelin so real
Man I'm just doin what the fuck I feel, just what the fuck I feel

I'm just rolling, smoking
Going through the motions
Blowed as I roll the kill
I got the roof wide open
Backwood toking
Doing what the fuck I feel
That's how I feel, feel, feel, feel, you know the deal
That's how I feel, feel, feel
I"m just doing what the fuck I feel

// Talkin' Bout You //

I like the way this feel
Bitch for real
Bitch I'm talkin' bout you
You know that bitch a ho
Tap her on the shoulder
Let her know, know what I mean
Keep it real with a bitch, know what I mean?

I always knew you was a greazy bitch
Tried to warn my homie but he didn't believe me bitch
Its a shame how you had dude trickin his chips
Less than a week later you was on my dick
Got his nose wide open, not to mention his wallet
Every chance he got he was comin out of pocket
You trippin my nigga, how you gon let this bitch hustle you
Wonder why this grown-ass man was so gullible
So stupid, she fuck with any nigga on the team
Bitch got a thing for diamond rings and ding-a-lings
On the floor, shopping sprees and fur coats
You pumped her head up now she think she the most
I just beat the pussy up and get ghost
And I never spend a penny, bitches supply me with hydro and Henny
I'm just speakin on the thangs you do

Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the thangs you do
Down to bust down every nigga in my crew
Not my lady, not my baby, and you ain't my boo
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the rats that you roll with
Gon admit your whole clique on some ho shit
And if I wanted I could fuck them too
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you

So can you taste it ho it ain't no game
You gon make a nigga say yo name
Bitch I'm talkin to you
So can you taste it ho it ain't no game
You gon make a nigga say yo name
Bitch I'm talkin bout
Keisha, Leisha, April and Alicia
Nothing but them dog-ass hoes and straight skeezers
Type of bitch to come to your spot and smoke up your reefer
Then wanna give you brain, bitch drop some change
On this mothafuckin doity you puffin on
Put up on my reefer sack or leave it the fuck alone
You hoes want Patron shots and Grey Goose
Thinking a nigga gon supply your liquor just cause you cute
Well goddamn, I am, appalled at y'all frauds
I ain't in it for the drawers, you all on my balls
Don't answer y'all calls
And you wonder why you can't get through

Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the thangs you do
Down to bust down every nigga in my crew
Not my lady, not my baby, and you ain't my boo
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the rats that you roll with
Gon admit your whole clique on some ho shit
And if I wanted I could fuck them too
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you

You bitch nigga, you trick niggas
She playing with your dick and you payin her rent nigga
I specialize in this pimpin and breakin these hoes
Charge it all to a bitch, nigga that's how it goes
But who knows, I might bump into two hoes that's bout that action
Met em in the lobby, I'm probably gon be smashin
If I can get em to the suite, I'd rather hit the streets
So pat your feet to the street bitch, mash for rations
I was in the cranberry Chevy with Rosemary
Nymphomaniac from Gary who strip at the Black Cherry
But her momma think she work as a medical secretary
In the day but in the evenin she doin what's necessary
Just to stay up in them Gucci boots, suck a dick in the coupe
They say I'm hard on these heifers I just tell the truth
Cause I'm just speaking on the thangs they do

Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the thangs you do
Down to bust down every nigga in my crew
Not my lady, not my baby, and you ain't my boo
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you (you you you)
And all the rats that you roll with
Gon admit your whole clique on some ho shit
And if I wanted I could fuck them too
Don't look around like you ain't got no clue
Bitch I'm talkin bout you

And you, and you, and you, and you
I see you girl (bitch)
I see you girl (haha)
I'm off them ragged-ass hoes man

// Still Standing //

Bodies get laid out
Parties get sprayed out
When they get to trippin it's best to be up in the house
Not on no scared shit nigga that grown man shit
You out for the count if you get put down on this canvas
Switch up your demeanor when you step up in this arena
Shoot up benzes n beamers gangsters got heaters in the steamers
Remember we used to bump that Teila? and get super zooded
I ran with killers whatever they did a nigga was down to do it
He serve a geeker I serve a geeker even when it was snowing
He started rapping shortly after that than I started flowing
I was slammin that dodey he was whippin em with the hard
Treat him like a big brother held this nigga in high regard
Than the bullshit start
The choppers get cocked
Cause niggas around my away don't fight no more gotta be like kobe
Nice with them shots
A nigga I thought was my homie tried to dome me twice with his Glock
But all of that show me is ninety percent of ya niggas is phony and what not
This ain't beef nigga

Uh fuck that beef shit
That shit is played out

It's all a part of my miseducation
It left me with this complex occupation
And put me in some awkward situations
And any nigga know that niggas just don't talk they just start blazing
Stay patient

Oh no
I know somebody gotta feel me
Never knew true love until my homie tried to kill me
Show me all the love I showed was true but niggas is filthy
Niggas is down to get money with you but they really won't show you the real G
Running with niggas that steal from me then got me caught up
And niggas be quick to defend themselves whenever the shit get brought up
And you never know what these niggas be on so when they approach me I bust
The kid stay sucka free I shook them fleas up off of my nuts
I'm at the lab and a ho nigga was talkin greasy one day
He said I know you and that bitch I'm sitting outside with this K
I move in silence all that phony tough violence is gay
The price of life is high niggas still got hell to pay
So fuck what you heard I Imma stank em and be complacing
They bust a bird shot but I Dick Chenney these niggas faces
Niggas bout to make me go off
Motherfucker wanna walk shit till a body part get blown off
Pussy you got a K come blow my dough off nigga
This ain't beef

(I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
Gibbs, ho (I'm the man in my city)
And you niggas know (I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
That I'm out the east side of that G.I. (I'm the man in my city)

We don't die, we just multiply
Keep a full clip in my.45
I'm that dude, and I'm that guy (I'm the man in my city)

Haters say my swagger be rubbing niggas the wrong way
I don't give a damn what the radio say, cause my records they gon' play
Off in the streets, and my niggas with the beat, got me banging up broadway
Go against me, roll a blunt, pack a lunch, cause you in for a long day (Okay)
Since the age of 19, I been crushing niggas' rap dreams
Roll took me under his wing, I crushed the Gary rap scene
Fresh off and I took shit major
Show you niggas how to get that paper
Who the fuck being broke with a whole lot of friends?
You the man, if you got them haters
You can flow, but you ain't no gangster
Talk about it but you ain't gonna bust shit
Y'all niggas know me, FG
In the booth or the street man I can't be fucked with
And a nigga gotta earn my plate
Cook real slow, never burn my cake
Jack that nigga if he's herd that weight
Put you on the floor, t-shirt your face
All about the money and I just can't wait
To make it to the top, I'mma take my place
With or without the deal, I've still got kill on deck so I'm gonna be straight
A nigga 'bout to take what's owed to me
Lock shit down like it's supposed to be
Killing who ever opposes me
You niggas ain't nothing but hoes to me

(I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
Gibbs, ho (I'm the man in my city)

I'm that dude, and I'm that guy (I'm the man in my city)

(Bitch, what it do)
I'm the man in my city, I get land in my city
I be the one that the bitches be on and niggas can't stand in my city (Nigga)
And part of the reason for that is most of these niggas be trying to rap
They hating on me cause they wack
Say what you want, cause I'm fine with that
Run up on me, and that iron'll clap
Ghetto, cause I was designed for that
Raised in the G, so the R.E.S.P.E.C.T., I'm down for that
Don't know what you doing for yours
Freddie ain't stunting and fronting for whores
Until I go sit with the Lord
I'mma be living the shit I record
I'mma be living the shit that I spin
I go to work when I get on these beats
We don't do the footwork, y'all niggas get hurt
Stomped in the club, nigga, watch my feet
Better yet, nigga, watch your bitch
Cause any minute, she gonna watch this dick
Straight nuts in her face, I'mma put it on tape
Motherfucker, you can watch this shit
And she gonna let my nigga Rock go on and hit
And she gonna let my nigga Jay buss her down
Big wheel ain't gon let the bitch hit the kill
We gonna send her straight back to your town
That's how a nigga do his thang up in the G
Ain't really worried about the nigga you claim to be
If you ain't talking about the IN, then, then it really don't pertain to me
You know it's...

(I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
Gibbs, ho (I'm the man in my city)
And you niggas know (I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
That I'm out the east side of that G.I. (I'm the man in my city)
We don't die, we just multiply
Keep a full clip in my.45
I'm that dude, and I'm that guy (I'm the man in my city)
You niggas know (I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)
Hey bitches, Gibbs, ho (I'm the man in my city)
And you niggas know (I'm the man in - I'm the, I'm the)

I'm trying to take a bitch home
Hoes know what I'm on
Couple blunts to the dome and I'm in that zone
Nigga, and my Hennessy bottle is almost gone
Got a clean boxframe outside on chrome
Woah, girl, I know you wanna roll with a nigga
Smoke something and blow a little dough with a nigga
But I don't trip for no bitch, I give a shit
Nigga, bussdown your whole click
Cause I'm a pimp that don't slip
I'm only in town for one night
I ain't looking for a wife
I'm looking to lay the pipe
I'm looking to blow another bitch back out
Fuck up her hair weave and pull a couple tracks out

I got the yack by the fifth, got weed by the pound
So a groupie bitch is all a nigga need when I come around
Cause I only got one night in town
And I know that you down to bussdown

And she thick with it, she need to go on, let a nigga hit it
Cause I only got one night in town and I know that you down to bussdown

Bend it over, touch your toes, let me see that pussy hole
Now make it shake, make it pop, make it drop, make it roll
Bend it over, touch your toes, let me see that pussy hole

I got a main chick, a mistress and a young bitch
Plus a ho to suck off every nigga that I run with
Got that fire head, guaranteed to make you cum quick
Once I put that ho on a stroll, I'mma be dumb-rich
Son of a bitch, that nigga Freddie about to run to your chick
You shoulda knew that when she hit me with the number and shit
She had me all up in your bedroom, watching a flick
Now I got your wife enticed to hop on the dick
Cause I'm a pimp, not a gigolo
All about my figures though
Gotta think about your cashflow when you dick a ho
You can ride with me, but you gotta fuck my nigga though
Me and bro'll hit them in the studio

A nigga got yack by the fifth, got weed by the pound
So a groupie bitch is all a nigga need when I come around
Cause I only got one night in town
And I know that you down to bussdown

Yo, I could peep a little mama for a minute
And she thick with it, she need to go on, let a nigga hit it
Cause I only got one night in town and I know that you down to bussdown

// Iodine Poison //

Motherfucker Goddam
I'm blowed off in this motherfucker
Puffin chad back in the zone off in this motherfucker
Chopper go off and reload off in this motherfucker
NIgga might see something explode off in this motherfucker
Snapped up strapped to the teeth
Motherfuckers in A they dropped the yak in my Caprice
Let the moonlight hit the sky then I went yakkin up the street
Did an 85 and left them niggas wrapped up in a sheet
Motherfuckers know it's:
FG, I keep my money on my mind
Gorilla on the track and keep a swisha full of pine
A pack out on the strip and a bitch or two on the grind
Got niggas in my clique that'll kill you and do the time
So violate me baby and I bet you make the front page
Fuck my PO, I'm stayin blazed till the last age

Give me some kushy and some purple to sip
And let me check out on the sunset strip
Like a motherfucking pimp
Pimp C I keep my money on my mind

Bitch I'm too hard to swallow the son is super tight
Was raised on riding dirty, dirty money off the white
Kept a couple side hustles, thought rapping was just a dream
Later snapped on the track like I was an UnderGround King
Whatchu mean?
You bitches act like I'm fresh on the scene
Brought Canadian bud across the border at 17
Wholly moley dotey and that proper drug methazine
Come down to my basement and all you see is a sea of green
Bitch I'm on that grown shit
Had to grow my own shit
Got those P-zo's and those zippers hit me on the phone bitch
If you need it then I got it just don't say the wrong shit
Too much yappin at the trap'll send us on a long trip
Fuck polices and politicians perpetrating that punk shit
I'm coming down on candy paint like "smoke some bitch"

Give me some kushy and some purple to sip
And let me check out on the sunset strip
Like a motherfucking pimp
Pimp C I keep my money on my mind

// Just Tryin' Ta Make It //

Yeah, okay
Gangsta, Gangsta Gibbs, nigga
Yeah, I'm down
I got my back against the wall, ready to ride
Better livin' on my mind
See it in my eyes, I'm just tryin' to make it
Yeah, life at a hundred miles an hour, nigga

I live my life in the fastlane, hundred miles an hour
Anything for the cash, mane, marijuana to powder
Peep the style of a ghetto child runnin' wild
At the park, hydroponics gettin' sparked, steppin' over broken crack vials
It's like this way of livin' chose me
Police approaching me, this ain't the way I wanna be
This ain't how I wanna live
I dream about having kids, but I'm afraid
That as they grow they won't see they daddy live
'Cause daddy is problematic, daddy got bad habits
Hopefully when I'm older, I look back and I laugh at it
For now, I'ma deal with it
Get my heat and kill with it
I'm droppin' any nigga in the way of my meal ticket, I wonder why
In the ghetto, we really living to die
Hunger pains make you fiend for a slice of the devil's pie
But it gotta be a better way
Before I lay me down to sleep, I hit my knees and pray

"I'm doing good if I live to see another day"
That's what they say
People wonder why I live this way
But I'm just tryin' to make it
Yo, I'm just tryin' to make it
I got my back against the wall, ready to ride
Better livin' on my mind
You can see it in my eyes, I'm just tryin' to make it
Yo, I'm just tryin' to make it

My attitude is shady from the hood that made me
My parents said they worked so my grandmama raised me
And you know, eventually she got too tired to chase me
So I jumped up off the porch and hit the street runnin' crazy
Nickel-plated .380
I earthed a couple sacks and got my first piece
Ready to raise hell out on the streets
Some old head said: "Freddie, keep your mind on your grip
Ignore the bullshit and never get caught up for a bitch"
Pimpin' ain't easy but my granddaddy he showed me the ropes
My uncle had me packin' them pistols and hustlin' coke
This ain't a joke, the results of my love for the dollar, dollar
Got yo baby momma coppin' my product, it's Guatemalan
Fuck tomorrow, 'cause it ain't guaranteed
Show me the money, mothafucka
I got a family to feed, a life to live
Stuck between a rock and a hard spot
Another prisoner of the block

"I'm doing good if I live to see another day"
That's what they say
People wonder why I live this way
But I'm just tryin' to make it
I'm just tryin' to make it
I got my back against the wall, ready to ride
Better livin' on my mind, you can see it in my eyes
I'm just tryin' to make it
Yo, I'm just tryin' to make it
"I'm doing good if I live to see another day"
That's what they say
People wonder why I live this way
But I'm just tryin' to make it
Yo, I'm just tryin' to make it
I got my back against the wall, ready to ride
Better livin' on my mind, you can see it in my eyes
I'm just tryin' to make it
Yo, I'm just tryin' to make it

// One Mo' Time //

It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's strange, but, I can't complain you're in a better place
It ain't a question; I know you're resting in heaven
Ask God to let you listen to me for a second
There's some things that I wanted to say
Because for a while life wasn't going your way
Then the next thing I know you were gone for good
Caught up in the cycle that plagues the hood
First niggas move the salt, then comes the crack
Mill laid him off, the streets called him back
You always told me what drugs would do
That's why I still looked up to you when nobody trusted you
I saw my favorite hustler turn into a customer
It killed me like a bullet to the jugular
I wish I could have stopped the bullet that hit you

I miss you until the day I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you

I flame the Jane
And 16 bars ain't enough to explain the pain
I can drink a whole fifth
Burn a whole zip
When the high wears off the stress still exists
So, I get blitzed the whole day and never think twice
I'm guessing I should change my life
Don't wanna get caught slipping and easily get my wig splitted
In my city, at any given minute, you can get it
I done lost a lot of homies over dumb shit
That cousin [?] I ain't going out like no punk shit
Car accidents, terminal illness
Death is something you gotta deal with
Rest in peace to my homies; the lord called them home
Quay Shepard, Andrew Jones, and Little Ramon
You're gonna live through the kid
So, I'll never forget you

I miss you until the day I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you
One more time
That's all I need
Because it was never easy to let you go
I want you to know
I love you and I won't forget you
Miss you till I'm with you
