Will never let this industry demasculinize me (Nah)
I do murder barefaced, don't need no mask to disguise me
Threw my FN in the stash, I think the cracker's behind me, damn
He pulled me over, I asked him, "Yo, what's the problem, sir?
I swerved to ducked the potholes, man, I had no option, sir
Just let me go 'cause my license, insurance proper, sir
I'd hate to be on the run for smokin' an officer"
We were bustin' at police before Queen & Slim, that's on FN
Let off fifty shots to the squad car and get in the wind
Told the Gary Police in '05 that I got more guns than them
Get the feds if you want a war, and they sent them bitches in
The revolution is the genocide
Yeah, my execution might be televised
Cross niggas like Bubba Chuck, I never gave a fuck
Hook shot a ho like Kareem, but I never leave the Bucks
Sick with the ack, me and Jack, pourin' three liters up
It hurt to say I miss you, the real ones always be leavin' us
Caught up in the moment, most niggas foldin' or freezin' up
Sometimes it be your own damn homies, Judas set Jesus up
Yeah, the revolution is the genocide
Made a sex tape with your bitch, that pussy televised
Thug nigga with some exotic dreams, erotic dreams
Fuckin' hella thots, but I really want me a Scottie Beam
Shit was different when Mike left and it was Scottie team

Caprice, that is
Yo (M-M-Maybach Music)

You need a dictionary when you write your raps (Uh)
Went to the penitentiary just for a hundred sack (What?)

But they won't listen 'til you in your kitchen countin' cash
I got the dollars, motherfuck a nigga's credit score (Boss)
Big bag of chronic like I'm sackin' up at Interscope (at Interscope)
My pistol polished, any problems, I'ma pull that ho

Bitches lookin' at me, shawty wanna see my soul (M-M-M)
All my jewelry on, she only see my gold (Haha)
I'm prayin' for my guys, pray you sing along (Yes)
I fuck bitches in my ride, I never bring 'em home

He wanted war until they hit 'em with a cannonball (Bang)
Spark spliffs, raw kicks, I give 'em Clark Kent
Common sense, no Prince, strictly the mob hits (What? M-M)
Exhale weed, ship it from the West (West)
My brain begin to seize when I'm needin' rest (Yes)

Niggas stretch it and press it, we pushin' that
When I stop selling crack, I ain't lookin' back
Yeah, bitch, I ain't lookin' back
Yeah, damn

Came through in a new Porsche speed
Too much coke'll make a bitch nose bleed
To the floor seats from the nosebleeds, bitch, yeah

You luck you got away with just a scratch, sucker
What you got the other night was just the smoke
The fire is yet to come
Got to run him out of the neighborhood
What you'll get is nothing but a whole lot of trouble
You better be careful when you talk about shedding blood in this community

// Frank Lucas //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Might just spill over on you
Okay, I'm trying baby
Nigga, my name is cocaine
Yeah, uh, uh

You niggas snitchin' gettin' time shaved
Sold the book on my boost mobile, I boost the crime rate
Tellin' all my hoes that I love 'em, I'm playin' mind games
And bitches after your last dollar, they take your last name
I'm married to this shit, I jumped off the porch then I jumped the room
Bunny Rabbit gang, we be robbin' shit like like the Romper Room
Catch your Uber or lyzift, I sent the rezith
The feds wanna turn the witness, I plead the fizith
Been smokin' since 13, I fried my brain, so I ain't never stressin'
I can't hold no grudges, Michael Thomas, bitch, I'm catchin' blessings
Police tryna catch me, ain't gon' catch me ridin' without my weapon
Panoramic roof off of on that coupe, I look like George Jetson Space Ghost
Fentanyl, got a gas mask when I make dope
I done seen a lot of OG's at this table havin' you taste dope
I just got another case though, call me lawyer, hit him with the pesos
Gotta cook a bird where the J's stay, got a play play for the yayo
Been thuggin' since a youngin', I'm too legit to quit
I keep this bitch in like my kinship, bustin' shots at the bitch
I had the strap, she took the charge, I took that bitch on the trip
Flew in her friends, jumped on the boat, I fucked them both
Shit was lit, shit was lit
Pray my soul keep dead low or lay me down
The SWAT team might machine gun or grenade me down
And if they do tear my people, just hold my babies down
Nigga we need to go back the pages like it's the eighties now
Yeah, fuck rap, bitch, I'm poppin' off of poppy seed
My name cocaine ain't got put me in the nominees
Since gangsta gears rolled back the bars, I see a lot of me
Niggas is my sons, I wish they mommas would have swallowed these
Nigga, cappin' ass nigga
Jeezy used to say "Boy, you one rappin' ass nigga"
I said I'm shippin' packs, I don't need no advance, nigga
Niggas thought I took a loss, but I jumped off
And I got richer, shit is funny when you think about it
Rolex too big, I took a link up out it
Frank Lucas I hit the closet, pulled the mink up out it
Livin' this life, pussy dream about it, nigga

[Benny The Butcher:]
Bury me with ratchets, let the feds tell it, apparently a magnum
Gucci hoodie smell like kerosine and ashes
Don't get carried away, I been up and look how carefully I stack it
Got your advance check buried in the mattress
We the Yankees on the pennant run
You in need of soldiers, heard you rented some
Tellin' war stories and you ain't been in none
But look what I converted to from lettin' burners loose out convertibles
My bitch gon' be the driver for a purse or two
Nah, my finger never gon' point
You know pussy best when it's moist
Got a hammer and a brick from a plug I met in a joint
Miami, Superbowl weekend, I got head in a Royce
We chasin' cheddar of course, I wouldn't care if it's Deutsch
It was either law school or dog food
If I was makin' y'all moves, we all lose
Make these sucker niggas pay, those was our rules
You gon' need more guns and lucky horse shoes
I never took an L, but a few loss to mind
New loft down town and this view was hard to find
Sold lines to abusers, now I'ma abuse y'all with lines
I'm in this black thing, he ain't just a few cars behind
I bought two of everything, they said "dude lost his mind"
Two gold Cubans, like I'm tryin' too hard to shine
Two whips, one a coupe that's too small to drive
Two-car garage, two broad massage, yeah
Niggas think I be frontin'
But I just be talkin' that real shit
I don't expect anybody to feel it though
'Cause y'all niggas not like that (Nobody talk that shit like I talk that shit nigga, let's go)
With this .9 I got from the district, I'm shoppin' for Christian

She don't like it, bitch can punch out, niggas be changin' shifts, yeah
You niggas bringin' out the old me (Old me)
I'm tryna live to ninety-three and see the old me
When I touched that crack, I let them crackers take control of me
Serve the piece, caprice, ain't got no heat, man, it was cold G
Record labels downed me forty thousand on my first advance
Fucked up on my taxes, IRS kept me on payment plans
Crime fuckin' pays, but once you paid, you gotta pay the man
Straight survival, right hand on the Bible, I won't take the stand, yeah
VL niggas trap it out
Lord let me hit this ho, so I have something to rap about
Been through shit with hoes that I look back and I can laugh about
This shit wasn't no joke, sittin' in that cage, this shit was draggin' out
Diego trippin' cause I'm sittin', ain't no package out
You robbed the plug, kicked in the door and cleaned the mattress out
Right back in the trap, these niggas bringin' out the old me
I'm tryna live to ninety-three to see the old me

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo
Nail is in the coffin, Freddie sent me this shit
This sound like the boat I haven't bought yet
This sound like the moment I jump off it
Sun shinin', cold water, feelin' in my pocket
This lake water better than the faucet I grew up with
We hold our breath like grudges 'til we nauseous
We hop out, let the sun dry us, like raisins
We get dressed in some Gucci or Lacoste, shit it's amazing
We look like Polo ads but skin is dark and-
I gotta move cautious, 'cause niggas malicious, they come from the trenches
I used to be a Goblin under them bridges, now I'm up in this man
I started gettin' mula as young and now I got bigger hands
To hold them, if I got too much on me, I know my niggas can
I keep my circle tight like tops, nothin' corn, no crops
You messy and get cleaned up with the mop
I went to school and I ain't miss it a lot
So I can be around niggas like you and learn how to keep my distance
I, cut some niggas off on some hater shit niggas said to me
R.I.P. T's 'cause these motherfuckers is dead to me
Nail is in the coffin murder, murder
I'm sick of y'all niggas and I ain't coughin', I know me
Y'all often anxious, lost in y'all thoughts and I don't relate
So keep that energy away from me
Don't blame me, 'cause you ain't got it figured out
You ain't got the bigger house, the jig is up
You jealous dawg, my afro long, I'll pick it out
Like cotton on some basic, shit is off
We ain't adjacent
I'm grounded like the pavement, we ain't linkin' like the bracelet broke
Better get your wrist that hold, on that thought, you gettin' gold
The fuck away, 'cause niggas'll get they faces broke
I just got a thumbs up and niggas go like "Good job"
You better find a shoe store and get your sole
Get it quick and slip it on
And I'll be in Mykonos, lemonade, sippin' slow
Jumpin' in the water off that boat I haven't bought yet (Bitch)

One take
Let me hear that
I meant to say Mykonos (haha)

I think a thing is dying from alcohol but I'm afraid
But if you write dope shit, it doesn't do any good what you die
It is to teach these parents to be civilized people, becau-
