Album: Fortitude

// Born For One Thing //

Mortal, spawn on the altar
Caught in the heart of the blaze
The primal fear of disappearing
Becoming
A ghost in the void

Death

Give a price, put a name
None of it real in this matter
Wandering, distracting
Wishing the life of another
Self

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all

We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're all drawn into ourselves
In a collective coma

Remember, gazing up for answers
But now we're staring down

Down
Down
Down

All is blur in the maze, we put an end to all

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all

We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're no one
United
When we're gone

// Amazonia //

Incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
You rotate the frame in a world you rely on
A scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
Behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush

The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground

Onto the next stage of the plan
Mourn the witness of the wind
A handful of thunder
Will rise one last time

There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground

Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia

Burn the land
Learn the end

Burn
Another gold mine is unveiled
The source of our sorrow
Learn
Embedded in these walls of green
Is the curse that we follow

There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground

// Another World //

We mock and slaughter all the purest kinds
Blinded by the noise and maze, this flash in our eyes
Hope for the world but prepare for the worst
I'd rather find a way on my own

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me

Don't believe your lies, don't believe your tales
I'm longing for the day I will find...

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me

// Hold On //

I've been grinding and grinding
O! Ocean have mercy

I've been grinding and grinding
O! Ocean have mercy
I give you my life
O! Son of the Sun

I've been rowing and rowing
No sign of land so far in the flood
I've been through fire and wind I'm hanging, feet in the depth

Drowning all day long, in an ocean of stress
Gotta find a safety raAAAAAAft, another wave is striking down

Hold on! Fight!
We are are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

In a matter of time, you're out in the open
You shall prove yourself in the bitter end
But for now, brace yourself!

Hold on! Fight!
We are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

When you witness death you understand your demise
And you may embrace your destiny the fate of all
And maybe when we die we rise, high, find a ground
And we return where we belong

Elders, deep under
Shelter, land!

Fight!
We are merely grabbing on to life
Fight!
One last attempt to break the code...

Hold on! Fight!
We are are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

Hold on! Fight!
Hold on tight!
Hold on! Fight!
Hold on tight!

// New Found //

Long lost illusions, left a hole
You're filling the pond, a specter of the past
A pale light is keeping you awake
And dragging your skull, a pointless ritual

Make things right, straighten up the lies
You've been telling yourself all along
Look straight up it's right in front of you
A vision through the reeds, a reason to go on

New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea

The long days you've had, enough to figure out
What it is you dig and what you're bleeding for
A bright light, now making you alive
Connecting the dots, a brand new ritual

New found vision through the veil
New found colors for the blind
New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea

New found vision through the veil
New found colors for the blind
New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea

New found
New found
New found
New found

We're all on the same boat, we're going down
We're all on the same boat, we're going high

// The Chant //

You were told to swallow, crawl and hide
Victims of fear and deception
Get ahold of yourself, rise above
The better part of you, immortal

May this purple spring flow into your soul
Exhausting all these black holes inside
Wake up to the sound of doom!
Let this chant ring in your bones and lift you up

Get strong
Get strong
Get strong
Get strong

Leave the mud behind and climb up the sky
Wake up to the sound of doom!
Leave the mud behind and climb up the sky
Wake up to the sound of doom!
Leave the mud behind and climb up the sky
Wake up, wake up
Leave the mud behind and climb up the sky
Wake up to the sound of doom!
Leave the mud behind and climb up the sky
Wake up to the sound of doom!

// Sphinx //

Call upon the wise one to remember the chords
The truth buried alive since the dawn of time
Was it all for nothing? Great watcher of the soul
Rid the world of its blindfold, make us real again!

Carved in lime stone

That's all there is, facing the lion
Become one
You stand still, the voice of silence
Remain one

Express your will, you will be rewarded
For all thoughts become reality
May we learn from the old one
Standing tall in the sand
Witness erosion, the rise and fall of men

Carved in lime stone

That's all there is, facing the lion
Become one
You stand still, the voice of silence
Remain one

Become one

The savior has arrived
The savior has a name

Carved in lime stone
You become one
Facing the lion
You become one

// Into The Storm //

Go!

Say something about awakening
The rebellion you felt before
Wake, change your course, laws will follow
Restart, reactivate the core

Rise!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Strength!
Gather your strength, raise your eyes
Fear not the demons you're up against

Now that you dove down
Found the bottom, begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Flames!
Dancing in the open
You step into the light
You step into the light

Now that you dove down
Found the bottom, begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Storm!
Into the storm
Storm!

// The Trails //

All that you see that is gold is truly gold
I spotted through the vines, a deer in the wild

Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason

Eye-gazing the unknown, defeating the ground
This passage through the flames, leads me where the souls go

Signs in the dreams
Beyond the reason
We're forced into the light

How can we be so blind?
Our light is torn
How can we be so lame?
No truth being told

Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason

All that you see that lives truly is alive
Let us stay awake reminded of the trails that matter

// Grind //

Surrender to the grind
Embrace the laws that make you cringe
You will be fixed in no time
If you go all the way

Grind!
Grind!

We're wandering in chaos
Forget about which reality is real
Eternal quest to resolve
Our struggle with gravity

You're all shredded, you're all scarred
Fighting the tide
Your tough face on, you think you'll last long
Against the grain?

Go!
Surrender to the grind
Obey!
Surrender to the grind

The only way
Grind!
Grind!
Grind!
