// Beautiful Pussy //

I can turn a God to man
I can turn a brick, to a band
I can turn a house to a hen
I can put your girl on plan
... Trips to japan
I can watch Akira with your girl
I can put my hand on her curves
I can run the game on the bird
I can never put shame on my word
I can't give you the world

I can make a mountain, from a rainbow
I can get a perfect score in Halo
I can do the thing though
Work it from you body to your ankles
But I can never give you all my bankroll
Cause baby who are you?

She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy
(My girl, My girl, My girl)
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy

I can turn a man to a bitch
I can turn a hoe to a snitch
I can turn band to a brick
I can put the gun to your dome
I put the holes in the chrome
Fuck with me...
I heard they looking for your boy
I just hope they find em
Cause a nigga, ain't employed
Hiding in the church
I'm blending in nicely
Cause I'm a not a black pope
The pope is a white me, nigga

I can turn a man from a slob
I can turn a girl to a God
I can work the middle
Oh I promise
Baby I'm so honest
Hunt you until I fucking make a profit
Cause baby where are you...

She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy
(I know, I know, I know)
She's got the most beautiful pussy
She's got the most beautiful pussy

I never seen it real good
Just a quick glimpse
When she's over my house
And she's trying on clothes

// Cops Are The Target Interlude //

5 am, friday morning
Thursday night, far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live
Got a full tank and some chips

It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang "holy holy"
As he buttoned down his pants

You can laugh, it's kind of funny
Things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
