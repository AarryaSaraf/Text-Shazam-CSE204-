Album: OnceMoreRoundTheSun

// Tread Lightly //

Through the ages,
All the weary and the blind
Facing the unknown.

Off the venom.
Center our lives,
Knowing not your own is unwise.

And I will return for more.
The light will lead you ashore.

Paralyzed by thorn, inside

To the angel,
Breathing on me from the right,
A guilt you'll never know.

From the devil,
Staring from the left-hand side,
Souls to animal.

Recede your eyes.
Sulk in disgust.
When there is doubt,
Look to the obvious.

And I'll decide what you will pay.
Changing your mind seals our fate.

Paralyzed by thorn, inside.

Open your eyes!
Take a deep breath and return to life!
Wake up and fight!
Fight for the love and the burning light!

// The Motherload //

I can see what the world has done to you.
I can feel the weight,
Feel the weight.
I can see what this life has handed you.
I can feel the weight,
Feel the weight.

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let you slip away.
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let you leave this way.

If you want it, you can will it.
You can have it!
I can put it right there in your hands!

I can hear what the spirits are telling you.
I can clear the weight,
Clear the weight.
I can see all the wolves as they circle you.
I can crush the weight,
Crush the weight.

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let you slip away.
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let you leave this way.

If you want it, you can will it.
You can have it!
I can put it right there in your hands!

This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let slip away.
This time, this time
Things'll work out just fine.
We won't let you leave this way.

If you want you want it, you can will it.
You can have it!
I'll put it right there in your hands!

// High Road //

You let the wind take us down
You let the storm come and wipe us out
I saw the fox stomp you out
I saw the ocean come take you under

I have my bullet stuck in your mouth
I have you screaming for your last breath, yeah
I shoved the boat deep inside
I still waiting for the devour

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below

You are the one nobody likes
You are the plague that was brought here by rats
I like to hunt you, lets fight
Watching you fade out and never come back

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below

You take the high road down
I take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I take the ground below

// Once More 'Round The Sun //

I'm a man and that's who I am
and I'll tell you that to your face
I'm from the clouds and I shine like the moon
and I'm here to fuck up the place

Make it last, make it count
make it one more round and I'll see you outside
heaven knows life can turn on a dime
so let's enjoy our time

They have got me hanging upside down again
once more 'round the sun we go again

What's the meaning of this life
that we leave when we're caught up on the race
my heart is spinning like a merry-go-round
and I want you to take a ride

I know it's nice and I know that you are weary
but it's nice once you step inside
roll me over and turn me around
and let's make up on time

They have got me hanging upside down again
I just want to melt into the sun
once more 'round the sun we go again

They have got me hanging upside down again
I just want to melt into the sun again
they have got me hanging upside down again
once more 'round the sun we go again

// Chimes At Midnight //

I saw the mountain crumble down
I saw colossus in flames.
I heard the ocean draining
Nothing that I could ever tame.

Off with my head, come down the line
I have the right to decide.
I'll bring this light, as is the sky
Altered minds they criticize.

Unrest within your flesh
How can we stop this pollution?

Altering trouble, you cannot fix
Envy of others never makes me rich.
All my heroes, they're all dead
As I remain here inside my

We have heard the chimes at midnight.
Into the void I go.
Will I ever see your face again
Or will black be all I know

Arriving inside
Our hearts alive

And the darkness here is grim
But it found us, surrounded.
Lead me deep into the canyon
You put your guidance in the wrong hands.

Feet ungrounded, giving your best
Now take your gold into silence.
You take a stand, bracing yourself
For this cold is never ending.

We have heard the chimes at midnight.
Into the void I go.
Will I ever see your face again
Or will black be all I know

Arriving inside
Our hearts alive

// Asleep In The Deep //

The moment you walked in the room, my friend
the demons, they all went away
be careful, they're only asleep for a while
pretending there's nothing to say

Throw salt in all the corners here
make sure you watch him leave

Build up the walls around this house
and dig out the rot in the floor
block out the entrance with brick and stone
and mortar that's made from coal

Crawl into this hole I've made
transform these feelings of fear

I'm on fire
say you'll remember her voice
and I can't get you out of my mind

Loose lips have fallen on deaf ears
loose lips have fallen on blind eyes

An ocean of sorrow surrounds this home
I hope that we make it to shore
as time chips away at the fortress walls
it seems that we weathered the storm

The sun begins to show itself
revealing victory

I'm on fire
say you'll remember her voice
and I can't get you out of my mind

// Feast Your Eyes //

You call for reason
it turns me inside out
there's no direction
no ebb and flow
you call them rejects
they're all I have
the mills of life
they will grind you down

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flowing

I see a vision
chew it with my teeth
believe the dying
and minds that read
a change in season
your mind crawls back
turning neurotic
a self-attack

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flow

This beast is vicious
turns your pale face green
and keep the search on for mystery
you told a secret
confide into the trees
thinking you know a man's history

See the red
all I know is
see the red
watch it flow

Fall into pieces, I swear we're done
you stick with me and prevail as one

// Aunt Lisa //

I don't see the fearsome fright
all I see is beauty shine
not much time to say goodnight
I can hear you scream in the sky

Nephew do you feel all right
always up in overdrive
they would try to smother you
never let your feelings through

Live out loud

I'm sniffing your garden
I'm sniffing your rose
she's stuck in the middle
you know how it goes

They're crawling across now
they'll give him some blow
we'll do him a favor
we'll give him some gold

I remember your eyes came out
I can see you run and shout
don't know where to place the blame
you knew how to hide your pain

We just want to see you alive
taught me how to speak my mind
release you in atmosphere
it was just too small in here

Live out loud

Hey ho, let's fucking go
hey ho, let's get up and rock n' roll

// Ember City //

You walk with boundless grace
think old thoughts from yesterday
all being lost in the fire
you wandered and lost the way
someone's always left behind
when the door of life closes

And you were slipping away
what do I say to you
and if I want you to stay
what do I say to you

This moment I take for you
think of all we didn't do
all seeking answers from this
hope to come out alive
standing still my hands are tied
our eyes open up to the sky

And you were slipping away
what do I say to you
and if I want you to stay
what do I say to you

// Halloween //

Orange and black take me back to Halloween
I've given to the blind as you can see
gasoline runs thru my veins
so don't you mess with me
I couldn't tame that beast with a handful of meat

Just wait till my robe falls at my feet
cold and dilated like my memories
strange voices in my head
who could they be
it's the master of disguise and he's breaking me

You will find spirits never rise
without warning
feel your fate as you come alive
they're here to take you home

Crashing through the walls
you're the one I want to see
bent all up on a moon-soaked night
death is riding with me

Dripping blood with hell froze at my feet
use a razor blade to cut some lines
Because now I'm going to speed

You will find spirits never rise
without warning
feel your fate as you come alive
they're here to take you

// Diamond In The Witch House //

Wide is the line
separates the rivers from the dirt
all the while I wonder who's the one

Within the one and only eye
we all stood cut free
self-blinded to see through the veil

Can you see there's a child
standing idle by us in this mess
who am I to cause this emptiness

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
of all that I've been
to bring me free to this clarity

Trouble rolls in
as the tides, they twist and make the turn
pain subsides
and sweeps across the earth again

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
of all that I've been
to bring me free to this clarity

Within the one and only eye
we all stood cut free
self-blinded to see through the veil

I'm standing deep in these waters
bleeding free and bent
to drag us onto the new visions
only loss fills my void

Only the void connects me
with these mountains
of dust, blood and soil
the stones born in the flames of truth
demand a sacrifice

Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves
we will return so deeply harmed
and we will shatter you
