// Alice //

When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(Deceived me) You deceive me

(With you) Erase it I will not

(to stay) Finishing a halo (didn't he know alice?)

(I will plead) I will not excuse you

(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
would share,
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
who shall
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
replace
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
You

When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo 
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(pushing me) Look she fell
(with you) Right there on the floor
(so you) Finishing with her life
(not me) It hasn't even started

// Because Of Whirl-Jack //

Fly, won't you fly?
It comes overreaching
It's that whirly-gig
It's also for jack...

Whoever comes clean or a hullaballoo
For whip-stitching
Please won't you fly?

Please won't you, please won't you, please won't you fly?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?

Fulfillment
Creativity

It may be diverting
For some part of him

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Naming things is empowering
I balance, walk, and coordinate myself, alive
Aliveness energy

Healthy dependence
And healthy independence
And healthy assurances
This love's a nameless dream
And healthy boundaries
And how long would you miss me

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?

Come from ascending sea.

Land in places so dry.

Long, and I long.

// Flock Of Soul //

Whispers she softly, sweet songs in the bed of dreams:
No answer, sweet song light
Sing? I'd love to
to sunlight, a song in the bed of dreams
Cover me in Sublime light, with tingles
Sing, and touch me
With sad lust and revealing dreams
Your song light will touch me

Sing nice body, passing through and over me
So find me, come and answer me 
We find it deep, this, my minute, friend 
Not long before the wisps of starlight,
meet the sunrise thru the window (shining)
From outside, come in to toss me.
Come back now, to find the sunlight.

Come back now, put sunlight on, oh
Be with me and dream, it's my minute, friend
Come feel the deep
It's love in a floodlight
Come feel the deep
It's love in a flood

Ahhhh ahhhh oohhhh
Ooohhh ahhh ahhhhh

Sing and touch light, satisfying me
The sunlight will touch me
Sing as from me, pass it over me, sublime me and I'll... come back to you.

// Frosty The Snowman //

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop
He only paused a moment when he heard them holler 'Stop!'

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

// Golden-Vein //

Shunning punched
All of song
Will you spare
Last night, till dawn
Your eyes have mine
At last I've got lyric

The rest into
A mood of dust
Myself into
With eyes for me
My safe love
Bought

Showing emotions
New rules
Reaching out
Realing with it
Our mountain roses
Oh in their eyes and then

Little flowers in the dirt
And gladness will fill me in your hand
You hold and surround me in gold
Myself into
It finds a thread

// Ice-Pulse //

I am inauthentic
That's me not knowing who he is
I feel understands me
You don't love me
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
He mocks
Before me
I could have done something differently
You can't heal what you can't feel
Half beyond the consequence and
Hurt me must grieve 
Let betrayal in this
Also I'd leave our dreams
And best beyond chance
What might have been
I embrace my feelings
Share them lonely
Last the only may are these food
I take heart
Because I haven't reacted
To create hurt
You can't heal what you can't feel

// Kookaburra //

To a girl who you mind
A starry sky memory
When Eros spurns Rococo
Rouge thus far 

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

There is no end
Ca candle blown, she'll doubt
Faced with past losing 

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

And you my god
Can't give show
Can't give
Til you go dancing
Forgive my love
Ca candle blown
she will not

And you my god
Can't give show 
Can't give
Til you go dancing

She's spark run away for you
Do you know what we call the moon

So she'll decide
To marry can we come to be

// Mud And Dark //

Echo fell in love with the handsome Narcissus
Narcissus saw nymphs who adored him
And wasn't ever raised to their affection

"Is anyone here?" 
"Here here!" 
"Come!"
"Come!" 
"I will die before I give you power over me!"
"I give you power over me!"

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

Naricissus leaned over a clear pool
For a drink and fell hoplessly
In love with his own reflected image

Cursed through thought of futile desire to have his own affection
In turn Narcissis slowly wasted away
And didn't continue to love me

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

And death, eventually, overtook him as he stared
He's found a finger for you; "Why would you be so mean?"
And she repeated these same words to him

And Echos fleshes all were scattered about
And her bones turned to stone
Today, all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves

"Is anyone here?" 
"Here, here!"
"Come!"
"Come!"
"I will die, before I give you power over me!"
"I give you power over me."

// Pink Orange Red //

He draws his horses
Pretend your anger
And draws his horses
Being chosen also

Please get up
Fall, please get up
Fall, please get up
Don't ruin yourself

So see and hear
Sultitan itan
So see and hear
Plain tiger iger

In my heart
Set you right up
In my heart
I sing this song

Back you up
How messed I am
Back you up
I consider

So he got up
I must see him
I must see him
And all got up

Sore got he
Apalled got up
Apalled got up
I'm in this song

So see and hear
Sultitan itan
So see and hear
Plain tiger iger

// Primitive Heart //

Though the soul must convey 
Some more tears to delete
He is there to your death
Burning as alcohol

Must so live, flower of love
So's psyche in staged
Dialectics

Sneaking out, suitcase shown
Lover must have a man
To quiz of making man
This joy, pain on her heart

Smooth things frame till sugared
Midnight he'll sing blue
Cuz he's silly

What woman can sing
Without loving the primitive heart

Heart, heart
Loving the primitive heart
Strain, strain
Clouding yourself by seeing strain

I, I will stay focused
When the thoughts do land
It's positive reinforcement
This sense of movement
This place, enjoy it

It gives me a new sense of progress
Tells me I've got capacity to improve
Yes, I will stay focused
When the thoughts do land
This place, enjoy it

Long-term scares us when we're down...
I really need to know if you are in love...

Choose your way of life
Choose your way of life, Damon

It's your life, it's your
It's your life, it's your

Choose your way of life
Choose your way of life, Damon

// Winter Wonderland //

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say,  "are you married?"
We'll say, "no man",
"But you can do the job when you're in town!"

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
