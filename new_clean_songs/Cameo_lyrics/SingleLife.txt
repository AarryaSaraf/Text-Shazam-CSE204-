// Attack Me With Your Love //

Attack me with your love, baby

Hey...

When you walk, when you pass me by
There's reasons that come immediately to mind
One is I'd like to have you, two is I love your face
The third one is irrelevant 'cause there's no time or place

Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby (Attack me with your love)
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby
(And I'll do all the things you want me to)

Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby

I think you need to know the deal about just how I really feel
'Cause intentionally I'm for real and I'm sure I'll make you feel
That I'm a mean man and I'm a go-getter (Ow)
Hey, baby, baby

Late at night when the evening comes
I sit down to check my options, there are none
First thing I think about is your lovely smile
And the things that drive me wild (Uh)

Got a little lady drivin' me crazy
What am I gonna do, woo-hoo
Got a little lady drivin' me crazy
What am I gonna do if I can't have you

Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby
(And I'll do all the things you want me to)

Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby (Oh)
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby

Hey, pretty lady (Lady)
There's no defense against your love
I wanna show you how I feel
Hey, baby (Oh), baby

The night is young, here take this glass
We'll toast to happiness and a love that'll ever last
Of all the loves I've had before
No one can compare, to me you're so much more (Uh)

Baby, just let me do (Hey) what I wanna do to you
I know I'll have you, woo-ooh
If you can let me know what I wanna do to you
Then I'll wait for you (I'll wait for you), I'll wait for you

Attack
Attack, baby
Attack
Bushwhack, baby

Excite
Entice, baby
Come slap me
I'm happy, baby

// Single Life //

Every little thing you do
Makes me smile
And if I had my way, baby
I'd tie you up for a while

I'd take you through the paces
One by one
I don't wanna get too serious
I just like having fun

Yeah, yeah
I just like having fun
Oh, sugar

I'm living the single, single, single
Life
The single, single, single
Life

Now I don't want anybody
To get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see

Just like a car I'll drive you
Out of your mind
It's always the first step
In us having a good time

Oh, oh, oh, sugar

I'm living the single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life

Single guys clap your hands
Yeah
Oh, sugar
Single ladies clap your hands

Feels so good
And it feels so good
Feels so good

I'm living the single, single, single
Life (Oh, sugar)
Single, single, single
Life

Single, single, single
Life
Single, single, single
Life

Single, single, single
Single, single, single

// A Good-Bye //

Ahhhhh, ahhhhhh...ahhhhhh.
Ahhhhh, ahhhhhh...ahhhhhh.
I don't know, if I'll see you again...another journey, about to begin.
...yeahhh.
You use the powers of your mind, to lead me from the dark side of your limits...
the intuition that I had, to tell the good things from the bad, was no good for me.
A goodbye, is just a device...to bring you back to me.
...and I know, way down in my soul, that you'll come back to me.
I see you on the corner, in your blue faded jeans...talking to your friends, Bobby Joe n' Billy Jean.
Yeahhh, (yeahhh).
...and as I look into your eyes, there's that look that says goodbye.
Please don't hurt me.
...(hurt).
...and as I get closer and closer, something tells me that it's over.
My mind says forget it, but my heart won't let me quit it.
...just a smile, will hold me awhile, please take advantage of me.
Whoa oh oh...oh.
All this time, you've stayed on my mind...(stayed on my mind, you've stayed on my mind).
A goodbye, is just device...to bring you back to me.
...you and me, used to be the best friends.
Neither one of us knew, it would be like this in the end.
Sometimes things turn around, get you down...and that's when you need the hand of a friend.
...and I know it's not your fashion, but please show a little compassion.
I'll never forget it, and you know we won't regret it.
...show a sign, and I'll wait for all time.
You know it's perfect to me.
...words at night, and words make things right, please hon come back to me.
A goodbye, is just device...to bring you back to me.
A goodbye, is just device...to bring you back to me.

// I'll Never Look For Love //

[Male Lead:]
Thank you love for caring all this time
For every passing moment along the line
I use to take this kind of love for granted, how I was wrong
and now that I've been all around I've come back to you

[Chorus:]
And I'll never, ever look, look for love outside OUR DOOR
Here's the love we've waited for, what's in the past will be no more
I'm FOR you

[Female Lead:]
let me hold you sweetheart just this time
To remind us of what we mean to each other
How can we let go when this is the only love we'll ever, ever want to know
People say all things change, but our love will never say the same.....

[Chorus along with lots of Female ad lib]

Outside ooooh oooooh oooooh
Let me hold you for this moment woah, woah, woah
Here's the love we've waited for, what's in the past will be no more
I..I..I..I..I..I..I..I..lovvve you
I-I-I really dooooo
[Fade]
