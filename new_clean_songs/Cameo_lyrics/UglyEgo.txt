// I'll Be With You //

If you see what you want
You can get it
To philosophize and prophesy
Won't get it, no
I'll stay with you
Till I can't take it no more
And if I see these things won't change
I'll be walking out that door
But in the meantime

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you

You complain when I go out with all my friends
Tell me when do you think this foolishness will end
I never thought things could always be this bad
But two years is enough to tell me I've been had

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you

// Insane //

I feel you comin', just surroundin' me
I'll try to fight it, just you wait and see
'Cause when you come around you take me off into space
Oh, I get excited and I start to go insane

Insane, take my feet up off the ground
Insane, every time you come around
Help me, help me, why don't you help me out?
Insane

Uh, I saw three women just the other day
I snuck up real close to hear what they had to say
Ah, they said that Rudolph Valentino's the best lover in town
And when I need him most, he ain't around

Ah, hey fellas, yes, I need some more support
'Cause when she do me like she do, I wind up in a rut
Ah, and that rut you see makes livin' hard for me
If this goes on much longer I'll lose my identity

Insane, take my feet up off the ground
Insane, every time you come around
Insane, yeah, yeah
Insane

Now, if you would think the sound of my voice
I want you to go like this
1, 2, 3, uh

Insane
Insane
Uh

Insane
Insane
Insane

Insane
Insane
Uh

Insane

// Give Love A Chance //

Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance

I've walked a thousand miles
Met a lot of people, all races and all kinds
Love, love has no color, no
Well if you see a color, isit black, red, green or brown?

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Love will love you
If you give love a chance

Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance

You try to tell me I'm a fool
Feeling the way I do
But for me there's no other way
Consider love as a flower
That grows more every hour
Every minute of every day

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Take a step to accept
Just give your love a chance
Give your love a chance
Give your love a chance

Come on, make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Love will love you
If you give love a chance

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Take a step to accept
Just give your love a chance
Give your love a chance

Love has no color, no color...
I want you to to tell me, tell me...

// I Want You //

I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too, yeah

I want you to hug and hold
Be my woman every step of the way
Cause my emotions get real funky
And you can only cool me out that way
Now I don't want to have you
Just any way you want to give
Cause I'm a mean mother
and I can't be no other
and I'm gonna give all I can give

I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too, yeah

I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too

// Ugly Ego //

Searching
Looking to the sky
We've got our heads up high
We're doing fine
Laughing
With no intent to cry
We'll keep on stepping by
We're doing fine

Talkin' 'bout that weird feeling
Seeping into my brain
There's nothing to tell you
But it's never gonna be the same
Said that you can feel it
If you do like I do
Just don't let that ugly ego
Get the best of you

Can't turn back
You've got to leave that world behind
Don't you know
You know it's a fact now

Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly

Can't turn back
You've got to leave that world behind
Don't you know
You know it's a fact now

Do it!

Are you open
Are you open, tell me are you open
Are you open
Are you open, tell me are you open

Forget that ugly ego
Ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Ugly ego

// Anything You Wanna Do //

Anything you wanna do you can do it
If you just put your mind to it
The light that guides will take its time
So just keep on sticking to it

You shouldn't give a care about tomorrow
All that's there is there - yeah
Sometimes the past was full of sorrow
But the past for sure won't get us anywhere

You can be sure that you're receiving
The best life has to offer everyday, hey
What will be will be what you want it to be
It's you who controls your destiny, hey

// Friend To Me //

I've peeped through open doors
Looked here and there and then some more
Who else can it be
When you're sure you've tried it all and all

Did you ever know
That you'd find a friend
And did you ever dream
He would be with you thick and thin
Catch me if I fall
We've nothing to fear at all
Oh cause we have made it grow
And we've learned what there is to know

If you let it be - so unselfishly
You'll be a friend to me
When your heart's full of love
There's a well you're giving of
It's yours for free
It has no end

Did you ever know
That you'd find a friend, find a friend yeah
And did you ever dream, yeah dream
He would be with you thick and thin
Hey catch me if I fall
Cause we've nothing to fear at all
Cause we have made it grow, yes we did
And we've learned what there is to know
Yeah

If you let it be - unselfishly
A friend to me
When your heart's full of love
There's a well you're giving of
It's yours for free, yours for free

// Two Of Us //

How many times have you looked outside
Sun shining bright
And you thought to yourself
Hey! Lovely lovely day

Well that happy day will be no more
Cause some of us are hungry and even more poor
You've got to get involved, get involved
The almighty is there to see, yeah

You've got company -
You've got to help one another
Cause we're all one
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's with us every day
With us in every way

How many times have you looked around
And found someone in need
Then you pushed them aside, pushed them aside
Considering yourself a fair person indeed

You see the news, it's no good news
The less fortunate people are still paying dues
Come on and stand up straight
The suffering won't wait
There's only one world for us to share
Yeah

He's with us every day in every way
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us

He's watching, yeah
He's watching
He's watching
He's watching
