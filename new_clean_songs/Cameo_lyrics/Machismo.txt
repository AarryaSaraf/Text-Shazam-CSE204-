// You Make Me Work //

Well I've been losin' my mind
And bustin' my behind
Trying to get you, girl.
And I've been working so hard
I feel like you deserve a check
And I'm made of passion, girl.
You know I'm really glad to meet you
When you're always sweeter
When you bust my drops
'cause you will work a man so hard
He'll drop down to his knees
I'm beggin' you baby baby please

You make me work all night
All night even in between
Why do you make me work all night?
But you never let up it seems

Now I work a hard job
Eight hours preachin' everyday
(work work)
So when I come over to see you
You know you can't treat me this way, no
I'm hung up and stressed out
Don't know what time it is
That's why I need you invested
In love that won't be bringing you tears
For years and years, that's why

You make me work all day
Overtime, even on my time
Why do you make me work?
I know you're nervous
But I can't keep everything
No, no, no, no, no

(You make me work hard)
I and I'm coming to get your love
It's hardly nine o'clock
(You make me work hard)
Oh baby, yeah

You make me work hard baby
To get your love (you prove me wrong)
You make me work hard baby
You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby

Why do you make me work?
I work my behind off
I can't let you set me off
Why do you make me work?
I can't spend my time
Now I'm here about what's mine
Why do you make me work?
Make me work all night
Why do you make me work?
You treat me right

And I'm coming to get your love
Get your love, get your love
(you make me work hard)
Make minimum wage, baby!

You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby
You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby

I got to work real hard even though
I do work even harder
To get problems solved you're too much
Watch your break it's the man in
Oh, my, my. I'm on my job
Work, work, work, work, work

// Skin I'm In //

Who's this face in the mirror that I see
Sometimes confused by the double standards of society
And maybe I'm wrong about the way I feel
But then will somebody tell me what is really real

Now I respect myself
I respect you too, but in the end it's got to be
Do unto me as I do to you
Now I try to tell you it's time
Separate our wants from our desire
Separate the truth from the lie 
To live like people so inspired.

Peaceful world just out to see,
Basic respect, humanity,
And it one time seemed to be.
We can live together peacefully.
If we have truth we can survive
And for that our forefathers have died
It should be immoral or a sin
If it is according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in

Tell me how many times, how many times can I
Adjust my attitude to reach & touch the sky
Basic love is the creed by which I live
But then sometimes I wonder just how much a man can give
Gross injustices surround me from the highest levels of power 
And you say these are the people I depend on for my survival 
Is it for real or am I seeing shadows in the dark
I'll let you tell me, can u tell me brother
Tell me now

Peaceful world just out to see,
Basic respect humanity
I'm just trying to be realistic without becoming pessimistic
If we have hope we can survive
A damn good reason to stay alive
Is it immoral or a sin
It seems to be according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in

Peaceful world just out to see,
Basic respect humanity
I'm just trying to be for real in a world with less appeal
I'm so frustrated and flustered at what has been reduced to justice.
It is immoral or a sin
If it is according to the skin I'm in
Skin I'm in

One world, One Love, One people.
