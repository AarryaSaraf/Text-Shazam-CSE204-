// Somebody To Love //

For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, "It's time to sink or swim."
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody

Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

And you can have it all
Anything you want, I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find
Cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh oh, find me somebody to love, oh

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I need somebody, I need somebody to love
Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love

// Stuck In The Moment //

With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah

// U Smile //

I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get any less than you should

'Cause baby
You smile, I smile, oh
'Cause whenever you smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say, hey
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away

When you smile, I smile
Oh whoa
You smile, I smile, hey

Baby, take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

'Cause baby, you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby

Baby, you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
'Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish 'cause it's my command, hey hey hey

You smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh

You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

// Runaway Love //

You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going, I swear, nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

See, my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Why can't I find you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?
Yeah, yeah

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

// Never Let You Go //

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that it's meant to be
Cause baby, when you're with me

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so

Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl, I'm here
If you didn't know, this is love

Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here, right here (I'll never let you go)
Don't shed a tear
Whenever you need me, I'll be here (I'll never let you go)
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go

// Overboard //

[Jessica Jarrell:]
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, whoa

So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
Whoa

I never understood you when you'd say, oh
You wanted me to meet you halfway, whoa
I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change, cause now I see, oh

So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya
Got me out here in the water and I

I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver

[Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell:]
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do? Cause I still love you
And you're the only one who can save me
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Whoa

Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Yeah

// Up //

It's a big, big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to call it quits
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard, baby, believe me

That we can go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky, past the moon, through the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

It's a big, big world, and I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard, baby, believe me, oh

That we can go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky, past the moon, through the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up

Baby, we were under ground
We're on the surface now
We're gonna make it girl, I promise
If you believe in love and you believe in us
We can go nowhere but up

That we can go nowhere but up from here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We'll take it to the sky, past the moon, through the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere but up, nowhere but up
Whoa, nowhere but up, whoa
Yeah, nowhere but up, yeah yeah

// That Should Be Me //

Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? 'Cause baby I didn't

That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me

You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working because you know that

That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me

I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
Ooh

That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me

Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me

Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never shoulda let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go

// Kiss & Tell //

Yeah, JB, yeah, whoa, no no

Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies, don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what I give

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa oh, I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell, oh no no no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell, that's not me

// Where Are You Now //

Where are you now when I need you the most?
Why don't you take my hand?
I want to be close
Help me when I am down, lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Where are you now?

Where are you now now that I'm half grown?
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone
Where are you now when nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

I need you to need me
Can't you see me?
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me, hold me, and love me now
Where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Oh, where are you now?

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah
