// Be Like Them //

It's nothing new, hungry cats
Getting fatter minds and thinner ideas
Nothing new about that
Too little of this
Not enough of that
Nothing new about that

Insomnia dogs me, in this tired year

It's history, rabid dogs
Tearing skeletons into piles of bones
Nothing new about that
Too little of this
Not enough of that
Nothing new about that

They play it all for you
They explain it all to you
Telling you to be like them
Be like them

A state of irritation with leisurely pace
They lay it down for you
They set it up for you
Demanding that you too be like them
Be like them

It's a cracker joke, a cheap surprise
Painting in the corner, repeat flagrant lies
A shortage of ice, big increase of less
Standing far apart, world dying at your feet

They play it all for you
They explain it all to you
Telling you to be like them
Be like them demanding that you too be like them
Be like them
Be like them
Be like them
Be like them

// Cactused //

The collective hive-mind
Algorithmically scanning
Defending exploration
And language hair extensions

You'd better watch your step
You shouldn't place your bet
You may have played your hand
You didn't gauge demand
It's a throw-down
It's a tag-team angle
It's a face-off
Then a cheap shot low blow

Figuratively speaking
The meaning: quite porous
You are well-versed in verses
And chorus the chorus

Cactused informants
Scaling involvement
Discard new litanies
Deride conventions

// Primed And Ready //

Are you scoping the future?
Are you scouting the trail?
Are you opening the door?
Are you female and male?
Are you groomed for success?
Are you expecting to fail?
Are you digging in deep?
Do you intend to prevail?

A three hundred and sixty?
First class degree deal?
Are you primed?
Are you ready?
Re-inventing the wheel?

One way or another
Are you ready to bail?
Are you muddled or puzzled?
And all that it entails
Are you feeling quite smart?
Are you hiding your tail?
Are you facing extinction?
Are you under full sail?

// Off The Beach //

People standing, greeting, talking
People kissing, missing, whistling

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People walking, stalking, hawking
Vehicles parking, dogs are barking

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People shopping, buying, selling
People smoking, joking, hoping

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach
Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People praying, disappearing
CC. cameras, knives and hammers

People sleeping, broken, beaten
People lying, homeless, dying

// Unrepentant //

In between the lines
Ancient tales remind
Openings are hard to find
The blind will never lead the blind
Numbers can reveal their song
Harbours where we once belonged
Sailings for the greater good
Nurturing what we should

Unrepentant, understanding
Independent, making landing

Other memories other times
Seizing words to make the rhymes
Open season of the witch
Need the mood to scratch the itch
Even handed as we play
Reach the end without delay
Whistle dark because you can
Not to be an also ran

Unrepentant, understanding
Independent, making landing

Unrepentant, understanding
Independent, making landing
Unrepentant, understanding
Independent, making landing

// Shadows //

Combing the streets
Public addressing
The people are sorted
By gender and age

Shadow of the future
Shadow of the past
One minute of silence
Made out of wood

The men are lined up
Then shot into graves
The children are murdered
The women enslaved

Shadow of the future
Shadow of the past
One minute of silence
Made out of wood

// Oklahoma //

Oklahoma!

I admired your sexy hearse
You could tell I was dying
Under rehearsed

You found a secret place
The outer edge of inner space
A sunbeam hit your face
You were happy being there

I admire your sexy hearse
You knew I was dying
Over rehearsed

Under a pregnant cloud burst sky
You laughed and closed your eyes
We kissed you feigned surprise
Expressed a wish to learn to fly

Oklahoma

I admired your sexy hearse
It was true I was dying
Over rehearsed
I admired your sexy hearse
It was true I was dying
Over rehearsed!

// Hung //

The clouds were high
And the jury was hung

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

Trust was lost
And the wheels had spun

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done
In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done
In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

// Humming //

Spy the Russians
Brushing scandals
Under oligarchy rugs

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

Scope the bushes
Rustling longhorns
In a dust-cloud, Texan fog

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

Sinal dredges
Fashion wedges
At all end by vacuum fills

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

I've been wronged in rumor
Got to do with lies, no
From the Rockies to Chicago
From free zone to no-go
