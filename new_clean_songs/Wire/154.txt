// I Should Have Known Better //

In an act of contrition
I lay down by your side
It's not your place to comment
On my state of distress
For this is for real
I've tears in my eyes
Am I laughing or crying?
I suggest I'm not lying

I haven't found a measure yet to
Calibrate my displeasure yet so

To ignore my warning
Could be your folly
The judgement is harsh
I offer no plea

Valuing the vengeance which you treasure
I've redefined the meaning of vendetta

The procession's disordered
You protect your possessions
In light of your actions
I question your love

May I make an observation?
Your bite is worse than my aggression

I should have known better
I should have known better
Than to become a target
Albeit a target which moves

No offer of terms or concessions
For statements or confessions
You don't feel warm, I pass close by

You shiver, I whisper
Excuse me, what's your problem?
Oh, I see

I should have known better
I should have known better
You should have known
I should have known better
I should have known better
I should have known better
I should have known
I should have known
I should have known better
I should have known

// Two People In A Room //

Two people in a room
Facial movements betray
(A private display
Of nervous disorder)
And mutual torture

Two people in a room
(Bloody image is conjured
But no one is injured)
The weapons are chosen
But the action is frozen

Two people in a room, positions are shifted
The ceasefire uplifted, the lighting is fierce
It's intended to pierce any cloak of deceit
And encourage retreat, and God they're so gifted
My God, they're so gifted, my God, they're so gifted

Two people in a room
A personal locations
(An indication
Of previous decisions)
Aggressive decisions

// The 15th //

Reviewed, it seemed as if someone were watching over it
Before it was, as if response were based on fact

Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there

Renewed, it fought as if it had a cause to live for
Denied, it learned as if it had sooner been destroyed

Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there

Reviewed, it fought as if someone were watching over it
Before it had sooner been denied
Renewed, it seemed as if it had a cause to live for
Destroyed, it was later based on fact

Providing, deciding
It was soon there
Squared to it, faced to it
It was not there

// The Other Window //

He took his seat on the foreign train
He thought it pleasant to travel again
Mindful of the journey's end
He read again the letter from his friend
(Time passed as it often does)

The seat was hard, the carriage fetid
He was dressed for summer, but still he sweated
It was better than being at home
Feeling the cold and living alone
(Time passed slowly)

Around him, people spoke in French
Despite schooldays, it made no sense
Occasional stares caught his eye
He was tempted to smile, but
(Being shy, time passed)

When he looked through the window for the thousandth time
He saw a black horse fighting for its life
In a barbed wire fence, fatally tangled
The more it struggled, the more it strangled
(Time sped up)

He turned away, what could he do?
The other window had a nicer view

(Time passed painfully)
(Time passed painfully)
(Time passed painfully)

// Single K.O. //

I've found something
No one else is looking for
I've found something
That there's no use for

And what's more
I'm keeping it to myself

I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the floor
I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the door

Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O.
Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O.
But what's one submission
Amongst friends?

// A Touching Display //

With all the front and more besides
Bitch, thrust, and parry and a few asides
With considerable charm
You chose not to decide

I really like you becomes my massage
I really want you becomes my message
And how long can we sustain ourselves apart?
The pressure's increasing, it squeezes my heart

I bought a ticket, you took a walk
So much to say, we're unable to talk
Suffering in silence, our eyes give it away
So close as we part, a touching display
Colouring my thoughts, predominately grey and

Fighting bravely
Oh, will she save me?
From what or who
I do not know

// On Returning //

You'll be sorry when the sun has roasted you to
Lobster red, nothing said
When yellow has turned green to brown, divide by four
Multiply by nine, describe your divisions, anatomical derision

Lobster head and lobster feet
On arriving with a third language
Tucked into your briefcase, next to your toothbrush
Along with a copy of the Nouvelle Observateur

While your sons and daughters who registered nought
Under intensive electronic scanning
You regard your body with regard to events
Which with nothing planned

Never lacked a sense of theatre
On returning with the tan you've gained
A head of world service, the best of your culture
An evening of fun in the metropolis of your dream

An evening of fun in the metropolis of your dream
An evening of fun in the metropolis of your dream
An evening of fun in the metropolis of your dream
An evening of fun in the metropolis of your dream
...

// A Mutual Friend //

As a mutual friend
It was difficult to pretend
That I was anything less than concerned

Hearing of your troubles
Has forced me to double
My interest in your current affairs

It's no use despising
A new unknown horizon
Now your son has set his sights upon the moon

So precipitous a decision
Has clouded your vision
And altered the pitch of your tune

Please don't turn a deaf ear to the noises you hear
While savagely your love you prune
For he might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old with the moon

In March, April, May, and June
July, August, September, soon
He might replace the old with the moon

It could be October
November, or even December
So in January and February, remember

He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old quite soon
He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old with the moon

He might replace the old quite soon
He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old quite soon
He might replace the old with the moon

He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old with the moon
He might replace the old with the moon

He might replace the old quite soon
He might replace the old with the moon

// Blessed State //

Closing doors opens eyes
To the fatal gift of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh but butchered in the mind
Oh, what a pearl, what a well-made world

Closing doors opens eyes
To the fatal gift of a well timed lie
Loved in the flesh but butchered in the mind
Oh, what a pearl, what a well-made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well-made world

Holy globe, eternal home
Sacred sphere so glad I'm here
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world

Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world
Oh, what a pearl, what a well made world

// Once Is Enough //

It's sinister
I'd attempt a casual structure, preceding interaction
Symphonic in persuasion, noblesse oblige

Each minister
Is just a drop compared with having double vision
It's desirable in part, refuse the ruse

Deciding each devise if you don't think twice
Once is enough, once is enough
Preparing its demise, it's something you'll devise
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough

In passing
You sprang a leak instead, you'd sooner see its piety
You'd replied in its course before you resume transmission

Deciding each devise if you don't think twice
Once is enough, once is enough
Preparing its demise, it's something you'll devise
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough

You retiring
I'll respond with curtained thought a pause for intermission
My advice is simple, simple

Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough

Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough

Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough, once is enough
Once is enough

// Map Ref. 41°N 93°W //

An unseen ruler defines with geometry
An unrulable expanse of geography
An aerial photographer over-exposed
To the cartologist's 2D images knows
The areas where the water flowed
So petrified, the landscape grows

Straining eyes try to understand
The works, incessantly in hand
The carving and paring of the land
The quarter square, the graph divides
Beneath the rule, a country hides

Interrupting my train of thought
Lines of longitude and latitude
Define, refine my altitudes

Interrupting my train of thought
Lines of longitude and latitude
Define, refine my altitudes

The curtain's undrawn
Harness fitted, no escape
Common and peaceful, duck, flat, lowland
Landscape, canal, canard, water coloured

Crystal palaces for floral kings
A widespread waving span of wings
Witness the sinking of the sun
A deep breath of submission has begun

Interrupting my train of thought
Lines of longitude and latitude
Define, refine my altitudes

Interrupting my train of thought
Lines of longitude and latitude
Define, refine my altitudes

Interrupting my train of thought
Lines of longitude and latitude
Define, refine my altitudes

// Indirect Enquiries //

You gained respect as we passed
Not a wave, a gestured wink
I was forced to think
I couldn't ignore
I've seen you before

Joking aside, face to face
It's the one I cannot place
A hint might enlarge your imprint
I think I've had a taste of a savoury
Denial would be a waste

Lying prone
Hiding in a column, between SALE and ZDRK
Sky, sand, and moorland, shepherd's delight
But not in the sun
Which stops you from walking

I might find you
But I lack the patience
Passed a corner, you'd been stolen
Ate a meal, you'd been defaced

You'd been defaced...

// 40 Versions //

I never know which version I'm going to be
I seem to have so many choices open to me

It's not hard to see another unique event
When you miss the beginning and you miss the end

I've got forty versions all dying to get the part
And so with a change of mind comes a change of heart

A total eclipse arrives now and Niagara Falls
No loss of blood yet and no further calls

I never know which version I'm going to be
I get the feeling my mind is deceiving me

In between are where only edges can be seen of the spaces

// Get Down (Part I & II) //

La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la

La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la

La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la
La la la, la la, la la la

// Let's Panic Later //

Lights focused for another country
Diplomatically immune, diplomatically immune
My passport's stamped, my visa's in order
Diplomatically immune, diplomatically immune

A grey sky in March helps me to remember
Ein bier, ein cafe, ein bier, ein cafe
The freezing fog in mid-November
Downhill all the way, downhill all the way

How I wish the roads were straighter
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later

My reservations and impatience grow
All of the time, all of the time
Honesty and humour thrive in the harsh city
Stripped and alert, stripped and alert
Stripped and alert, stripped and alert

Highly emotional, but this time composed
What is in store? What is in store?
What is in store? What is in store?
What is in store? What is in store?

This time composed
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later
