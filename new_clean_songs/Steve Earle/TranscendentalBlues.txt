Album: TranscendentalBlues

// Transcendental Blues //

In the darkest hour of the longest night
If it was in my power I'd step into the light
Candles on the alter, penny in your shoe
Walk upon the water - transcendental blues

Happy ever after 'til the day you die
Careful what you ask for, you don't know 'til you try
Hands are in your pockets, starin' at your shoes
Wishin' you could stop it - transcendental blues

If I had it my way, everything would change
Out here on this highway the rules are still the same
Back roads never carry you where you want 'em to
They leave you standin' there with them ol' transcendental blues

// Everyone's In Love With You //

Everyone's in love with You
Everyone's in love with you
But you don't seem to mind
But it must be tough when you're cleanin' up
Them broken hearts sometimes
Or maybe you just struggle through
And leave 'em where they lie
But everyone's in love with you
In love with you

Everyone's in love with you
They fall down at your feet
And impale themselves knowin' full well
You'll only watch 'em bleed
And they won't stop 'til the final drop
'Cause they think it's what you need
And everyone's in love
In love with you

You want everyone to want you
But you don't want anyone to need you
'Cause baby you don't need to

Everyone's in love with you
Or don't you think I know
The way they all light up when you show up
And you're baskin' in the glow
I'd like to say that I ain't that way
Like all your other fools
But everyone's in love with you
And I am, too
I am, too

// Another Town //

One of these days when my minds made up
And I'm sick and tired of hangin' around
I'll be on my way in a cloud of dust
On the road to another town
Once upon a time I loved this house
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout burnin' it down
And I'll be long gone when the fire burns out
On the way to another town
To see another city in another light
With my past behind me and my future bright

One of these days when I've had enough
Buddy, you ain't gonna see me around
Just as soon as I get my courage up
Gonna take it to another town

I used to walk these streets with my head held high
Now I'm always lookin' down at the ground
But I see my feet on the outbound side
Of a road to another town

And I'm gonna tell everybody I know
Yeah I'm gonna spread it around
That there's a great big world out there where I go
On the road to another town
To see another city in another light
With my past behind me and my future bright

One of these days when my mind's made up
And I'm sick and tired of hangin' around
I'll be down that road in a cloud of dust
On the way to another town

// I Can Wait //

In the blink of an eye
Stars'll fall from the sky
No one even notices
If you think it'll help
I can walk out myself
And we won't have to go through this
If I pretend to hold you tight
And out on the highway late some night
That's all right
If that's all that it takes
Even if my heart breaks
Darlin' I can wait

I have nothin' but time
And this poor heart of mine
Probably could use some rest
When the ghosts are all gone
You can leave your light on
Shinin' through the loneliness
Just like a beacon in the night
Brighter than any star in sight
But that's all right
For as long as it takes
For that mornin' to break
Darlin' I can wait

Out where the mountains meet the sky
Feelin' so lonesome I could cry
But that's all right
'Cause all the signs say
You'll call me someday
Darlin' I can wait

// The Boy Who Never Cried //

Long ago and far away
In a land no map can find
There lived in long forgotten days
A boy who never cried
He was his mother's only child
So she never wondered why
Until the news spread far and wide
Of a boy who never cried

From fabled lands the pilgrims came
To behold the silent child
In ancient tones they sang his name
Over every lonely mile
There were those who came in reverence
There were those who stood outside
And whispered low in quatrains dim
Of a boy who never cried

Days grew long and short until
The seasons turned to years
The child grew strong and fairer still
With a face unstained by tears
And every maid and lady fair
Held her breath when he passed by
For their mothers bid them all beware
Of a man who never cries

He lived alone for all his years
And then on the day he died
He shed a single precious tear for a boy who never cried

// Steve's Last Ramble //

I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' round
Hangin' up my highway shoes
Lately when I walk they make a hollow sound
And they carry me away from you
Every night I lay my body down
My empty arms just leave me blue
So I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
And find my way back home to you

I have always been the travelin' kind
A million miles behind me now
I kept on followin' that thin white line
But now I want to turn around
I only lived to hear that highway sound
High and lonesome - low and blue
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
And find my way back home to you

So say goodbye to all my ramblin' pals
Ol' Highway Dave and Southside Sue
I don't believe they'll miss me anyhow
What's one less wayward soul or two
Down the road they'll pass the jug around
And they'll sing them lonesome highway blues
But me I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
And find my way back home to you

// The Galway Girl //

Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day -I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day -I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
I've traveled around I've been all over this world
Boys, I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl

// Lonelier Than This //

It doesn't get any lonelier than this
I believe my heart'll break
Tonight I prayed I'd die before I wake
With every breath I'm tastin' your kiss
And it's sweet upon my tongue
Until the bitter tears fall one by one

It doesn't get any lonelier than this
'Cause I'm on this road alone
My heartbeat ringin' like a hollow drum
I'm about as lonesome as a poor boy gets
And there's nothin' I can do
'Cause it's dark out here and I can't find you
It doesn't get any lonelier than this

It doesn't get any lonelier than this
I'm as blue as blue can be
Just an empty place where your love should be
I'm sick and tired of walkin' around like this
With my heart outside my skin
Scared to death we'll never touch again
It doesn't get any lonelier than this
And there's no place I can go
Just the dusty corners that the shadows know
Maybe this is as good as it's gonna get
And I'll always be this way
I'll just wander this world callin' out your name
It doesn't get any lonelier than this

// Wherever I Go //

Well I was born on a rainy day
With a dark cloud hangin' down low
Now it follows me wherever I go
There were days I've sworn that I'd blow away
With the cold wind chillin' my bones
'Cause it follows me wherever I go

In the midnight hour when I'm all alone
There's a hurtin' deep down in my soul
And it follows me wherever I go
When the sun shines down on my heart it's gone
But there's another night comin' I know
'Cause it follows me wherever I go

[Chorus:]
I could drink corn whisky 'til my brain goes soft
I could run this highway 'til my wheels come off
And these blues keep comin' around
And follow me down

Well one of these days I'm gonna leave this town
But I won't have to travel alone
'Cause if follows me wherever I go

[Chorus]

I wanna go somewhere where I can't be found
And I won't have to carry this load
But it follows me wherever I go

// When I Fall //

Late at night on some dark deserted highway
On my way to another lonesome town
I thought I might see the first light of a new day
As it lay like fool's gold on the ground

[Chorus:]
But whenever I'm feelin' low
I won't have to cry alone I know
'Cause you will answer when I call
If I soar above the clouds and then
I come crashin' back to earth again
You will catch me when I fall

All these years I've watched you trip and stumble
There were times that I feared that you were lost
But every tear that I dried after you tumbled
Comes to mind when I'm considerin' the cost

[Chorus]

In my heart there's a place for you to run to
Anytime you're tired and hurt and blue
For my part I have only to remind you
You will find me waiting when you do

[Chorus]

// I Don't Want To Lose You Yet //

Baby it's a cold hard world out there
Broken hearted people everywhere
Takin' whatever love they get
I don't wanna wind up like that, so

[Chorus:]
Baby throw your arms around my neck
Lay your pretty head against my chest
Listen to one heartbeat then the next
'Cause baby I don't wanna lose you yet

You know I love you and I know you love me
It's everything that love's supposed to be
But I don't wanna look up one day
And find out we let it slip away

[Chorus]

Can't tell you nothin' 'bout love I guess
That you don't already know
But girl, when you're in my arms like this
I don't ever wanna let you go

Baby maybe I'm wrong but what it I'm right
And everything's depending on us tonight
Maybe we'll pass this way again
But honey I don't wanna wait 'til then, so

[Chorus]

// Halo 'Round The Moon //

There's a halo 'round the moon
So I know it ain't to blame
'Cause I knew what love could do
But I loved her just the same
Then I let her slip away
Now I'm all alone and blue
That's the price I got to pay
There's a halo 'round the moon

There's a ghost that haunts this town
Just ask anyone you see
He drags his chain around
And no spell can set him free
And he looks a lot like me
And if you ask him why he's bound
He'll just say he lost the key
There's a ghost that haunts this town

There's no shelter from the storm
Without the lightnin' and the rain
And love would hold no charm
If it wasn't for the pain
And it's always been that way
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
There's a halo 'round the moon

// Until The Day I Die //

Back in the hills when we were only kids
Love shined like a diamond in your eyes
I swore I'd never hurt you - then I did
Now I'm all alone with all my lies
I promised that I'd never be untrue
I'd never make you cry
The only promise that I didn't break
Was to love you until the day I die

I wish I'd never seen those city lights
A sight for a country boy to see
For every one that you see shinin' bright
Another is burnin' out like me
I wouldn't listen though you told me dear
I couldn't see the lie
But all the same I still love you tonight
And I'll love you until the day I die

They built this prison just for fools like me
Who don't know a treasure from a stone
I killed a man now I won't ever see
The green rollin' hills where I was born
No I won't ever see your face again
But if I close my eyes
I can almost hear you call me back to then
And I'll love you until the day I die

// All Of My Life //

I guess I don't get out too much
If it wasn't enough I hear all these voices
Always tellin' me that I'm bad
But it's all in my head - like all those scary noises

[Chorus:]
I've been waiting all of my life
All of my life
I've been waiting all of my life
All of my life

Some nights when I'm laying in bed
Wish I was dead - and I know you'd never miss me
But I know where you go when you dream
Strange as that seems 'cause I never even kissed you

[Chorus]

Everybody wants to be somebody's somethin'
Ain't nobody wants to be blue
Ain't nobody anywhere ever loved nothin'
Half as much as I love you
Somebody somewhere said "love is a prison"
But no one really wants to be free
I'd have to be crazy to ever think someone
Could love a nobody like me

I'm here alone in the dark
But I know where you are
'Cause I can hear you breathin'
Come a little closer you'll find
You were meant to be mine
'Cause you're the only reason

[Chorus 2x]

// Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song) //

The warden said he'd mail my letter
The chaplain's waitin' by the door
Tonight we'll cross the yard together
Then they can't hurt me anymore

I am going over yonder
Where no ghost can follow me
There's another place beyond here
Where I'll be free I believe

Give my radio to Johnson
Thibodeaux can have my fan
Send my Bible home to Mama
Call her every now and then

I suppose I got it comin'
I can't ever pay enough
All my rippin' and a runnin'
I hurt everyone I loved

The world'll turn around without me
The sun'll come up in the east
Shinin' down on all of them that hate me
I hope my goin' brings 'em peace
