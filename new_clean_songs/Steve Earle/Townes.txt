Album: Townes

// Pancho And Lefty //

Livin' on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene

Weren't you mama's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said, "Goodbye"
Sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit, boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel

Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin' words
But that's the way it goes

All the federales say
"They could have had him any day"
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in lefty's mouth

The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

All the federales say
"They could have had him any day"
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

The poets tell how Pancho fell
And lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told

Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for lefty, too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old

All the federales say
"We could have had him any day"
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

A few old gray federales say
"Could have had him any day"
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

// Colorado Girl //

I'm goin' out to Denver
See if I can't find
I'm goin' out to Denver
See if I can't find
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine

The promise in her smile
Shames the mountains tall
The promise in her smile
Shames the mountains tall
She bring the sun to shining
Tell the rain to fall

It's been a long time, mama
Since I heard you call my name
Ah, been a long time
Since I heard you call my name
I got to see my Colorado girl again

Be there tomorrow
Mama, don't you cry
Be there tomorrow
Now, mama, don't you cry
I got to kiss these
Lonesome Texas blues goodbye

I'm goin' out to to Denver
See if I can't find
I'm goin' out to to Denver
See if I can't find
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine

// Where I Lead Me //

Where I lead me, I will travel
Where I need me, I will call me
I'm no fool, I'll be ready, God knows I will be
And in the meantime make a little money and buy a little mercy

Met this morning, now he loves me, says he loves me
It must be easy, look around you, all around you
But you see the motion, you're not movin'
You don't know how to hold on
Just keep it loose, don't get excited, it'll pass before long

Now one is goin' one is stayin'
One is silent one is saying'
Here's your coat, take care of yourself, sorry you're leavin'
A little sad, you're all I had will you be returnin'

The boys upstairs are gettin' hungry
You can shout in the wind about how it will be
Or you can clench your fist, shake your head
And head to the country I got no doubt about it my friend
That's where they'll find me, that's where they're gonna find me

Ask the boys down in the gutter
Now they won't lie cause you don't matter
The street's just fine if you're good and blind
But it ain't where you belong

Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
And carry yourself home
Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
And carry yourself home

// Lungs //

Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.

Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight.
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another.

Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

Jesus was an only son
And love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one, and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you
We'll tell the world we tried

// No Place To Fall //

If I had no place to fall
And I needed to
Could I count on you
To lay me down?

I'd never tell you no lies
I don't believe it's wise
You got pretty eyes
Won't you spin me 'round

I ain't much of a lover, it's true
I'm here, then I'm gone
And I'm forever blue
But I'm sure wanting you

Skies full of silver and gold
Try to hide the sun
But it can't be done
Least not for long

And if we help each other grow
While the light of day
Smiles down our way
Then we can't go wrong

Time, she's a fast old train
She's here, then she's gone
And she won't come again
Won't you take my hand

If I had no place to fall
And I needed to
Could I count on you
To lay me down?

// Loretta //

Well Loretta, she's a bar-room girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe

Her age is always 22
Her laughin' eyes a hazel hue
Spends my money like water falls
Loves me like I want her to

Oh Loretta, won't you say to me?
Darlin', put your guitar on
Have a little shot of booze
Play a blue and wailin' song

My guitar rings a melody
My guitar sings, Loretta's fine
Long and lazy, blonde and free
I can have her any time

Sweetest at the break of day
Prettiest in the settin' sun
She don't cry when I can't stay
'Least not till she's all alone

Loretta, I won't be gone long
Keep your dancin' slippers on
Keep me on your mind a while
I'll be back babe to make you smile

Loretta, she's a bar-room girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe

// Brand New Companion //

I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
You know she cools me with her breathin'
Chases away those howlin' bottles of wine

She fits just like my guitar
Man, she's near as tall as me
She fits just like my guitar
She's near as tall as me
She lives way out the D train
But she's Texas as can be

She got a home-spun disposition
Man, she's just as gentle as you please
She got a home-spun disposition
Man, she's just as gentle as you please
She got arms just like two rattle snakes
Legs just like a billow in the breeze

I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I got a brand new companion
Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I want to trace her with my body
I want to track her with my mind

// Rake //

I used to wake and run with the moon
I lived like a rake and a young man
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
My laughter, the Devil would frighten

The sun, she would come and beat me back down
But every cruel day had its nightfall
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
Full of fire and forgetful

My body was sharp, the dark air clean
And outrage my joyful companion
Whisperin' women, how sweet did they seem
Kneelin' for me to command them

And time was like water but I was the sea
I'd have never noticed it passin'
Except for the turnin' of night into day
And the turnin' of day into cursin'

You look at me now and don't think I don't know
What all your eyes are a sayin'
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies
They're just tricks that his brains been a playin'?

A lover of women, he can't hardly stand
He trembles, he's bent and he's broken
I've fallen it's true but I say unto you
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken

I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known
I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven
But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and
Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding

I buried my face but it spoke once again
The night to the day we're a bindin'
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding

// Delta Momma Blues //

Come away with me,
My little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
That I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if you're blue don't cry
Just wander right downtown
You can find your delta mama waitin' there
Well, I thought you knew that I
Would never let you down
I can ease your mind and take away your cares

Come away with me,
My little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
That I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if the grass goes brown
Don't you hang your head too low
Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine
If you'll just ask around
I'm sure someone will know
Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feelin fine

Well, if you don't know by now
What I've been tryin' so hard to say
Well my delta boy I'm afraid you're up to tight
But you take it slow and somehow
You come meandering out my way
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right

Ah, come away with me,
My little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
That I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

// Marie //

I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know

I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more

Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
Van and do a little settlin' down

But I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway

Unemployment said I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call

Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall

I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago

They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them low life so and so's
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault, I suppose

The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
Two freights everyday
If it was just me, I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train

She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me

Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend

I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry

Marie she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to Heaven
My little boy safe inside

I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
So's to meet me by and by

Marie will know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and by

// Don't Take It Too Bad //

Well, don't you take it too bad
If you're feelin' unlovin'
If you're feelin' unfeelin'
If you're feelin' alone
Don't take it too bad

'Cause it ain't you to blame, babe
Lord, it's some kind of game, babe
Out of all of this living
That we've got left to do

And if you go searching
For rhyme or for reason
Then you won't have the time
That it takes just for talkin'

About the places you've been, babe
About the faces you've seen, babe
And how soft the time flies
Past your window at night

And we just can't have that, girl
'Cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world
And a man needs a woman
Just to stand by his side

And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams
And roses and playthings
And the sweetness of springtime
And the sound of the rain

// Mr. Mudd And Mr. Gold //

Well the wicked king of clubs awoke
And it was to his queen turned
His lips were laughing as they spoke
His eyes like bullets burned

The sun's upon a gambling day
His queen smiled low and blissfully
Let's make some wretched fool to play
Plain it was she did agree

He send his deuce down into diamond
His four to hart, and his trey to spade
Three kings with their legions come
Preparations soon where made

They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky

Well, he gave his sevens first instructions
Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
Between a man named Gold and man named Mud

Club filled Gold with greedy vapors
Till his long, green eyes did glow
And Mudd was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Now, the Diamond Queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
And prayed to the angels every one

Now, the Diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
And the Diamond Angel filled Muds hole
The wicked King of Clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold

Now, three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

The club queen heard her husband's call
But Lord, that Queen of Diamond's joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy

Now, Mudd he checked and Gold bet all
And Mudd he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted on his face
When Mudd turned over that diamond ace

Now, here's what this story's told
If you feel like Mudd you'll end up Gold
If you feel like lost, you'll end up found
So amigo, lay them raises down

// (Quicksilver Daydreams Of) Maria //

Well, a diamond fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
The brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes

Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
Then caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea

Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
When her image comes dancin' the sun she turns sullen with shame
And the birds they go silent the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whispering her name

So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sigh
Ah, they promise eternally that she lies hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye

So the serpent slide softly away with his moments of laughter
And the the old washer-woman has finished her cleanin' and gone
But the bamboo hang heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong

// To Live Is To Fly //

Won't say I love you, babe
Won't say I need you, babe
I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong

Living's mostly wasting time
I'll waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long

Well you're soft as glass
And I'm a gentleman
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon

Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
Don't turn none away

Everything is not enough
And nothin' is too much to bear
Where you've been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there

Well to live is to fly, all low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
But think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line

Well I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think to much
On things you leave behind

Well I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a bringin' back the melodies
And rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own

The choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone

Well to live is to fly, all low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
Shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes
