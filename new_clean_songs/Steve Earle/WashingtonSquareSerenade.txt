// Tennessee Blues //

Sunset in my mirror, pedal on the floor
Bound for New York City and I won't be back no more
Won't be back no more, boys won't see me around
Goodbye guitar town

Ghosts out on the highway, voices on the wind
Tellin' me that we may never pass this way again
Voices on the highway angels beckonin'
Like a long lost friend

Fare thee well I'm bound to roam
This ain't never been my home

Stranger in my mirror, lines around my eyes
String around my finger but I don't remember why
Don't remember why, boys don't remember how
Goodbye guitar town

Fare thee well I'm bound to roam
This ain't never been my home

Blue dog on my floorboard, redhead by my side
Cross the mighty Hudson river to the New York City side
Redhead by my side, boys sweetest thing I've found
Goodbye guitar town

// Down Here Below //

Pale male the famous redtail hawk performs wingstands high above midtown Manhattan
Circles around for one last pass over the park
Got his eye on a fat squirrel down there and a couple of pigeons
They got no place to run they got no place to hide

But pale male he's cool, see 'cause his breakfast ain't goin' nowhere
So he does a loop t loop for the tourists and the six o'clock news
Got him a penthouse view from the tip-top of the food chain, boys
He looks up and down on Fifth Ave and says "God I love this town"

But life goes on down here below
And all us mortals struggle so
We laugh and cry
And live and die
That's how it goes
For all we know
Down here below

I saw Joe Mitchell's ghost on a downtown 'A' train
He just rides on forever now that the Fulton fish market's shut down
He said 'they ain't never gonna get that smell out of the water
I don't give a damn how much of that new money they burn'

Now hell's kitchen's Clinton and the Bowery's Nolita
And the East Village's creepin' 'cross the Williamsburg Bridge
And hey, whatever happened to alphabet city?
Ain't no place left in this town that a poor boy can go

But life goes on down here below
And all us mortals struggle so
We laugh and cry
And live and die
That's how it goes
For all we know
Down here below

Pale male swimmin' in the air
Looks like he's in heaven up there
People sufferin' everywhere
But he don't care

But life goes on down here below
And all us mortals struggle so
We laugh and cry

// Satellite Radio //

Top of my shift-frog in my throat-sleep in my eyes
Startin' to drift, cuppa hot joe, checkin' the sky
Never can tell, makin' my list, checkin' it twice
Fasten my belt, flippin' my switch, checkin' my mic

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?

Listen to the radio
Listen to the radio

Turn it on
Turn it up

What if they're right? What if I'm wrong? What if we're kings?
One of these nights-play the right song-telephone rings
Stone in the sea, shot in the dark, splittin' the air
Listen to me, kindle the spark, answer my prayer

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Does anybody care, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to us tonight on the satellite radio?

Listen to the radio
Listen to the radio

Turn it on

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?

Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?

Listen to the radio

// City Of Immigrants //

Livin' in a city of immigrants
I don't need to go travelin'
Open my door and the world walks in
Livin' in a city of immigrants
Livin' in a city that never sleeps
My heart keepin' time to a thousand beats
Singin' in languages I don't speak
Livin' in a city of immigrants

City of black
City of white
City of light
City of innocents
City of sweat
City of tears
City of prayers
City of immigrants

Livin' in a city where the dreams of men
Reach up to touch the sky and then
Tumble back down to earth again
Livin' in a city that never quits
Livin' in a city where the streets are paved
With good intentions and a people's faith
In the sacred promise a statue made
Livin' in a city of immigrants

City of stone
City of steel
City of wheels
Constantly spinnin'
City of bone
City of skin
City of pain
City of immigrants

All of us are immigrants
Every daughter, every son
Everyone is everyone
All of us are immigrants - everyone
Livin' in a city of immigrants
River flows out and the sea rolls in
Washin' away nearly all of my sins
Livin' in a city of immigrants

City of black
City of white
City of light
Livin' in a city of immigrants
City of sweat
City of tears
City of prayers
Livin' in a city of immigrants

City of stone
City of steel
City of wheels
Livin' in a city of immigrants

City of bone
City of skin
City of pain
City of immigrants
All of us are immigrants

// Sparkle And Shine //

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine
She blesses all that she sees
A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
But she don't love no one but me
And I can't believe she's mine

Shimmering she moves
Sunlight all around her
Even when she's blue
Silver clouds surround her

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And I can't believe she's mine

My baby swings down the street
Big tall high heel shoes on her feet
Walks by and my heart skips a beat
And I'm stumblin' like a fool
She give me somethin' so sweet
I can't sleep y'all and I can't eat
Sparks fly whenever we meet
I'm breathless 'cause she's so cool

Anywhere she goes
I can only follow
She'll be there I know
When I awake tomorrow

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

And everyone knows she's mine

// Come Home To Me //

Yellow moon, amber light
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
Another blue and lonesome night
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me

I knew I'd cry, when you were gone
Baby, baby, baby please come home to me
Thought I'd survive but I was wrong
Baby, baby, baby, please

Just as soon as you were out that door
I remembered what my life was like before
Now nothin's gonna be the same again
'Cause I'm lonelier than I was then
And I can't ever let this feelin' go
'Cause now I know

I stay up late wake up alone
Aw baby, baby, baby please come home to me

No matter what I say or do
I know I'll never get over losin' you
So I'm crossin' my heart and promisin'
If I get you in my arms again
I'm not ever gonna let you go
'Cause now I know

The doors unlocked
The light is on
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
Baby, baby, baby, please

// Jericho Road //

I was walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And every mile that I traveled showed
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
I just kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And the sun set red over fields of gold
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
Well Joshua fit the battle, that's how the story goes
And the walls come a-tumb-a-lin' down I know
But I'm still walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my mother walkin' down the Jericho road
Tears in her eyes and her head hung low
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my father walkin' down the Jericho road
His back bent over from a heavy load
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
I said "Papa, don't you know me? Won't you lay your burden down?"
He just shook his head and told me "Son, you better turn around"
And he kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my brother walkin' down the Jericho road
And his hands were bloody but his face was clean
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my sister walkin' down the Jericho road
With a babe in her arms that I'd never seen
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
She said "It's just a little orphan child I found along the way
I'll raise him as my own and he'll forgive us all someday"
And she kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my mother
I met my father
I met my brother
I met my sister

// Oxycontin Blues //

Well my daddy worked in the coal mine
Till the company shut it down
Then he sat around and drank hisself blind
Till we put him back underground
Now nothin' grows on this mountain
And what's a poor boy to do?
Except to wander these hills forgotten
With the oxycontin blues

Well I never cared much for whiskey
'Cause it only made daddy mean
Wrapped a little bit tight they tell me
For the methamphetamine
Then my cousin come up from Knoxville
And he taught me a thing or two
Now I'm headed nowhere but downhill
With the oxycontin blues

Got a dollar bill in my pocket
Got a half a tank in my truck
I'm gonna go and pawn grandma's locket
Hell, maybe it'll change my luck
Ain't nothin gonna be right no how
'Cause I know I can't ever lose
This devil that's draggin' me down
And the oxycontin blues

// Red Is The Color //

North wind blowin' like a hurricane house
Old man leanin' like he's pullin' a plow
Neck bowed, bendin' like a willow bough

Red sky color of the end of time
Bleeds dry runnin' down the center line
Wise guy pretends he doesn't see the signs

Bad news everybody talkin' 'bout
A short fuse a half an inch from burnin' out
All used up beyond a reasonable doubt

Make way for his majesty the prodigal king
Still taste the poison when you're kissin' the ring
Don't say he never gave you anything

Deep breath the calm before the storm begins
Cold sweat pretend that you ain't listenin'
Don't bet on gettin' by with that again

Short ride from here to where the beast resides
Fine line that separates the shadows inside
Make mine a double shot of cyanide

// Steve's Hammer (For Pete) //

One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
And I won't have to drag this weight around
When there ain't no hunger
And there ain't no pain
Then I won't have to swing this thing
One of these day I'm gonna lay this hammer down

One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune
All night long beneath the silvery moon
When the war is over
And the union's strong
Won't sing no more angry songs
One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune

Someday when my struggle's through
I won't have to strive
Until then all I can do
Is let my hammer fly

One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
Leave my burden restin' on the ground
When the air don't choke ya and the ocean's clean
And kids don't die for gasoline
One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down

John Henry was a mighty man
Worked his whole life long
When he made that hammer ring
He always sang this song

One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
And I won't have to drag this weight around
When there ain't no hunger
And there ain't no pain
Then I won't have to swing this thing
One of these day I'm gonna lay this hammer down

Yeah, one of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down

// Days Aren't Long Enough //

Another year has come and gone
Another circle 'round the sun
Another thousand tears have fallen
I don't ever count 'em 'cause
I'm surrounded by your love
And days are never long enough

Four more seasons on parade
Show their colors then they fade
But that won't happen to us, darlin'
We'll remember how it was
Then begin again because
Days are never long enough

Time's never late
Isn't bound by our fate
Try as we may
Love might never be found if we wait
Until the sun comes up
On another day my love
Days are never long enough

Time's never late
Isn't bound by our fate
Try as we may
Love might never be found if we wait
Until the sun comes up
On another day my love
Days are never long enough

// Way Down In The Hole //

When you walk through the garden
You gotta watch your back
Well I beg your pardon
Walk the straight and narrow track
If you walk with Jesus
He's gonna save your soul
You gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole

He's got the fire and the fury
At his command
Well you don't have to worry
If you hold on to Jesus' hand
We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
Just gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole

All the angels sing
'Bout Jesus' mighty sword
And they'll shield you with their wings
And keep you close to the Lord
Don't pay heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole

Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole

(In the bottom of a hole)
