Album: EverythingNow

// Everything_Now (Continued) //

I'm in the black again
Can't make it back again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

// Everything Now //

Every inch of sky's got a star
Every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
Every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

(Everything now)
(Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
Every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, and everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!) 'Til every room in my house
(Everything now!) Is filled with shit
(Everything now!) I couldn't live without
(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la la la

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la la la

Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!) And every room in my house
(Everything now!) Is filled with shit
(Everything now!) I couldn't live without
(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!) Every inch of space
(Everything now!) In my heart
(Everything now!) Is filled with something I'll never start

The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now

// Signs Of Life //

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
Wait outside until it begins
Won't be the first ones in

Spend your life waiting in life
You find it hard to define
But you do it every time
Then you do it again

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

First kiss tastes like cigarettes
Dead man walking take your bets
Once again you lost your friends
Around and around again

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
"Where are we going?"
Who did you ask?

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
In a world of cigarette ash
"Where are we going?"
Who did you ask?
Who did you ask?

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, sometimes Sunday
Love is hard, sex is easy
God in heaven, could you please me?

You think you invented life
You find it hard to define
But you do it every time
Then you do it again

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Still looking for signs of life (Signs of Life)
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
In a world of cigarette ash
"Where are we going?"
Who did you ask?
Who did you ask?

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

(Still looking)
Looking for signs of life
(Signs of life)
Still looking for signs of life
(Signs of life)

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

// Creature Comfort //

Some boys hate themselves
Spend their lives resenting their fathers
Some girls hate their bodies
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

Assisted suicide
She dreams about dying all the time
She told me she came so close
Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
Some girls cut themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
Some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Creature comfort makes it painless
Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't see it
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
Well if you're not sure, better safe than sorry

Creature comfort, make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

We're the bones under your feet
The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat
I'm a liar, don't doubt my sincerity

Just make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

Na-na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na-na
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
Creature comfort, make it painless

// Peter Pan //

In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
I just wanna live forever
Keep my promises, keep it together
In my dreams you're living
Open your eyes, and I wake up forgiven
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Boys and girls got all the answers
Men and women keep growing their cancers
Singing

In my dreams we're kissing
It wakes me up, but you've gone missing
Born so close, but we grow apart
And all the sickness starts in the heart
In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
'Cause it's a date night, dead-eyed American dream
And it leaves you baby, if you let it leave
Singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing

// Electric Blue //

Summer's gone and so are you
See the sky electrocute
A thousand boys that look like you
Cover my eyes electric blue

Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

A thousand girls that look like me
Staring out at the open sea
Repeat the words until they're true
Cover my eyes electric blue

Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Now you've got me so confused
'Cause I don't know how to sing your blues
Jesus Christ, what could I do?
I don't know how to sing your blues

Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it, but I found out

Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you

// Good God Damn //

You want to get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
And fill the bathtub up
You want to say goodbye
To your oldest friends

With the good God damn
With the good God damn

Lay out your clothes
It's time to go
It's always darkest before the dawn
The sun never shows
I could say goodbye
To your oldest friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Maybe there's a good God
Damn

Let me get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
Fill the bathtub up
You could say goodbye
To your sick old friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God
If He made you

If He made you

// Put Your Money On Me //

Put your money on me
'Cause I can barely breathe
Put your money on me

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

If there was a race, a race for your heart
It started before you were born
Above the chloroform sky
Clouds made of ambien
Sitting on carpets in the basement of Heaven
We were born innocent, but it lasts a day
And baby you can give all the money away
But if there's a race, a race for your heart
It's over before it starts
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

All my presents are broken before they're open
And the promises, the second they're spoken
I know I've been different
My skin keeps shedding
My mother was crying on the day of our wedding
Trumpets of angels call for my head
I fight through the ether and I'll quit when I'm dead
If you want to know who'll be there in the end
When you bury me, baby, I'll still be your friend
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy

(To put your money on me)
('Cause I can barely breathe)
(When you put your money on me)
When Silicon Valley's melted back into silicon
We'll find a way to survive
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy
To put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not easy

(To put your money on me)
(All your money on me)

// We Don't Deserve Love //

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
A terrible song on the radio
Baby what else is new?

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
You say I can't see the forest for the trees
So burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause God knows where I've been
Officer please, don't check my breath
That ain't my only sin

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all of the wreckage
When we met, you'd never expect this
And you said, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
Terrible song on the radio
Baby what else is new?
Been hiding my scars in broad daylight bars
Behind laugh tracks on TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
(We don't deserve love)

Mary, roll away the stone
The men that you love
Always leave you alone
Well go on Mary
Roll away the stone
The men you love always leave you alone
You hear your mother screaming
You hear your daddy shouting
You try to figure it out
You never figured it out
Your mother's screaming
That you don't deserve love
If you don't deserve love
And if I don't deserve love
What could we deserve?
Come down off your cross
And tell me!
It's always the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one that you love
Always gonna leave you alone
Particularly the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one you love
Always leave you alone
It's always the Christ-types
You're waiting on

// Everything Now (Continued) //

I'm in the black again
Not coming back again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

I'm in the red again
Red space in my head again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now
