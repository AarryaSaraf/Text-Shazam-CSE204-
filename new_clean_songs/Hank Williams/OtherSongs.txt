// 30 Pieces Of Silver //

Tis a sad but true story from the Bible it came
And it tells us how Judas sold the Savior in shame
He planned with the council of high priest that day
30 pieces of silver was the price they would pay

30 pieces of silver 30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced him but he died not in vain

T'was on there on the hillside the multitude came
And found our dear Savior then took him away
They bruised and they mocked him thorns was crowned around his head
And his garment of purple showed the blood stains of red

Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun
Judas begged mercy for what he had done
He gave back the silver for his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountain he took his own life

30 pieces of silver 30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain

// I'll Fly Away //

Some bright morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore
I'll, I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

When the troubles of this life are gone
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away
To a land where no sorrows are known
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

// Where The Old Red River Flows //

I'm dreaming tonight of Dixie cotton fields and Whippoorwills 
Where I used to live and wander through the rocks and through the rivs 
I can see my old dear mammy while around the place she'd go
On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Ayyy deeeeee dooooloooooooooo

You can hear those darkies crooning soft and low 
And the twilight in the evening so loooooo so soft and loooooooo

On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows 

Well the lights tonight on Broadway electric lights shine bright as day 
On the beach at Coney Island where the laughter makes you gay 
But I'm going back tonight love on the icy wind she goes
To my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Ayyy deeeeee dooooloooooooooo

You can hear those darkies crooning soft and low 
And the twilight in the evening so loooooo so soft and loooooooo

On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows
