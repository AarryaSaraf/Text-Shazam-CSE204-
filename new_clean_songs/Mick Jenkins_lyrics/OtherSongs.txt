// The Truth //

What they make us have face
Riskin' myself, my life, my woman, my sister, my children
On some idealism that you assure me is in America
That I have never seen
Oh, it got 'em feelin' a way

Chain smokin', rollin' back to back
Train ago, no holdin' back the pack
Them gangster quotes you spoke, can't take them back
They ain't supposed to know shit, that's a fact
Divided by the quotation, that's the truth
Lost patience and some more shit, what it do
Wasted time, I'm focused on the future
Planted seeds, I'm tryna grow some [?]
Manatees around you, I go deeper
Fantasies around you, I'm a truther
Luther, never too much, it's a booster
Rap cap calm, niggas froze, no Medusa
We ain't here to marvel at the hoes and
We ain't finna gravel at the motherfuckin' toes 'cause he super
Only given code to 'em, fuck if they use to
Nigga be denyin' the abuse they allude
I refuse to believe in the booth
I'm like Eminem, a nigga needed a proof
I didn't need a ceilin', but I needed a roof
Need some penicillin, niggas sick with the lies
Shit thick in disguise, know I needed the truth

Know it got 'em feelin' a way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way, way
I don't never speak too lose
Heard they like to keep two truths and a lie
I don't think I can trust in the troops
Know it got 'em feelin' a way

Look
I know you can't heal in a day
Know it's too much real in the way
Soon as we touch down, cotton field's in the way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way, way
I know this shit still here today
Stay on point, that's a spearheaded way
Flow like water, we'll never liquidate
Metal Gear Solid, they appear with the snakes
No way (No way)
No way (No way)
No way (No way)
No way, no way, no way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way
No way (No way)

Divided by the quotation, that's the truth

// 10 Gallons //

[Mick Jenkins:]
And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just
I ain't ever

[Zac Flewids:]
Look at how a death affects you
Now I got two straps, ambidextrous
Homie got blew back now I'm next up
Mick and I two step, straightened your chest out
I been inside of the kitchen
I don't need any permission
Unless shawty tryna' get pipe
'Cause that be my bitches decision
I don't want no Margiela or Balenci's
You could not offend me
You could only push me to the edge and find lead from the end of my 50
Bitch I'm with the wind, see
Pop a motherfucker like Jones no Quincy, ugh
I been on the hunt for the Benjies, bruh
'Cause every thing that glitter lets me feel it in my soul
Big bro got popped and I pray for his soul
I feel less human when I sit back and morn
But it makes me feel something
I'm little bit torn on the topic
Corn on the cob
When you flow I'm appalled, homie stop it
Apostle of God with a god complex and I know y'all mother fuckers catch these optics
These op-op

[Mick Jenkins:]
And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away

[Zac Flewids:]
And I'm back with a black mask
Anybody tryna brah-brah take a cat nap
I don't want to take another tablet of acid
I don't want to have another panic and flash back
Blood's thicker than water
I starved with my men, now we split up the lotto
And I could never cave, take a bitch to the grotto
And fuck 'til my dick hurt
"Distract me" is my motto
False loyalty to people
Where reciprocation is weak
My seven deadly sins, might occupy the whole week
I felt I owed her my life
For helping when I O.D
'Til Cherry told me "homie, you would do the same shit for me"
And that's true as fuck
My bitch green obsessed but got the bluest blood
And my burgundy soul's polysporin in the cut
And the water of the womb grows thinner than the blood
Spark up the cannabis
Bitch I'm intimate
I don't feel shit since bro got killed
And all of these pills really helping me handle it

Drop dead weight, it's water
Keep me away from the alter
My body is morphing and changing a lot
But my soul is the part that dont alter
Drop dead weight, it's water
Keep me away from the alter
My body is public and up for the taking
My soul is the part I don't offer

[Mick Jenkins:]
And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away

And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away

// Action Figures //

Yeah, days get longer when the same shit brought up
Summer lasts forever if you sleeping through autumn
I'm posted on a Cumulus cloud
Got the .311's, lethal weapon
Everybody sucks in this fucking town, yeah
At least the blunt flavored
Life gets slower when there's no more party favors
Action figures don't cut it anymore
Need a bitch with a credit score higher than my own, I should listen more
It's all about respect, my homie put me on a cast like I broke my fucking neck
It's like Christmas in the sunshine
Rеmember no money, all thе lunch lines
Fun times, it was never funny, never punchlines
This a dissertation, and a thesis
Doing nothing always, that's my DNA sequence
Have my goodbyes memorized in case I end up leaving
Got a prior engagement, I guess I'll see you on the weekend, yeah

We don't always see sunshine like this
Pull up on my people I'm like
That's the hood, you never find no ethos quite like this
Never really see no limelight
We don't always see sunshine like this
Like this, like this, like this
We don't always see sunshine like this
Like this, like this, like this

Yeah, I'm in NYC when it's 90 degrees
It's like every day was one less reason to live
I was a good kid doing bad shit
Stories so tragic, I'm better 'cause it happened
Pass out on the pavement, forget what today is
Only thing that matters in the end is your name and where you stationed
I never seen a sun like this
We got the steaks on the grill while you sip on a drink
It's been a minute since I been around
Come to feeling like you're different
But I can't put my finger on the difference
Getting looks when I'm back in town
Out of place when I'm in it, I'm admitting that I miss it
But I hate the fact I'm gone for like most of the year
And I never tend to call all those moments of me
But fuck what I've been thinking, it's a type of day you should've stayed inside for
The type of day you pray for sunshine and gettin' high for, yeah

We don't always see sunshine like this
Pull up on my people I'm like
That's the hood, you never find no ethos quite like this
Never really see no limelight
We don't always see sunshine like this
Like this, like this, like this
We don't always see sunshine like this
Like this, like this, like this

// Aurora Borealis //

Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there
... Uh
... Wooo

Talk proper, settled at the baritone
Got the Gilroy, tried to hit her with the pheromones (pheromones)
Like a phoenix, young dust out the ashes in a three quarter jacket
It was fleece, it was Aaron Boone
Creep, plus she don't roll with the sheep, beep beep
I'm like "Ma, I got keys to the Jeep"
Got water for your chocolate, I got trees for the leaf
Got posies for your pockets when it all falls down, it's back to basics
I rolled a joint, she was stressing
White tee and some denim, she been distressing for weeks
It look better after she wash 'em suppose
I would give her this old, wrapped in all these instrumentals is intentions and goals
Purified through the water, glorified through the gold
Look through the glory hole and you can see that we fucked so suck it up
We spreading love, I could never give enough, give it up
Spreading love, I could never give enough, uh

Girl I had to let you know (had to let know)
Before you go, I see the glow (girl you got the glow)
You be the light (girl you got the glow)
You be the light
I just had to take the time (had to take the time)
Before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (You stay on my mind, running through my mind)
Girl I had to let you know
Before you go, I see the glow (had to let you know before I had to let you go)
You be the light
You be the light (girl you know you shining, girl you know, you know you glow)
I just had to take the time before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (No, no, no, no, no)

All the time like, 24/7 like, 365 like
Might go 9/11 when we fly low, all under the radar
Fully in command like the space next to the space-bar on a Macbook, I don't play y'all
Down like your baby mom supposed to
Then they come around, they'll never come close to postal
I done been around the world, same Tofu everywhere
Girl you more than rare
Appreciation for that fact, know there's no shortage here I...
I was looking at you, you... wondering when
We can make it a we, we... tell me if that ain't cool
I was just tryna see, see... I noticed your glow
And for me it was blinding I mean, I ain't icing out the Audemar or nothing but for me it was timing and that's...
And that's, all the time like, 24/7 like, 365 like
Might go 9/11 when we fly low (fly low, fly low, fly low)

That's why I had, to let you know, oh, oh
That's why I had, to let you know

Girl I had to let you know (had to let know)
Before you go, I see the glow (girl you got the glow)
You be the light (girl you got the glow)
You be the light
I just had to take the time (had to take the time)
Before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (You stay on my mind, running through my mind)
Girl I had to let you know
Before you go, I see the glow (had to let you know before I had to let you go)
You be the light
You be the light (girl you know you shining, girl you know, you know you glow)
I just had to take the time before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no!

Who Goddamn bang
Who-who-who-who
G-G-G-Goddamn
Bang-bang-bang
Who Goddamn bang
Who Goddamn Goddamn bang bang
Who who Goddamn bang
BOB [x6]

How fast do your feet move?
When that banger on your ass, how fast do your feet move?
Bob! Nigga, I'm gone
Focused on threats, I ain't watching no throne
I ain't focused on checks, just the craft that I own
Til the whole ship rock, like I put it on stone
In the wrong neighborhood full of folks that are knowns
Where your pockets get tapped, like we put em on phones
You ain't getting that back, we ain't taking no loans
Fuck you thought it was?
Like a Jeep, we need everything free
But you never think cheap
When you thought of us
Niggas wanna be the goat, but these hoes go ghost
We like nope, hope you only think sheep
When you thought of us
Hope you never think sleep, we creep
Probably pull one of your Little Bo Peeps, if she BOB that bap
If she BOB that back, gone

[Hook x2:]
Who Goddamn bang
Who-who-who-who
G-G-G-Goddamn
Bang-bang-bang
Who Goddamn bang
Who Goddamn Goddamn bang bang
Who who Goddamn bang
BOB [x6]

All around the city they working
Screaming, "Who Goddamn Bangz?"
Little nigga got it tucked in his jeans
It's these little niggas got it stuck in their brains, shoot
Pull the trigger til the shit is empty, recoup
If a yellow line nigga out the loop
Man the truth be the shit, for the soul
Add some soop, or a shoe
If you kick with the pros in the booth, like, BOB
Bang like, bang at the ops
All up in the trains, hitting stains at the stops
Strays with the frame in the picture, get cropped
It's a little girl, don't expect her to stop in the bigger world
Bang, all of your dreams
Me and my team came after your cream
Caught all of your hoes, then slaughtered your bros
My nigga, we banged all over your scene, BOB

[Hook x2:]
Who Goddamn bang
Who-who-who-who
G-G-G-Goddamn
Bang-bang-bang
Who Goddamn bang
Who Goddamn Goddamn bang bang
Who who Goddamn bang
BOB [x6]

[Dally Austin:]
Who Goddamn bangz, my nigga?
Feet so fast, when I [?], little nigga
Don't hang like, nah little nigga, don't bang
Slang, little gotta get paid
No job, but bills to be paid
Story of a nigga self made
Dreams of the guns go bang, tell her bob that bap
Bitches be gone, til I run in they home
Niggas is wilding, not taking no fault
Do your feet move when that gun at your dome, in my city?
You are not safe in your home
I'm a gangster granddad, and I'm proud of it
Getting rich or die, dying in the plans somewhere
Do you bang to the beat? Niggas bang to the streets
On the mic, I bang
Kill em all, I pray
BOB

[Hook x2:]
Who Goddamn bang
Who-who-who-who
G-G-G-Goddamn

// Bruce Banner //

I'm not a rapper, I'm a writer
It's a couple chefs in this game, and a whole lotta' biters
Fuck's wrong with these niggas
Fuck's to it
Fuck wrong wit' 'em
Fuck's to it
These niggas talker not walkers
The drive of Paul Walker, I got it
Can't touch 'em, like, now that I'm sipping this Henny Hypnotic
Fuck wrong wit' 'em
Fuck's to it (uh!)

Honestly can't nobody come for me 'cept Kendrick
And I hope you offended, like it's untrue
Don't make me debunk your kung-fu
Fuck up the whole Feng shui when we come through
They can't hurt us
My shit in Target, I'm Nate Burkus, they ain't perfect
Can she walk out with the javelin
Y'all niggas babbling about who the greatest and who after him
If intelligent discussion was dribbling, you'd be travelling
And I'd be somewhere Harlem Globetrot traffickin' truth
I'm adamant about the handle I got on this shit
I pattened it after James Harden and James Patterson
Don't make me Alex Cross, cross 'tween, skip through that lane and change strategy (uh!)
Niggas lose medullas, fuckin' with my shooters
Rappers lose medallions fuckin' with Chicago
So many niggas hangin', they know Mr. Cooper
Police they are shooters then like bloopers
They gon' play that shit on T.V., 'til we Stevie to it
Say we can't make them drink the water
I don't know if we can lead 'em to it
I see the difference, I don't see improvement
I see people that look like me that's leeching to it
And apparently speaking on it is preaching to 'em
And apparently having opinions is tragic to mention, no matter intention
But only when you got blue checks and new checks and a few floors, more than a duplex
I'm too stressed for all this, fifth-grade, bitch-made
Watch your mouth when you spit facts, what for?
I got the fire nigga
Heard 'Soul album and I knew that I inspire niggas greatly
Alex Hailey at the root of it all
My quest-for-love just wasn't suited for ya'll and my black thoughts won't be muted or diluted
And livin' water can't be polluted at all
Secluded I be, too many delusions I see when you speaking and you losin' me
That's your 15 minutes, you losin' 'em
They draw their conclusions
I just be just disproving 'em, my ink hold weight
This paper hold heat like aluminum foil
Your correct in assuming the soil is fertile
I'm growing like weeds, I'm growing my weed
My shorty look like she come from where they growing ya'll weave at
Ya'll throwing shade, I three-man weave that
It's been a one-man fast break, ya'll ain't even seen the team yet

Fuck wrong wit' 'em
Fuck's to it
Fuck wrong wit' 'em
Fuck's to it
These niggas talker not walkers
The drive of Paul Walker, I got it
Can't touch 'em, like, now that I'm sipping this Henny Hypnotic
Fuck wrong wit' 'em
Fuck's to it (uh!)

[Mick Jenkins:]
Pay me no mind, I'm doing fine
I caught a vibe, I
Might do my thing, I'm finna slide
I'll be alright
Nigga just move lowkey
Motherfuckers don't know me
Motherfuckers can't hold me
Far back, I'm back in the front row
All different kind of floor seats
All different kind of mobs too
We ain't got too many opps tho
Not too many different colours with us
You can visualize it like a Ralph coat
Shop with niggas like it's Costco
Motherfuckers like to buy in bulk
We've been buying black
And we bought folk
We ain't do it for the hand clap
Motherfuckers get teed off the green
Fall right into a sand trap
We ain't even out the woods yet
Just stepped out the crib
Some of the Ojoe fresh good shit
I've been off the back wood shit
Feel like all my grass greener now
Tell these niggas start watching they own shit
Yeah I'm Anakin now, they panicking now
Attack of the clone shit
Who really want smoke
I'm giving out bong hits
Got them taking the long way to the crib
Broke neck, that head in the phone shit
Both legs, I'm pulling my own weight
Bowl legged as crooked as I could allow you to be
I don't play with that phony shit
Don't play with that two day homie shit
Play like it's a two-way contract
Everyday nigga my jacket don't only zip
Take it off and I'm throwing fits
Chi town nigga, bout cold as shit
Pay me no mind

[Masego:]
Where he from
(Chi town, chi town, chi town)
Birth year
(91, 91, 91)
Where he at
(There he go, there he go, there he go)
Got em like
(Who)
Got em like
(Ah)
We lowkey
(Winning)
On God
(Ask the woman)
Endlessly
(Well rested)
Always been cool
Always been fly

// Chicago //

So, I figure I should tell you a little bit about myself
Since you don't really know, anything, about much at all, that's what I'll do
Gather round children

I grew up round them white kids first, Paranoid like a crack head
A blemish in they world, yea, I was just a black head
Proactive, they put me with them smarter kids, I didn't care
I was just mad that I was the darkest kid with thick hair
And they stared, like I was not suppose to be in there
I grew up, mama living like Kadeisha and miss Sinclair
That's single, she didn't like to mingle with her kids there
And when they tried to woo we brought the Whoo! like Rick Flair
No chin hair, what was I eleven nigga?
And that's when you decided that yo kids would come second nigga?
Just barely walking and you still just kept it stepping nigga?
Now that's some sick shit, what is you a leper nigga?
See that's the type of shit that make not respect a nigga
Just know the debt you owe is looking real hefty nigga
Nah, I ain't mad, I just said that for the record nigga
Nah, I ain't mad I just said that for the record nigga
But I digress and reminisce on days after he left us
When honey buns and flaming hots was healthy breakfast
When micros and kinky twists gave hell to edges
And them girls in your class started wearing heels and wedges, ahhhh
Sounds good don't it?
I know somebody out there like "it sound hood homie"
But the hood was all we had, and we made good from it
Especially them D-boys, I know they made good money
Made good dummies, start selling that wet work
Cause we see them stacking paper like cubical desk work
They see through like wet shirts
They grandmamma chest hurt
Her heartbroken, cause the streets done got up in 'em
They rocked the uniform: white tee, 5 pocket denim
Nikes, no clocking in
But they working that nine to five
High key they don't know better, buy trees
And go and choke like rabbit first time at the shelter, I see
A people stuck in they ways, no it's not just a phase
They see a future in tomorrow, they are stuck in a daze
And I am fucking amazed
At how these wack niggas spit the way they Dunkin is glazed
See that's sweet nigga
But I got it hot and ready for the street nigga
Your soul starving, so I prepared you a feast nigga
So get them headphones to your ears, and eat nigga
I'm vegetarian, but it is full of meat nigga
I'm trying to take it cross country, track meet nigga
Then hit the mall like I'm hitting athlete figures
I actually figured, that I'd be harder than this
I'm just warming up, but they say that I'm sautering this
I think I'm fathering this, my seed come through the pen
I'm trying to bust in another life I ain't fucking no bitch
And I can't fuck with no snitch
Keep my name out your fucking mouth
Unless you talking bout me, or sucking this dick, aww
I try to let this beat fade like newly washed denim
But got on my Scrappy Doo, just "let me back at 'em "
I'm trying to know this game, just (uh), let me back catch 'em
Just let me direct 'em, like traffic lights
And I'm a take 'em higher, much higher than your average flight
And give 'em mouthfuls much bigger than your biggest bite
And show 'em how I'm much flyer than your average kite
And now they grabbing tight
But I'm just picking them off me
Writing these death certificates, Killing them softly

// Code Green //

Money on my mind but those thoughts are fleetin'
Just a papercut but feel like I can't stop the bleedin'
100 flows fool, cruella couldn't spot my ceilin'
And I'm Spock with speakin'
Came with pro tools, no logic leakin'
I know the offense come from proper defense
Been breakin' patterns, know they lost the sequence
The last of somethin' we just not Mohicans
The first of nothin' we just got the blueprints
They way we comin' we'll have multiverses by the weekend
On to the new shit by the time the news hit
I take the old chips and buy the new dip
This shit is surfboard its not a cruise ship
The Open Sea just some deep blue shit
At foundation I found patience
I found actors no sound stages
Who okay'd to fake it till' you make it?
I can't take it, gotta remember this shit just the Matrix
Cant get complacent, had a mask on but I had to face it
AHHH

Illusion is my world
It soothes the strain
And moves me on
The truth is my alter ego
No fault in being honest
Honest honest honest

Boot up by my bootstraps, these avatar heels
Got me runnin around for new laps,
Like did anybody get through that?
Who got the plug, I am the plug
Unplug me for a minute G
I got the disks and all the games the players on this grid could need
Please, Breath
Or these things you want are truly what you need
See look the code is green
My bands are broad my land is odd it's in the metaverse
But I've been runnin round in cyber circles just to stretch the Hertz
Connect to church so we can praise the gods
My net worth is hogtied to horseshit don't step in dirt
I got some problems that I've yet to search
Solutions downloadin' in severed verse
If you can see these walls then get the clerk
They'd want us down here kept and hurt
And extra burnt no lessons learned no blessing birthed
I'm tryna find myself in terabytes of terrorism
Eccentric exorcisms Saturation heads are spinnin'
This consciousness is just a weathered prison
YUH

Illusion is my world
It soothes the strain
And moves me on
The truth is my alter ego
No fault in being honest
Honest honest honest
Honest honest honest

[Mick Jenkins:]
Pop the collar on my polo like I thought of that
Only ride with Thoroughbreds like we was playing polo
Fuck Shapiro, that's not just for promo
Pull up on your whole squad dolo
Not in a Wraith just in this Raf Simons
And ain't my pace, I know my cash different
Rap niggas smile in your face, then act different
I can't call it, shit
But I'm too deep in my wallet to but that deep in those feelings
See no ceilings when I look up
Etch A Sketch flows got Chicago shook up
Take note! The trees [?] and when I cook like I don't need a apron
Don't want no smoke, they blowin' smoke, man, all I see is vape pens
Bitch, really, it's truth, now, can I get a Amen?
Come through flossing like your pastor on Easter
Keep the sauce in Alabaster box, your stamp's in my visa
Cramps in my fingers and this scheme on my Visa
My pass as the Shiba
We rollin' raw, it's never Swisher Sweets
We don't do Swisher Sweets

[Calez:]
Cooling, smoking, there he go
Wait, I'm cool, outspoken, very woke
I read the scenario: She try and milk my account just for them Cheerios
That dairy feta
Yeah, that's why I met her on Ontario
I bury treasure
Bought a pair of these, these not no Perry Ellis
Katy Perry, sippin' on dark horse
My bitch took off them leathers, she gon' shake it
(She gon' shake it, she gon' shake it)
We gon' get off together
This ain't no movie scene, but bring a extra
Now, here's a lecture: y'all can't fuck with my texture
This for those out there that think y'all blocking my blessings
Young black boy from the bottom, I should cover essence
I was sick and stressing, so I just started finessing
Yeah, cooling, smoking, there I go
I can barely even smoke in peace, they watch me everywhere I go
You say you love me, yeah, I know
You don't love me yet until you show me where that money at (yeah)

// Crossroads //

[Mick Jenkins:]
Started from the bottom of the map
Move to the Chi like fifth grade
Running like the water from the tap
Move with a mind like what switch blades see
I ain't never been the type of nigga that'd change with the fame, you could put it in quotes
Been down to ride for my niggas had pegs, on a Mongoose sitting on spokes
Handcuffs sitting on the peanut butter loaves
Living on the rim of the glass of the water
Don't you see people out here pimping your hope
Living on a whim, lower class getting slaughtered, killed
Niggas in the streets on the pipe no kilt, it's a skirt motherfucker you know it
Pull the triggers to the beats
Taking lives, no guilt
Got the summer feel like it's snowing, cold
Shoulders, murders, mowed us down
Damn, you could tell these niggas need a drink
Sun get hotter streets get colder, damn
You could tell these niggas need a drink
Spit his flow like is coming up the sink
And the shit hot like it's coming in the mink
Never dumb it down, make a dumb nigga think
Ginger in his tea make a dumb nigga drink
Grippin your heart and grippin your soul
Grippin that iron, I'm dropping that zinc
Gotta move smart I didn't learned from the dope
Just what I'm gonna do, with the coke and the ink
Like oh no, they locked a nigga up for smoking purple
I'm free, I'm screaming, "free my niggas" 'til the world blow
I'm screaming "free my niggas" 'til the world blow
Save Money she gonna do it for the free

[Chance The Rapper:]
She gonna do it for the freak
Dinner reservations with a Navajo
Indian in her family like a lot of hoes
Lot of hoes done said they was not a ho
Now the Leprechauns done lied about they pot'o'gold
I'm bout my green like an avocado guacamole
I'm from the Chi, she say she shy but she gotta go
Prodigal
Solid gold
Chains bought from college shows
Staying out in Hollywood
Wayne out of Hollygrove
Kamikaze comma Common Keef and ComicCon
Ye and me and King L Katie here's a comet coming
Kamehameha, Chi may have made a spirit bomb
Here's a ton of acid, ready for it here it comes,
(WOOOOO!)
Uh, I'm just having fun with it
Vic just brought the beef up, Mick just brought a gun with it
You think you could stomach it?
Umf, tummy ache
All you did was shadow box
All you did was run in place
Started from the middle of the class, multi-entendre
And now I can do what I wanna
Shouts out Shetandra and Shando, shouldn't have shined a light on me

[Vic Mensa:]
Staring at the bottom of the bottle
Pour it out for the fam take the shots
In the land, shoot first think last that's the motto
Money on my mind
Mega Millions on the rise, scratch off like I'm tryna win the lotto
Lot of baller niggas done lied about their jump shots
Tryna play the shooter 'til they shot him (pow)
Got 'em (pow pow)
Shoes off and kick up my feet
Talk dirty, never brush my teeth
Tell em I'm Rosa Parks, they can suck my seed
I ain't giving up my seat
Saw my face through the stain glass window in church
Demons in the night when I sleep
Stole the collection cash out the pastor's purse
Gave it to a bum to get something to eat
Paper twistin, bend it backwards
Flip the script, dyslexic actors
Atom smashing, passing, bombing, writing it off my taxes
Uncle Sam done put a deficit on my debit card
Me, Mick Jenkins and Chancelor, chances are you no competitor
(OnGaud my nigga)

// Designer Frames //

Thousand dollars Cazals, Fear of God on my feet
How I walk in his footsteps, ain't walk to the beat?
How I tell 'em I'm flat-footed but stay on my toes?
Peep the shit with my left eye and stay on my creep, they can't stand on my flows
Lotta heads in the clouds
We was bobbin' our heads to your style 'fore you was born
Niggas want us like, "Wow, I can't go for the fade"
'Less you talking 'bout the olive green tint on my shades
These thousand dollars Cazals, frame of mind is the same
I was blessed to know on some niggas who would study the game
Who would give me some game
And they swear a nigga changed 'cause he spendin' some change
But the closest to me know we ain't just 'posed to stay the same
I can give a fuck bein' frank, I be laughin' like I'm off the Novacane
Hold the weight of the team
I might have to do like Kap or grab a cane
All the pain we ascertain from chocolate rain and acid rain, I need the sunshine
I bought these glasses, tryna rock 'em for the one time
The climate changed in December, feel like the summertime
The silence hangs in the air, the truth is underlined
Ain't no different through these thousand dollars Cazals
[?] in the clutch, another rack on my back
It's not to say you ain't up, but dawg I know you ain't up
These niggas off the caffeine, I only read in between
I mean I seen what I seen, these thousand dollars Cazals
Barely noticed the shade, I'm only playin' my hand
I mean a spade is a space, I flopped the nuts and I'm paid
Tell these neutered niggas, I ain't hearin' nothin' they say
Shit is deeper than rap, shit is deeper than skin
You'd see it if I was [?]
You get too deep with the pen and start sayin', "Behave"
I'm in too deep, no Cool J
Don't want 'em callin' me God, I can't keep up with the [?]
Nigga I'm just a man, Louis pouch in my hand
[?] there's parmesan in my pockets
I know the jacket was lamb and I got the top from Japan
Harmonizing with wifey, yeah, that was always the plan
And I see it happening through thousand dollars Cazals

// Elephant In The Room //

(Uh!)

The elephant remembers it all
Down to irrelevant
The regimen, a journey that slightly resembles the revenant
The valley of the shadow of death
Maleficent energy prevalent
Cautious, not hesitant
I'm no average bum
Not Travis Gumbs but I know street etiquette
Don't be negligent
I found this knowledge, no prerequisite
Shoutout to feminists, the real ones
All the others is enemies
It's evident, niggas ain't swimming with me in my element
These lyin' niggas Ryan Lochte
I'm more Michael Phelps with it
A bit more eloquent
A better temperament
A different thermostat
I'm learning that I tell the truth and they gon do me like Kaepernick
Got it burning up
Just some hebrew boys thrown in the Furnace you can turn it up
Then we multiply step out draped in
Decadence black excellence
Edified exercised then eat my vegetables
If food for thought was vegetables
Then you gotta know it be pesticides
Revolution won't be televised
They want all my niggas pacified paralyzed
Can't plead the fifth
Jumping out the plane no parachute
Just faith I see the sith Annakin
With the eager risk
Building off this water on some beaver shit
You know who to leave it to flows sound like
He don't know what's 10 and 2
And shit is just begining to take shape
Niggas get bitter as grapefruit
But couldn't hold the pen
After shakeweight for 2 months
Some say I'm too blunt
Couldn't give two fucks under the same weight
Would crumble like blue cheese
Crumbling blue dream
I need like a QP for the month and some octane my pony
I roll up under tints and I hotboy by my lonely
Islands that I got flown to
I wrote them bars off a stoney remember
Remember us hella bent remember
Remember like elephants
Remember

// Fate //

Dabs of the shatter
Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
Same old shit like the same drawers
Who knew that shoulders could be this cold
I, told her holler when the pain thaws
Low key it wasn't indoor
I was rolling chemdawg
She was off the menthols
Please, we were not on the same plateau
She be much more than an alto
Shawty had few pheromones for this baritone harboured lies
So we couldn't harmonise at all

Face it lady we weren't meant to be
Basically I'm tryna set you free
I know, I know
I told you I won't let you go
I know, I know
Didn't wanna feel like that no more
I know, I know
I just might miss you when you gone

Dabs of the shatter
Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
Same old shit like the same drawers
Didn't give a fuck, them panties came off regardless
We already naked baby, why so cautious?
Throw it to the wind so often
We be playing it safe from changing the pace
It's the only canvas we could paint and erase
Drop lines with my fingers I could trace to your soul
Then like a trachea broke we on our lungs bruh
How do we breathe under water?

Face it lady we weren't meant to be
Basically I'm tryna set you free
I know, I know
I told you I won't let you go
I know, I know
Didn't wanna feel like that no more
I know, I know
I just might miss you when you gone

// FreeNation Rebel Soldier Pt. 2 //

I promise you the waters is coming
Saying it everyday got me feeling like Noah
They say I'll blow up
My aunts and uncles see me rapping
They say I'll grow up
Some stop and stare like how he still a vegetarian with all this good meat that he throw up?
Trust I'm a Show up when it's show time
Running threw the field like dion sannders with four primes
We need mo primes
Where the fuck is megatron when you fighting lions?
Tellem whatever they selling nigga I ain't buying!
The world been coming to an end and I ain't need no Mayan calendar to feel that
Got the people rooting for the waters like Phil back with a younger Kobe
Young shin obi
Nigga moving through the shadows of the city got no hittaz but the youngins know me
Took some good advice from a couple og's
Shared the knowledge with my homies we ain't talking for the hell of it
It was always bout the growth and development
Never to big
Elephant in the room how could you not notice?!
Can't you smell when I'm cooking this rock?!
Dwayne Johnson with the raw
Stuff the cash in my sock!
Ain't tryna live life to BIG it might stop
Stay Ready to die am I PAC?!
Holograms of the southside
I be blessed just to make it back to my spot!
Steppin over squares like hopscotch I'm top notch
Got hands like doc OC
It's a wonder that he don't write more
More fire for the water to be boiled get impurities out
Make sure he sure what he bout
Betta know what yo security bout
I'm here to cure any doubt that you may have had bout the kid in the leather boots
Bottle water and a ginger root hella vegetables
Tommy bag full of Cole/coal and you know what pressure do
A flawed diamond still impeccable

A flawed diamond still impeccable

Why is it so hard to grasp that concept
Why the simple shit on the cover of complex?
Nigga look around!
Can't elevate If you keep looking down
Don't let the pennies ever make you proud
Keep it Blunt with how he break it down
Bring it to you naked how can you hate on that
Ring the alarm everybody slept late on that
Next best out the chi and I ain't really leaving room for debate on that

// Frontstreet //

Aye, put me on
Put me on
Put me on

Aye, put me on frontstreet
We done did enough sneaking through the back door
We done grew enough roses from concrete
I done stamped up two whole passports
I done hopped in my motherfuckin' Jansport
Niggas grown till it's time to communicate
Niggas grown till it's time to apologize
Niggas smoke like you trying to fumigate shit
You know roaches will live through anything
I thought vultures would wait till a nigga die
These birds can't wait till a nigga breathe
Swear to god I hate when a nigga lie
Especially when I gave you my energy
Can't rent space in my head, tryna enterprise
New whip, butterfly tryna pollinate
Bi-coastal, the truth tend to polarize
I find globally lies tend to dominate shit
Gotta say it to my face when you come in mine
Gotta put it in the air if you blowing smoke
Better win a Golden Globe if you running lines
Running deep, got layers like artichoke
Check it, don't speak on my name if you summarize
Came way too far, you gotta say it all
Didn't wear it on the surface, it was underlined
These days gotta put me on frontstreet
No cut scenes, just the one-shot
Call it Clifford, got the red in the front seat
And the loud turn heads like a gunshot
Bullshit stop flows like a blood clot
No, I don't stretch my stories, no bungee
Break bread when a nigga, get hungry
We can all ride like I'm in the humvee

Doubt that, nigga, put me on frontstreet
We done did enough sneaking through the back door
We done grew enough roses from concrete
I done stamped up two whole passports
I done hopped in my motherfuckin' Jansport
Niggas grown till it's time to communicate
Niggas grown till it's time to apologize
Niggas smoke like you trying to fumigate shit
You know roaches will live through anything
I thought vultures would wait till a nigga die
These birds can't wait till a nigga breathe
These niggas let a whole groupo of kids die
Government can't tell me anything
Bitch look straight in my face then tell a lie
Think I'm gon' give up my energy
But you no longer dealing with beginner me
These days gotta put me on frontstreet

(These niggas let a whole group of kids die)
Gotta put me on frontstreet
(Bitch look straight in my face and tell a lie)
Aye, put me on
(But you no longer dealing with beginner me)
Put me on
Frontstreet

// Gimme Space //

Yeah, I don't think you really who you say you is
You ain't really who you, who you say you is
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know
Look, If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma make it then
If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma gimme, gimme
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know

Before I caught a red eye, you could bet I caught a black one
You bring them toys out, better not be no cap gun
This ain't IG, niggas wanna expose your heart, they just gon' tap once
There ain't no Maybelline for make believe
My barber took a vaca, you could still come catch a fade with me
I'm Coach K. on bad days
I make the call, you wait and see
I'm not at all coy, I'm James Fauntleroy in rooms with ya'll noise
Step in that bitch, like what's the call boys?
Lil' niggas want buzz so bad, they drinkin' tall boys
I put my shooters on, ya'll can't assist me
Chris Paul voice
Pistol Pete of grippin' pens
I ain't ever aim and miss
I ain't know what famous is
I'll show ya'll what dangerous is
Niggas tried to take my life
Then they want to take a flick
I ain't even lace my kicks
Still made triple threat movements
My stutter step got 'em sweatin', don is a threat to 'em
My bread and butter bring envy, hunger and stress to 'em

Yeah, I don't think you really who you say you is
You ain't really who you, who you say you is
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know
Look, If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma make it then
If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma gimme, gimme
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know

These niggas done pissed me off
I'm off the top with all my moves
See any nigga actin' hard, I bet the iron switch him soft
I switch the safety off
Spit 32, he caught a mean one
Trigger finger crazy wild, the witness say she heard machine guns
Now we playin quidditch

I'm trying to catch a snitch
Fuck a cat and mouse I'm at this bitch
Don't run your mouth bout Mick
I'm from out south, I made it out that shit
22 in this Gucci pouch, you think my outfit slick
Goofy, now gimme the loose-leaf or you lose your coofie
Don't act fishy unless you raw as sushi
This ain't the movies but
Shit get spooky, I call slime ghoulie
Pull up with the tooly
Turn your fruits to smoothies
Double back and turn your smoothie soupy
Same shit over and over, all you niggas loopy
My eyes be on the skies, I feel like Snoopy
Told my homie scoop me, pulled up in a hoopty
Pulled up on some monkeys
I be with gorillas like a fuckin' zoo
Keep bitches bad and boujee
Niggas tame but still unruly
You could fuckin' sue me
And you will
When a off-duty shoot me 'cause he moody
And it's truly hate

// Got Me Like //

Every day, keep on analyzing
Every day, keep me satisfied and I know
I can be wrong but you move in silence
I can be wrong but you keep denying

Tell me what I want to know
Don't leave me alone
Don't run away my love

Yeah, you got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (La)
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)

Just like nicotine, you're a fiend fiend
How you leave when I'm all you need?
Honestly, got me tripping, falling super speed
Would you listen? Got me begging, please, but

Would you love me, would you let it go?
Would you love me if nobody knows, knows, knows?
Nowhere to go, go, go, go, go, go

You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
You got me like, you got me like
You got me like, you got me like
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (La)
(La, la, la, la, la)

Uh, uh
Pistol whip-like grip that shit is tight, you caught me slipping
Just complete the mission, I was not supposed to stay
Still the fastest break, a nigga appetite, it's different
Thought that I might call, I didn't know what the fuck to say
Usually speak in sway, you spoke in my tune
I was so amazed, I was running away
That shit was tsunami, kamikaze, I deplane
No you not insane, I just can't explain

You got me like, la, la, la, la, la
(I just can't explain)
La, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
(You got me like)
(You got me like, you got me like, you got me like)
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
(Mm, la, la, la)

// Halo //

Come from a higher place
Come from a higher place

Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive
Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive

Thought I had it all in a bag, thought I had it all in a plan
More like twist and turn when the flow would bend
I feel like I'm 'bout to flip in that whip switch hands
And I can only help myself, hope you understand

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind

I treat Brooklyn like Bethlehem
Bridgetown is Nazareth
They wanna send me Jerusalem
But I'm on some other shit
Cash on that Methuselah
Shawty she servin' Medusa looks
You claim that you damaged, there's two of us
So hope I can bandage your wound
Man, they can't handle the truth
Life is attached to the tomb
Tapped in but I'm trapped in the coupe
Strapped in but the ride was nice
Hit the club on a Friday night
Yeah the vibe was ight but I'd rather shoot
Kick a vibe in my avenue
I like the view from this altitude

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind

I put the Gucci with the Fubu did the [?]
Out in paris stuck in traffic
Had to string the DJ [?] was clownin'
Then I put the crumble in the paper with the flower
We was smokin', we was breathing under water
We was drownin'
Started being honest with myself, the Henny nasty
Switched it for the dulce
Chase it with the agua
That's two cups, keep it classy
I only do the truth say
Put that on my momma, trust me I can feel the hate
I feel that fake ass energy these niggas seal they fate
They switch the style to match the scene on some chameleon shit
You catching me with silicon it's more Chamillionaire
We buildin' up, it's no more ceilings here

Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive
Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
I'll place a halo, I'll place

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind

// How I Am //

How you gonna move when it's time to sign that dotted line
And you're no longer able to speak your mind
Fix your shit
Spend a bit switch your image
Cop a whip maybe a chain or two with the pendants
The rollie compliments it 100k to your dependents
Work through your agreement til you can say you're independent
But please do not get it twisted niggas forget that it ain't that easy
They'll do you greasy then hide their hands the shit is treason
Consecutive W's but executives fucking you
Industry sucking you dry tell me what're we coming to
Disingenuous energy from people you run into you
Cut them off the machine you shut it off
No telling what you'll come across going through the process
To become a boss these day you can't tolerate another loss
Disloyal jewelry your chain came with a double cross
But that don't hide the fact they see you as the underdog
Show them how to make it with art form
All could've been easy now you gotta make it hard for them
Before you leave the world let the people know it's all for them
Time is now either stand for something or you fall for them
Yeah

Ohh this is how I am
Ohh this is who I am

Ayo Keem niggas is looking for you man trying find out where the fuck you at
The fuck you been doing man
It's time to get this money nigga the fuck off your ass

I evolve
Never tried to hide my flaws
In this game you sink or swim
Fly or fall
Every bars a fire ball
Still cold enough to send a chill through your spinal cord
I'm the one the youngins and OGs get excited for
Power right inside my palm
This atomic penmanship enables me to write a bomb
Drop a song and wipe them all out
Long before the day they even see my final form
Hell will freeze before I conform high quality I perform
Silent storm how'd I keep it going for so long it's been a minute
Going strong for my niggas holding on by the thinnest piece of rope praying that I don't slip
The ones around me quick to say get a grip if ever I trip
I put my trust in them
Know I got way more than enough to win
This shit a race I'm leaving niggas in the dust again
A rush of wind when I get started
Promise I'll stay on it for my dearly departed they said I got it
But my shoulder bout as cold as my heart
I ain't felt love in half a decade
Headaches from stressing over my next phase in life
Same story I'm just working on my next page
The paper looking longer than an essay
Meanwhile I'm praying that all of my people make it in the best way
And live to talk about it the next day
Life is like a chess game
Say less more work less play
Constantly making sure that my head straight
Niggas be deadweight and bitches be deadweight
Everybody trying to get a piece of your bread wait
Once I hit the stage you gone see how this leg break
The whip got leg space
I left space in search of fresh state of mind

Ohh this is how I am
Ohh this is who I am

Aye
This truth still smoking
Chop the onion ain't no tears flowing
That dog in him he got years on them
That frog in him catch me in traffic
No hog in me y'all speak pig latin
That smog in me I still breathe easy speak easy
Moon shining on our wave these niggas drunk early
I'm jack hammered all my flows they seem to crack lately
Pat Swayze dancing dirty then I'm ghost on them
Rearview mirror is broke on them ain't no looking back
Touching souls we not just copping feels
For boutique go to Marshall Fields for department feels
Run a tight ship need loose leaf if you wanna talk for real
Just a young nigga making art for real
Touch a motherfucker heart for real
I pearl some wisdom all we needs a spark for real
No barber pole but shit is getting sharp in here
We cuttin up we know we bout to double up
Buckle up they say it get dark from here

// I Beg To Differ //

They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ

Straight from the mud
But the aim is to sleep like presidents
Come count my momma bills
And you gon' get relevance
Double the hussle, fuck a puzzle
Fuck the starve, this shit is muscles
Need a shovel
Let me show what a blessing is
This shit won't fall from the tress
Hold the torch, got the keys
I need my paper in peace
I like my Mac with the cheese
I need my mans to be free
Life tastes better with some ice to the tea
Fuck a slice, add a cherry, if you bake it for me
Thirsty for water, surrounded by desert eagles
Need to eat, pull the root out, fuck you talking bout evil?
The new pursuit of happiness
Nigga this the sequel
Changed the floor with a kingsizebed
Come let me teach you
Days without a heater
I was bleeding through these speakers
Plus I gotta feed a baby luck ain't never really reached us
Know these gone bill really keep us
Safe from the coldest nights, the older life
Nigga I ain't going back, fuck you talking wrong or right?

They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ
Started getting some change my perspective has changed
Nigga I beg to differ

Tell 'em put that shit where they mouth is
Order your house, fore you start talkin' that fresh shit
We ain't spittin' up mouthwash, we don't need too much vouchin'
Dragons hittin' on my tigers crouch and niggas is low key
That don't mean we ain't pouncin'
Break a pound to the ounces, niggas off of the gram

Get the game of the blouses
Lay in den linens in a Spanish brand I keep mispronouncin'
Think it's Loewe or Loewe, got a show in nueve
And they gon' cash me out as soon as we are exit stage left
This the life that I live, don't miss the one that I left
Don't miss the things that I stressed over what's really distressed
Right up until we finessed, a humble bag, you might hear a brag or two
On point like a dagger - bee, see
How could you quantify advice for my quality of life when
You don't know my pain and dichotomy is strife like
Bill foods wouldn't make the bigger loads 'light' like
Green bags wouldn't have me lean back
Could've had that good food
Could've look like Fat Joe
Couldn't even dream back then
I say broke and think 'bout how I was extrem back then

They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ
Started getting some change my perspective has changed
Nigga I beg to differ

Teach you how to hold the gun
Load that up blow me away

Kill me for all the wrongs that I did to you
We never going back あの Day One
少し cruel

Just kill me baby
Just kill me
償えぬなら Just kill me

Just Kill me baby
Just kill me
I owe you something just kill me

We never going back あの Day one
We never going back

We never going back あの Day one
We never going back

A lot of people like the Minute Maid
Imma take my Country Time, my time not wasted
Cause its spent, I spend some ages on this pen
That's why shit penetrate....
Plenty pages with my sins and them, on stages with my friends and them
New spaces, faces, intentions, I'm... cautious
Gum disease very like flossin, Bumblebees we movin' pollen
Burnin' gas I be exhausted
Wonderin' who you exaltin' with all of that shit you be talkin'
You don't even walk it the same no more, you don't even walk it the same....

A lot of people like the Minute Maid
Imma take my Country Time, my time not wasted
Cause its spent, I spend some ages on this pen
That's why shit penetrate, ventilate, innovate you in the way you appetize
I need a bigger plate
I'm on the road, sleep on the interstate
2 interviews, 2 different clothes
Don't even know what fuckin' day it is

Imma take my Country Time, my time not wasted
Cause its spent, I spend some ages on this pen
That's why shit....
They want my neck, my back, my spine, my money next
Won't get in line, they walk through, think his speech is mine
They call him... Renegade
Had to make a couple bands by my lonely
Had to take a different path than the homies
Had to take my Country Time
Had to taste some humble pie
We was trying to buffet early, like Shoney's
Only islands I knew was Hawaii and Stoney
Nigga had to widen his reach, or just hire a goalie
I'm older and wiser..

(Remember way back...)
Remember way back when I rolled EZ-Widers
Them days is slowly behind us
These days is low key designer
I don't ever really want to blind you with branding
Would you buy it if we hid all the logos?
That type of love take time and attention
Repetition again to the Yo-Yo
No kin to the pollo, these niggas birds
Forget what you heard, get to the pole vault
Raising the bar, they throwing low blows - we hear words
Trying to keep it high def, minds get blurred
Finding the nerve, finding the loot then defining the curse
Finding the truth of the matter disturbed..

A lot of people like the Minute Maid
Imma take my country time, my time not wasted
Cause its spent, I spend some ages on this pen
That's why shit penetrate....
I just want to ventilate...
Feel like what we need is faith...
Imma take my country time, my time not wasted
Cause it's spent....
[fade out repeating]

// Let Go //

Ey, pardon my intrusion
Been hardened by illusion
They've been lying to us
Please, pardon my confusion
I was blind to it
Seems my strings still needed fine tuning
Soiled and now I'm blooming
Let you see that I'm human
Riddled with flaws
But never bear false witness at all
They showed the climb and never mentioned the fall
When deposits start to slow
And you still too quick with withdraws
Sometimes the vision get too long to get solved
With my resolve
Probably spin the block until I evolve
It's time, entry all the doors are revolving
All this noise is revealing
All my choices appealing
I like the ones with no sentence
Didn't have no phone, knew my calling
Most niggas won't know the feeling
Some niggas don't know they hurting
How they know
How they gon' know they need healing
He only know what he heard
He only know what he seen
He try to speak on the both
He end up somewhere between
Nobody else coming close

Nah, nobody else finna ride
But what you fighting inside
Do the best they can by your side
That's just not where shit resides
Nobody else coming close

You say you know what you want
But is what you want what you need
Feels like you missing a piece
Maybe what's missing is me

You say you know what you want
But is what you want what you need
Feels like you missing a piece
Maybe what's missing is me

Your body get comatose
Shit hit like Albert Pujols
Until you lose his new growth
You felt that shit now you know
Tender headed for sure
I used to pull at my curls
It kept my head to the floor
I used to chase after girls
It kept my hands on the door
I used to change for the world
I ain't do that shit no more
Really be on my me shit
Ain't bending over backwards no more
I got the secret all these actors don't know
I just ain't acting more more
I just retracted all the factors
If there ain't no magic, let go
If that ain't felt nobody else coming close

// MOVIN' //

Yeah, uh

Moving with emotion, no force
Wavy like the ocean, of course
Who gave you the notion, I couldn't roll on my own
Had to hop off the wave, learning to float on my own
Copped the boat on my own, verse that I wrote on my own

Just know a nigga place is low-key
No cash or bank statements on me
Good dank, I got it from the homies
No ring get pulled, I call 'em OG's
Know that they cold, live by a code
I feel it different when, living a different way
That's how it goes, that's how it goes
But I know my shit is gold, yeah
I know my shit is gold

I was locked up, ate all my feelings like cheese
I was blocked up, had to start opening things
I would not touch, had to acknowledge some dreams
I could not sleep, had to be seen on [?], I could not creep
Had to be Aries, Elise, I am not sheep
Shit that I carried for years finally got me
Shit that I carried for years finally got me

That's why I'm moving with emotion, no force
Wavy like the ocean, of course
Who gave you the notion, I couldn't roll on my own
Had to hop off the wave, learning to float on my own
Copped the boat on my own, verse that I wrote on my own

// No More Magical //

It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical

Ever gripped the chalice
Wasn't gifted balance
Held shit steady wit my hands you can see it in the callous
See em speaking fallacy
I seen em bury talents
Behind the curtains fatasty too
They call it magic I don't
A beauty pageant of sorts
I could imagine of course
I took the road less traveled
Won't even track it for sport
This Coaching jacket legit
Me and my niggas a force
Most couldn't match our flame
A matchbook to a torch
A flap jack ina pan
We backflipped off the porch
The backdrops is the same
But each pictures distorted
I paint them shits while they snoring
I'm tryna shake em awake
But it look like they enjoy it

It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical

Third eye closed
Birds eye view
Hear what he say
Watch what he do

Third eye closed
Birds eye view
Hear what he say
Watch what he do
Can't trust a soul what I'm posed to do
Threw his ass 11 catch 22
I just wanna know who I'm gone run into
Can't tell who been woke and who is just now coming too
Bank tell me I'm broke I know which one running through
We gone get that government funding too
What the summer do
Blacken us
Short and long list of how they tracking us
Flipping ips like a spatulas
Catchin me I'm cooked
We be all outta bounds you can color me shook
Still shoot my shot shout a young devin book

It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical

// Off The Drugs //

Caught me slipping, I was sipping bourbon
Unfamiliar feelings, it's that liquid courage
For every brave heart lies a coward lurking
Far from perfect, niggas wishy-washy
Death and taxes only things certain
Speaking of I paid mines through
What you doing for the night? She said, "You"
I said, "Quit playing games, slide through"

Hopeless romance, I throw my hands up
Been in my bag, three nights alone, she held me for ransom
We getting throwed like a tantrum
We both used to the fronting
Pump faking got us jumping to assumptions
Tonight I'ma live and maintain
I'm getting high just to see this whole thang, yeah
When off the drugs

Show me some love
On a good trip and I hope it never end
High as the ceiling fan and I got the spins
When off the drugs

The paper's rolled, the blunt's a non-no
No dibs no doobies 'bouta get lit by my dolo
White grape white owl was my first love, I can't go no more though
Moving through this water, let me show you how it's different
How I shout boat lifted reminiscing on them days when I would buy the pack to flip it
Couldn't tell me I wasn't gifted with the vegetation
Overdid it sometimes too, descriptive with my education
Edibles gon' hit in 'bout a hour, that's late registration, class has been in session
We ain't present my whole section has been classy
Run and tell it, you can feel it, you can smell it
Breaking chains now, these niggas want the link to my connection
Monster's Inc could make a link to my inception
Open your Mike Wazowski, start reflecting off these ounces, I got pounds of work
Pouncing at the chance to push it, patient with the curing process
Doubt it and my mans a pull it off the stem for good measure
Off the drugs like good weather, is may weather gon' take a hit like Mayweather
Won't say whether I'm high or I'm fly, I just play feather

Show me some love
On a good trip and I hope it never end
High as the ceiling fan and I got the spins
When off the drugs

Politicians got me moving cutthroat
Scapegoating migrants into sunk boats
While they spend our taxes on
Some top coke
Chopping down our forests till we cough smoke
Add it up
Add it up
Cose their sum gross
They say African nations got corrupt laws
While they giving contracts to their uncles
Do they think we're stupid, yea they must do?
They won't change their ways until we bust through
I'm with my people and the bus full
Calling climate justice it's about time
Cose our black people on the front line
Ain't you seeing what I'm seeing
Hurricanes and fires blazing, flooding in Savannah basins
We were all indigenous until they slaved us

Losing bees nigga

Losing trees we won't notice until there ain't no tissue
This shit can't continue
But it just keep right on rolling keep them lights on I can't find one moment
Know the darkness right up on us I'ma need Patronus

// Percy //

Yeah, I'm smoking by myself
Yeah, I'm smoking by myself
Yeah, I'm smoking by my fucking lonely

Percy Jackson got the light, these niggas don't want action
Whole new era, all I see is capping
Sporting waves, no stocking cap
May jock the fly but I got flows to kill a mockingbird
I drop some verbs and niggas asked what happened
They see the growth then ask me bout a shortcut
If you don't get the fuck
Go split a blunt and come with way more guts
They talk beef, we seek choice pork cuts
I'm screaming fuck 12, need white blood cells
I'm too sick with the pen like dumbell
I move heavyweight
Smoking out the P with my mans in his Chevy waiting on our cue to go
Weed residue all on my cuticles, I been grinding
Paper cuts all on my fingertips, been taking my time
Counting the digits, the relationship is strictly platonic though
Couldn't love the money if a young nigga wanted to
Gotta love the struggle, it's the hustle I'm drawn into
Flipped a old school and it didn't need no 22's
This a Percy, I ain't passing a blunt to who
All my niggas came with their own trees rolled
You must not be my nigga, nigga be gone

This one's a personal
I'm smoking by myself
Uh, I'm smoking by my fucking lonely
Yeah, I'm smoking by myself
Uh, I'm smoking by my fucking lonely

Yeah, yeah, ayy
Roll scavenger flows, it's gold lavender
Flower from the [?] so I smoke with no amateurs
Chief [?] green from Canada
Brodie still on paper so you waiting while we ran it up
Pass it to myself, I'm in the foreign in pajamas
[?] where gorillas keep bananas, keep the phantom tucked
See this got me paranoid as fuck, I don't know who to trust
Smoking by myself cause I don't give a fuck
These days I'm [?] reason with these heathens
You can tell I'm from the fire breathing breed
Light speed, Godspeed
[?] tree
I be smoking by myself
I be feeling like a G
I be feeling like I'm God
I be wondering if he feeling like me
Percy Jackson never had no trouble with the sea
With the wave, with the deep
Niggas slaves, niggas sheep
Ain't pass it to these niggas so pass the shit to me
Pass it I don't need it keep it moving I'm with free

This one's a personal
This it for me, this it for me, this it for me
I'm smoking by myself

We could take our time, or, you can take your time
I mean, I know what I want

Hella respect your disposition, you open my mind
It really makes me no difference if you don't open your legs
More interested in introspective conversation instead
Been ahead, of most niggas my age for quite some time now
Don't let me find out, that you crushin' on a nigga at all
I'm steppin' to you muthafucka, catcall
If ever in distress I'll peep yo' S.O.S like batcalls

You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, at all, at all
Lady I ain't pressed for time

Cause I don't ever wanna be the one that rush you into something
Girl I got your back and I ain't into fronting so I'm pennin' something so you know that I ain't thinkin' with assumptions at all
Ain't known you long enough to go through withdrawals, but often I have to pause, I'm recollectin' your smile
I must confess I'm beguiled, enthralled, entranced
You fragrance is enchanting, I swoon and I dance
Such a sophisticate, damn
Yeah, you articulate style and we gon' be so meticulous, this shit might take a while
I mean this might take some time, I mean you might need some time
I mean- I mean I know what I want

Remember when we were younger, we were so drunk in love
Still chasin' better bitches, and then I ain't get no fuck
But now dance with me naked, I make you feel less inferior
I'm just tryna rearrange and change your interior
So baby you know, you know that daddy he be feelin' ya
Your ribs in your heart, that's a good place to start and you know that I harness
Now take off your garments and don't be shy, I'll fuck you regardless
See all my partners know you got me buggin'
Fuck it, exalting me, you my shining star while singing Manhattan
Let's make it happen, you be the co, I'm the captain

Can't bring you to the parties 'cause they all start bussin' in my ends
Mmm, I love 'em, but you just something different
Meet my mama and my cousins
Got me outta character too soon
'Cause I know you look good in a black suit
And I know you think about these things too, don't lie
I don't wanna rush it 'cause we got time, mmm uh

Let's call a spade a spade
I think I got the hands for the games you play
Flop the nuts, now it's training day
You want the turn for a change of pace
I know the river be my saving grace
I sipped your water but I can't shake the taste
I'm on tilt, it's no paper chase
I'm more built, drop the ankle weights
I'm on stilts, fuck the low-key shit
Had high hopes when I came your way
A royal flush and we exchange and face, like

// Shade 45 Freestyle //

If you knew better you niggas would do better
They want it less complicated, I'm never gon' lose letters
Not even for new cheddar
Don't feel the need to beef it up when I abuse lettuce
Thrifty, dub print shorts, shooting the breeze
Like a drive-by, young fly guy that's never gon' lose feathers
Cop the purple or the green when the BB King blues get us
Couple that with my height and the paces at which I write
And it's safe to say that I make enough music for two niggas
Make it for you niggas, hope that you catch the message
Hope that between the flash and the flare you pause and reflect it
I'm hoping checks get collected like a Nike shoe fetish
I'm shooting for New York Times, right now we newsletters
Not enough paper, way too many issues
Sweat from the grind require way too many tissues
Get a towel in here, F-R, can a nigga get a vowel in here?
Matter fact two E's, matter fact that's FREE
Bumping facts through these tracks
And these tracks get assembled like a factory
Ain't no stopping or attacking me, it's Mick Jenk-word

// Sleep //

I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep

I like my coffee black as all her favorite movies
Never going back to jail, I say that loosely
Before the handcuffs, they'll probably shoot me
I'm taking it back to '67 sped off in a two door
My notebook got me extra loose leaf
I'm in a function, fifteen minutes, then I chuck the deuces
Keep it raw, I'm on a roll, no sushi
Had to wrap my green and black, that avocado maki
The Parmesan will have you thinking that it's time to Bruce Lee
But I am no Goofy, hell my horses niggas love to jockey
Flows too cold, needs no Zamboni, we already polished
We know the phonies using makeup and they switching stylists
Held up attacking, these niggas childish
We need them truly, call the academy, he acting all of that emotion
I call my shorty, she the only one who knew me

I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep
I was sleeping

Deep in REM, I swear this shit the matrix
Like he fresh up outta coma, or relearning basics
I used to think my shit didn't stink because it smelled so different
I guess it's kinda like when racists swear that they're not racist
I'm owning up, I'm doing work, I'm not gon' play it down
These days can't knock me off my square, I'm not gon' play around
Felon locked two damn niggas hate the sound
Grinding up the jack hammer, niggas breaking ground
When I see flows, heard a joint from muscle memory, need a icy hot
6 a.m., I'm on Twitter with a spicy taste
This shit take time, you couldn't change that with an icy watch
For a fashionable nigga, I was high key late
Ricki Lake, I had to lose some fucking weight, I did
Once I woke up, all my dreams became some great ideas
Then ideas just as quickly became some shit I did
You talking jokes, you think I did this shit to say I did
Say I did, never see 'em walking what they talk
Thousand words later, no Gordon Parks
In the deeper parts of water where it's more dark

I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep
I was sleeping
I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes
I was...

// Snakes //

Pulled up in the vintage thang
Checked the rearview through the vintage frames
That's just gang behind me
Dirty niggas no stains behind me
Freenation no ball and chain
A few niggas that came with slime are what niggas might call insane
They like callin bluffs
I won't call it game if a nigga can't play when we call the refs
Can't state the stats debating facts without the effort
Blatant act like Golden State without the Steph
The glue ain't right the ankle shake the shoe ain't right
I do it well I manifest the blue and white
I'm too legit I'm doing it right
Still they hate so
That don't mean I make it through the night

We been building Isosceles
Conduct like apostrophes
And you know we need the acknowledgement
You can't talk shit with apologies at the end of your sentences
Concentrate, the truth can't kinda be
I'm looking for kindred folk
I'm finding my folk all like anaconda be

Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master
Just one in the same
Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master

Snakes only wanna tip the scales when your pockets heavy
I remember days piece of mind coming secondary to this peace of mine
Gotta hold it steady gotta concentrate
I been planting seeds water working 'til the levee break
I know seasons change and the tall grass make the serpents deadly til they penetrarte
If I tell it I can pen a book
You can come to London baby take a look
I know real drillers I know real niggas
We don't feel niggas know we got em shook
Same bruddas that will smile with you
Quick to put the pistol to your pearly whites
Keep my circle tight like numb pussy
Just a couple brothers ain't none pussy

Maybe it's sorcery
Conduct like apostrophe
I need me some accolades
If I'm speaking honestly
I need me a couple plugs
Just check my discography
They don't want no parts of me
I'm shedding my skin just like anacondas be

Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master
Just one in the same
Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master

// Somebody Dies //

There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies

Aye
Aye, she gon' ride
Gon' have to catch us if you can
Gon' have to match me if you smoke
Gon' step out like I'm Dapper Dan
I mean, thousand thread count shawty
Prolly why these niggas sleeping on the floor
I mean, I don't need to sneak about it
I don't even think about it, I just go
I mean, fuck I need to call the bros for?
Need to call to get a pedicure the way a nigga stand ten toes though
I could make it all ever clear
I ain't got to bring a hundred proofs to you
I just try to bring the truth to you
Real ones ain't no use to you
Y'all ain't ever got to news for me
Fuck
Ugh

Trippin' bout how you gripping Smith &'s and this and that, that's a lie
Kickin' back eating chicken backs with some fries
I deny any claims that my city bangs
But if I had to claim in these sides,
I'd make my name the gang so when you say my name you'd bang mine
Infrared on your head I aim wise
When my lead it spread I take lives
All because you tried to take mine
Fuck with mine and then somebody dies
Flatline

There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies

I want to fix all the things that I've broken
I want the merciful touch of the omen
Sick of the mundane flow of the motions
I don't cover no more bitches in lotions
Nah
Keep one of them chicks and I love her to death
With every new day, death creeps in my breath
I'm running my clock and there ain't much left
High stress my heart might beat out my chest
Done with the poison I weed out the rest
Love was appointed it beat out the sex
Trust is avoided I prenup the rest
Man, fuck with the opiates, flush out my flesh
I'ma breath in slow then I feel that I'm blessed
I'ma bleed out more in the dead of the den
Thrown to the wolves and I'm back with a vengeance

There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies

// Steam //

Since oakwood I been moving this dope
Tryna give you this truth, so potent, every line is
Quote, 'overhit', I'm a fiend
Niggas scratchin' like I been in the DJ booth
I know that we ain't heard it like this since the
South Side expected to be so uncouth, or allude
Assassins made you believe that it's easier to coat with in the coupe
You don't want this small water words that I wrote
Puff puff to the joint, go pull
They shootin' ova there where the youngins playn games
Dubbed up, betta run no goose
I know that you don't want no noose
A lil' too loose with chores, betta choose yo sword, much wiser
I'm tired to see this drink, more water
Be the only time when I ever beat it down
When I tell these niggas stink more harder
A SPS scholar, pardon, I think more chader
Momma had to think more further
Pops never even thought about it
Cops only seen one side, they can solve profiles
Niggas don't doubt it, niggas already know mine
Showtime, spit a couple clothes line
While yo beat is superfluous, coat signed?
Seven high King's drive picture me rollin'
South Side, where they shoot magazines
I'm alive, never picture me posin'
I ain't neva did CQ
And I ain't eve claimed GD
I'm with my folks
Know I got a gingerale with my smoke
Know I got a pair of cuff with my loafs
Do it for the free even when I'm broke
College dropout, he drive slow
Man we like the A-team tracks, like an A-bomb, I've been spitting napalm
Tell me do you feel it, tell me is it burning?
Tell me if you learning, tell me can you tell that this nigga is the realest?
Nigga I'm a realist
So many layers and it's really 'bout how many you peelin' back
Give it to the people with appealing facts
Make it so loud that you can still smell it from like
Three blocks down when they seal the pack
Send it thru the mail, you don't get it till like three years later,
And it still a smack
Some like how they brew and seal the Jack
How can you hate on that? That's best
I told y'all, I don't even know one win no debate on that
I can bet on that
I'm a keep droppin' bombs, I don't really gotta flex with that
He don't stress fo' that, he don't even act stressed fo' that
So if you wonder where the check for a nigga on his shit

// Steps //

Ugh

I could give a fuck about a chain
Need a chance, need some change
Fuck a dance
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
Like to look at pictures out the frame
Got no chance in this game
Out your lane
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
With my

I think I could make her pussy backflip, aye
She could hold her water like a cactus, aye
I don't wanna take her 'round the atlas, aye
I just wanna fuck until my back ache
One step, step back bitch I'm a spectacle and I'm proud
This pedestal is where berettas blow but I'm not the man to take down
They finna milk the boy the minute that I come across as any type of cash cow
I got a pill addiction that I'm trying to kick, but when I kick the bitch kick me down
One step forward, two step back
Don't stress when they press the metal to my neck
I'm gold little boy the medal on my neck
Deflower women I got a meadow in my bed

Taking steps to do right by you
Taking steps to do right by you

I could give a fuck about a chain
Need a chance, need some change
Fuck a dance
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
Like to look at pictures out the frame

I think I could make her pussy backflip, aye
She could hold her water like a cactus, aye
I don't wanna take her 'round the atlas, aye
I just wanna fuck until my back ache (I-I)
I gotta switch up my mind set
I don't got nothing but time, bet
Taking a step at a time, yes
Better myself, feel it in my chest
Now let me digress
I been away from the topic
I'm overwhelmed and I'm godless
My fear of god is ironic
It's pulling teeth in my conscious
And I don't know an orthodontist
Young hemophiliac
Blood over water but I downed in Cognac
Never get a rubber when I get to rub the cat
Irresponsible, but fuck I'll place my bets

Taking steps to do right by you

I could give a fuck about a chain
Need a chance, need some change
Fuck a dance
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
Like to look at pictures out the frame

Fuck boy called thinking that he real cunning
Told me "can you check if your refrigerator running?"
Don't waste my time, I'ma see you when I see you
Then I made him run the freezer, bitch it ain't that funny
But I been writing my wrongs now
And I been trying to calm down
He put the gat to my face and I'm facing the fact that he won't put the gun down
Blow
That's crazy
Now my momma got one less baby
In the name of the "fuck you, pay me"
Thought you said that you would not betray me
Gave my spot away to get a bit of cash
I would died for you, man that shit fugazy

Taking steps to do
Taking steps to do right by you

I could give a fuck about a chain
Need a chance, need some change
Fuck a dance
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
Like to look at pictures out the frame

Good smoke, lungs stronger
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near feeling just like Peter
Damn near walking on this shit until I falter
Joint rolling need a filter
But I don't spit it with a filter
Brita filtered or the truth is off kilter
I mean whose history's author?
You was never right if you read it right
Am I throwing shade, am I shedding light?
I've been catching vibes
Young Jerry Rice going deep... with it
See it clear through Fetty Wap left eye, don't even gotta creep... with it
Monkey see, monkey do
Crabs in a barrel everybody sheep... with it
Thousand count sheet fitted everybody sleep with it
It's the system nigga we get it
They'll take the world
They'll break the world
Then look at us like (we... did it)

Ya'll just can't front on us niggas no mo'

It ain't never that sweet
As you niggas out here smoking reggie
You can never match me
At the forefront of culture
How you tyrna drive it from the backseat?
More and more vultures coming at we
Racists motherfuckers ain't happy
Me and all my niggas in here banded up
Don't get it twisted fam this ain't backstreet
Progressing everyday this ain't last week
You can't catch we
If we eliminated every black invention
Motherfuckers wouldn't last a week
Still move haphazardly
On behalf of we

Ya'll just can't front on us niggas no mo'
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
Good smoke, lungs stronger

Running to tomorrow like fuck my actions until I run into tomorrow

And off the record I said dude get it together
Almost launched ya
I sure hope my last night operation as my favourite xan effect
Like if I don't remember nothing then I got like no regrets
I been dodgingfamily madly play around with death
You want call four fouls, I'm still paying off the ref
I'm still sticking out my chest, poppa said I'll get respect
That ain't work, million dollar smirk when charm take their work
Now respect don't mean shit, ain't worth my spit mixed in the dirt
That ain't work, million dollar smirk when charm take their work
Now respect don't mean shit, ain't worth my spit mixed in the dirt

I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace, yeah

You one hunnid in my space or you slow my pace, two face
I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace

When I fuck her got her singing up to heaven's gates
North Face bitch, I'm ready for an expedition
Wrist all stupid in the winter and the boot missing
Used to have to re-up, now I got my bag
Fuck what any haters say bitch I'm in my bag
Knock him stone cold then I take his bitch for takeout
Rocking stone, looking gorgeous everyday now
Never taking L's cash rules everything around me, yeah
I don't need a pill to fit in my surroundings, yeah
Mick brought the water, sip that in the club yeah
Money trees, bad bitches, more love yeah
Throwing bands like a quarterback
Switch hoes like clothes, leave 'em in the past

Hit this waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Drippin never dry (never, yeah yeah)
If you wanna ride (wanna ride yeah yeah)
Then you gotta climb (know you gotta climb)
Gotta put the work in (work)
Fuck the bullshit, all I hear is chirpin (chirp)
Better if you...
Hit this waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Bitch you know I'm right

I just try to stay authentic
Know a lot of niggas say they own it when they rentin'
Lemon when I bought it had to get the windows tinted
Lookin out them bitches all I ever see is gimmicks that niggas mimic
What's the intrinsic value when the lights around you just keep dimmin'
See niggas jumpin' ship, that just isn't how we swimmin', crushed linen
Fam is always gon' be wrinkles this shit ain't much different
Selfish denim know I'm cut different
Just know that I don't got no "I don't give a fuck" missin'
The thruth missin'
I spit it like a tooth missin'
Uncouth got the roof missin'
I just burst through the ceiling how did you get in?
Proof of purchase now whole crew got spent

Check me hula hoop with the shoebox blend
Low key hope you clocked in

// What Am I To Do //

Well I bet ya
Well I bet ya
Well I bet ya
Well I bet—

Ali's jabbin' them shit feel like hooks
The less you got stuffed in your pocket books
The more these politicians just sound like crooks
They give me sloppy looks
They gave us nothing, had to hustle same way coffee cook
Early morning grind trying to help these niggas wake up
Etch A Sketch flows, I got the shit to shake up
Niggas switching clothes
Niggas even switch their face up
But these clowns could never really switch their make up
Family's in your genes
Fuck is that, Mesquite?
My triple beam onto bigger schemes
I'm on these waves
Don't expect a hand-clap 'cause you swim upstream
I'm expecting sand traps, I be in the green
If we talking green backs I'm back in the black
Been having the formula since Similac
Delicate flows under heavy metal bars but they're still intact
What's a nigga to do?
When you call the police but the trigger's on you
Shit crazy, man

What's a nigga to do?
'Cause I be streaming black they'll beat me to blue
Put it on TV then tell you what's true
What's a nigga to do?
What's a nigga to do?
When you call the police but the trigger's on you

Pull up on 'em shining CeCe Winans with the C notes
Redefining everything the black man denotes
I could devote time
How many times have we rewrote lines to get it perfect
Miss me with inertia I'm on dirt
You gon' need assumptions, almost certain
My assertion we gon' see if you got gumption
We gon' see if you gon' play it smart or you gon' be on dumb shit
Wrong answer, we-go-dumb shit
Slow you up on some speed-bump shit
On some ski-jump shit
I'm taking flight 'cause all my flows cold
Setting bars, no pole vault
I never blow smoke unless it's unleaded
I guess you won't know my worst
No unedited stress
Go on wax, I mean

What's a nigga to do?
When you tell 'em who you is and they be like "Who?"
What's a nigga to do?
Yeah, what's a nigga to do?
'Cause I be streaming black they'll beat me to blue
Put it on TV then tell you what's true
What's a nigga to do?
What's a nigga to do?

You only body build 'cause you afraid to feel cardio
Thru my appeal she feel that it was sacred
Wait lets take it slow before I blow
Then adios
At least I kept it real
Ten toes concealed
Audio Repeat

You only bodybuild instead of healing other sections underneath
I put a fill inside perfection
And that's when rejection speak
Note it brief, keep peace
And light order if not with me
I'm borderline of the peak of your favorite nine rappers least,
Put the coordinate, order this mic,
In spite laughter of the audience
They kept lacking so I combo'ed em quicker than CNN
Can't never know to make amends
Or blow em out the park so out of wind
And struggle oxygen far long my forgotten friend

Okay I speed off then I'm done
I will not turn behind my sons

When there was no sun

Soon as we link it's time to smoke up
You best be vocal, this ain't no shelter pot don't choke up
You cannot hold us, the gas the only think we cough up
The A1 octive, you know we low key had to boss up
A spades a spade we ran to Boston blew the block up,
My nigga back up, best know the flavor tryna clock us
Sit back and watch us, we moving this shit like it's rocked up
Shoot like Rocky, when he was Rambo got the pocky
A box of sticks, we at the Ritz Waltz through the lobby

I know you see me can't even copy nigga
Okay I speed off
Then I'm done
I will not
Turn behind my sons

// Young King //

I was lost, but now I'm found
Young king without a crown
Catch you when I come back 'round
These niggas too close (Too close)

What is life if you livin' without a purpose
The thought alone of me failing, it makes me nervous
Tryna dodge the distractions, I'm tryna keep it determined
So I been in the booth like a preacher be in sermon
It's church nigga
I feel like destiny been flirtin'
You get in my way imma wash 'em, get the detergent
You witnessing a legend emergin', tell 'em it's urgent
I see they tryna set me up, certainly that ain't workin', uhh
You mess with me, you rest in peace, respectfully
If it ain't 'bout no money or the family then just let it be
I hop on the beat, it's a connection, we got chemistry
This is like Walter White cookin' methamphetamine
I been makin' progress but it ain't all great
I been tryna keep the peace and keep my head on straight
I been cuttin' people off 'cause it been dead on weight
I keep my space 'cause 99% of these niggas fake

I was lost, but now I'm found
Young king without a crown
Catch you when I come back 'round
These niggas too close
They tried to kick me while I'm down
But I got up off the ground
And made it out
Now they clappin' like "Kudos"
I was lost, but now I'm found
Young king without a crown
Catch you when I come back 'round
These niggas too close
They tried to kick me while I'm down
But I got up off the ground
And made it out (Made it out)

Coldest nigga under heaven, oh
People always talk about the bread I-
Tend to find they bread is unleavened though
Yeast?
Who brought tortilla chips to the feast?
We may never know
In this [?] at the Steppenwolf
Seen all the roles niggas played before
Seen Poitiers before
Seen vanish points that they pay to know
We got the advantage, Imma play to grow
Ohh, I'm at Trader Joe's
In her purse lookin' through my spinach
Really floss, I could use a dentist pronto
Quit the front-o, niggas didn't really want smoke
I'll black 'em out, see niggas smile at the gun smoke
Pull back around, they sent him down state with one stroke
The pen is cut-throat
These niggas sucrose
I swear that shit is back in style
I'm like old braids full of new growth
To drink this water you goin' have to drown

I was lost, but now I'm found
Young king without a crown
Catch you when I come back 'round
These niggas too close
They tried to kick me while I'm down
But I got up off the ground
And made it out
Now they clappin' like "Kudos"
I was lost, but now I'm found
Young king without a crown
Catch you when I come back 'round
These niggas too close
They tried to kick me while I'm down
But I got up off the ground
And made it out (Made it out)

// Zodiac //

[Sadistik:]
Pretty little zodiac
Tell me are you listening?
Why don't you say hello back
When the ghosts are visiting?
Living in the sediment
Scribbling my sentimental
Mental into wet cement
Everything I said I meant
Not living in the present
Skies become so heavy
I feel like a piñata when it's empty
I'll fill another bottle I'm a MD
20/20 hindsight
In a place that's full of people I don't quite like, aye
Looking out the glass again
Aspirations aspirate
Compliments are aspartame
Tears feel like they're acid rain
Always been a castaway
Don't save me I'm just trash today
I'm refuse
Usually you're bruised when you get used to feeling used
All these ups and downs I learned to ride the waves
Most the nightmares are when I'm wide awake
I don't wanna go don't let me die today
If it makes me numb I'll take the side effects

[Mick Jenkins:]
If it makes me numb I'll take the side effects
If it makes me…
If it gets me pissed off puff smoke
So much talking out the neck nigga we cut-throat now
Not what you would expect
Fuck your assuming we just added the seasonings
Told 'em hoe don't be cumin when the thyme right
Lime-light in my eye I don't need that
Cash when I require best believe that
In hindsight was just getting by
'Til I was 25 I'm coming live
Oh did I mention I beat statistics?
Made the fire with the friction
My diction sophisticated no fiction has been recited
The credit for a belated, shit is Kriss Kriss
No jokes the politicking make my dick soft put it in quotes now
Fuck up out your respect
See how I'm moving niggas low-key
It's hard to stay quiet with the OG on me
Only a couple niggas I call homies these days
Said some prayers that got the phonies erased
If we ain't FaceTiming then you ain't really know me these days
Not too much talking do my growing silent
