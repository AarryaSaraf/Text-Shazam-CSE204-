Album: SlaughtersBigRipOff

// Slaughter's Theme //

You better know it
You better know it
You better know it
Huh

If a hitman don't get you then Slaughter will
Streets don't deal with the funky mind, soon be killed
You better know it, you better know it
Fight for what you think is right, don't give up
Fight it when you know you're right
You sure enough got to pick on him
Either a man with an organization or kind loving slim
You better know it, you better know it, hey
Wait, time for the turnaround, that means change from front to back

Hey hey, it's time for the turnaround, that's change from front to back
Got to do it the new way, keep the people off your back
But when it's time to kill
If the hitman don't get you then Slaughter will
You better know it, wait, let me tell you who Slaughter is
He's a brother who won't answer to Spider, Snake or Sam
Dealin' with his mind...
Deal you can't refuse

Wait! Let me tell you who Slaughter is
Slaughter, ha, he's a brother who won't answer to Spider, Snake or Sam
Dealin' with his mind, brother, don't give a damn
He does what he has to do 'til every man has gone
And nothin', and nothin' left
He fights like hell, keep on livin' and die when he just can't help himself
That's Slaughter
Put that in your pipe and smoke it
Lay it on your funky note then soak it

// Big Strong //

They say love ain't nothin' but the blues
Everybody got the blues sometimes
They say that love ain't nothin' but the blues
And everybody got the blues sometimes
Come on over here, try me, baby
Get a taste of this blues of mine

I wanna know do you know what it means to be in love?
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night?
Do you, do you, do you know what it means to be in love?
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night?
Most of all, when you love someone
You always take the wrong instead of the right
And all I wanna ask ya, plenty blues

// Sexy, Sexy, Sexy //

Hey, yeah
She's sexy sexy sexy
She's sexy sexy sexy
I love the few pals
But the fellas whistle at my baby too loud
Because she's just, she's just sexy sexy sexy, ha
That's what she is now, uh, ooh-wee
Sexy sexy sexy
Hey

Can't let her name ring
Because I know I got a thing
Don't watch her legs, can't watch her dress
You'll appreciate a sister than dig that mess
She's just sexy sexy, ha, that's what she is now
Sexy, hit me, hey, uh

Can't get enough
That makes me rough
Love me tender, good God
I know I'm tough

She got stallion hips
Got cheeks and lips
You see, a dog don't want a bone, ha
That's why he buries it
Don't talk about a thing I don't know about
But a right on stallion, that's what I got
'Cause she's just sexy, sexy
She's sexy sexy sexy, all right
Now baby, bring your good thing home
Now baby, bring your good thing home, all right

Soul sister, if you got a man, that need his job to be billed
Don't waste your time, ha, bring it to a man that will
If you a, sexy, sexy sexy sexy
Only, only, only if you're sexy, sexy, sexy sexy sexy, all right
Walk on with that soul power thigh
With that shape that keep me sanctified
Make me wanna spank, ha, oh Lord
Make me wanna spank
Be mellow and be sweet
Forget about the dice, sit down and cheat
Move the dead weight, you don't
'Cause the more I get, the more I want
Because she's, sexy, sexy sexy
Sexy, sexy sexy
Listen sister, if you got something to show let it show
If you got something to move, let it move

// How Long Can I Keep It Up //

Sitting here, it's a drag
But you know, I'm gonna sit right here until my man comes home
Because I believe in him, and I believe in what he's trying to do
And I know that sooner or later, he'll come walking in that door
And I'm gonna be right here to greet him
With a cup of coffee, and maybe a sandwich
But I have faith in him
And I know that he's doing what he feels is right
But you know, sometime I ask myself: Is this all in vain?
My friends are walking around, they're talking about me and saying I'm a fool
And I ask myself: How long can I keep it up?

It's been days and nights since you were here to hold me
I even miss the screamin', and all of those bad temper fights
I'm determined to see you, just as soon as I can
And even though you make me wait, you're still my only man

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

I'll always wait for you
It's really not that hard to do
But it's truly a fact, and I can't actually relax
I wake up late at night, so scared I could hardly speak
But I'll always come through
Because I know someday soon, I'll see you

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

I know a man does what he feels is right
And it really means the world to me
Know there's always you
To think about, to care about, and always count on, too
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

You know I'd lie for you, stand up to any test
And if I have to kill, I would
I wouldn't kill you, but for you
And if I have to die, I'll die
As long as I die with you
But I'm Mama Feelgood, and I'm gonna have some fun
Even if it's at the point of a gun

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

It's the end, but I can go happy
Because I, I, I, I have one friend
A friend 'til the end, a friend 'til the end
You're the love friend
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?
How long, how long can I keep it up?
Can you tell me, how long can I keep it up?
I know I'll be there as long as you need me
But I wonder how long can it last
Even if it's at the point of a gun
I'm Mama Feelgood, and I'm gonna have some fun
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?
