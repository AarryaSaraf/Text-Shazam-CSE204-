Album: ThePayback

// The Payback //

Hey!
Got to, got to payback
(The big payback)
Revenge, I'm mad
(The big payback)
Got to get back, I need some get-back
Payback, payback
(The big payback)
That's it, payback, revenge
I'm mad!

You get down with my girlfriend, that ain't right
You hollering and cussing, you want to fight
Payback is a thing you gotta see
Hell, brother, do any damn thing to me
You sold me out for chicken change
(Yes you did)
You told me that they, they had it all arranged
You had me down, and that's a fact
And now you punk, you gotta get ready
For the big payback
(The big payback)
That's where I land, on the big payback
(The big payback)

I can do wheeling, I can do dealing
(Yes we can)
But I don't do no damn squealing
I can dig rapping
I'm ready, I can dig scrapping
But I can't dig that backstabbing
(Oh no)
Now brother get ready, that's a fact
Get ready you mother for the big payback
(The big payback)
Let me hit them, hit them, Fred hit them

You took my money, you got my honey
Don't want me to see what you doing to me
I can get back, I got to deal with you
Got to deal with you
Got to deal with you
I got to deal with you
Hey, let me tell you!
Get down with my woman, that ain't right
You holler and cuss, you wanna fight
Look here
Don't do me no done favor
I don't know karate, but I know ka-razor
(Yes we do)
Hey get ready, that's a fact, girl
Get ready you mother for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hey, I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a son of a man, but don't they tell you that pappa can
Get ready for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hit me again
Lord, lord, hey
Get ready
I need it, I need a hit again
The same one, the same one, same one
Hit me back, lord
(The big payback)

Sold me out for chicken change
Said my woman had it all arranged
Tried to make a deal, but she wanted to squeal
But I had my boys on her heels
Saw me coming, told a lie
She broke down and she wanted to cry
I don't care what she does
Won't be doing just like she was
Take those kids and raise them up
Show 'em how to drink out the righteous cup
Take her, take that woman, it's one place she found
Just run that mother out of town
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
Make her get up, make her get up, get out
I'm mad, I want revenge, I want revenge, my
(The big payback)
My patience ends, I want revenge
My patience ends, I want revenge
I want revenge, I want revenge
(The big payback)
Gonna get some hits, I need those hits
I need those hits, hit me!

Lord, I need those hits
Carry on, carry on, payback melody
Alright
(The big payback)

// Doing The Best I Can //

I'm doing the best I can
Doing the best I can

I'm only a man, darling
My life has been empty
Since you went away
I feel so very, very lonely
I just drift from day to day

I'm doing the best I can
Trying to get over
Doing the best I can

I'm brokenhearted
It's my fault
Treated you wrong so many times
I just wanna talk
I'm just a man
Doing the best I can

Now darling
I'm doing the best I can
Each and every day
So many times
I know you gone away
Said I know you gone away
I miss you each and every day
Every, every, every, every day I just...

I get lonely, night after night
Wonder if I'm doing what's wrong or if I'm doing what's right
But I'm only a man, baby
Babe I'm only a man
I'm for real
I'm for real and I'm doing the best that I can
I'm for real
Now baby
I'm for real
Now baby
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I sit down and I wonder
I'm for real
What and who and where
I'm for real
What have I been wrong, I wonder who cares
I'm for real
Tell me now
I'm for real
Is it right for me to suffer?
I'm for real
Yeah I stand with my head hangin' low
I'm for real
Wondering which way to turn
I'm for real
I don't know just where to go
I'm for real
How long can I keep it up?
I'm for real
Tell me, tell me
I'm for real
How long, how long?
I'm for real
I need it
I'm for real
My darling, I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real, baby, but I want you to know
I'm for real
I miss you baby, darling I miss you so
I'm for real
I miss you, darling
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I miss you, darling
I'm for real
How long can I keep it up?
I'm for real
Night after night
I'm for real
Don't know whether it's wrong or right
I'm for real
But here I stand baby
I'm for real
With my head hangin' so low
I'm for real
Here I stand, baby
Baby do you know?
Do you know?
I remember when you were here with me
I remember when you were here
I remember when you were here with me
I remember me and Mrs. Jones
I remember me and Mrs. Jones
How we had a thing goin' on
Oh we were carryin' on
We were carryin' on
I know deep down inside I was wrong
I want you to help me
Help me, help me
Help me darling, show me the way
Come to you one more time
Show me the way
I wanna know a way
I'm standing here with my head hanging low
I'm standing here
I said I'm, I'm standing here
I'm standing here, me and Mrs. Jones
I'm standing here
I know we were wrong, I just want some help

Oh, baby
Now can you make another friend
Can you, can you make another
Can you make another
Oh, darling
Do you know what it means to have someone need you?
Want you?
Oh you cheated on me, you should not have left me here
Should not have left me here

Makes me wanna cry
I'm so lonely, but baby I'm just a man
Doing the best I can
I, I, I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man

// Mind Power //

You know
We're dealing with
A very critical and crucial time
The most
Crucial and critical time that I've ever witnessed
Being as young as I am
You know
We all don't want to say nothing else, so we say "as young as we are."
Now I want to talk about
The pronunciation
And the realization
Now the educators
They call it
E.S.P.,
Positive thinking, right?
Some of the people across the other side of the pond call it
Vibe
Vibrations
Astrology and all those different things you understand

But I call it "what it is, is what it is"
What it is, is what it is

Look here
Now you see
A brother
You see, in the ghetto you find a whole lot of crime
I can understand
Hey
I know what it means
Being nine years old before I got my first pair of underwear out of a store
You know
Putting on a half
A half pressed suit
From the pawn shop
With tennis shoes
Trying to be hip
See I know where its coming from
Like the fellow sang, "having catfish head stew"
Its just like the catfish went in there with his head and came out very quick and didn't leave nothing else!
Now, there's one thing that the educators and the politicians and the establishment
Got to remember
Now, brothers need jobs

If you don't work
You can't eat
If you don't work
You can't eat
Get hip to yourself, good god, my brother, and get it from the street
If you don't work
You can't eat
Sis
If you don't work, lord
You can't eat

So you've got to have Mind Power to deal with starvation
And that's what we're dealing with
You see we can't
Go back to the biblical stories
"2 loaves of bread"
Er, "2 little fishes, 5 loaves of bread."
"2 little fishes", yeah
"5 loaves of bread."
Now look here
There's too many brothers going by that
Now I want you brothers to dig where we coming from
Set your mind
Right here
Dig the JBE experience
I dug this from a young man out of New York
He said the GBE
The GBE
Now we want to take it to the JBE
The JB Experience

Mind Power

Mind Power
Mind
Mind Power
What it is, is what it is
What it is, is what it is
It is
What it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
That's what it is
It is
What it is
That's what it is

You know
Dealing with Harlem
South Side of Chicago
The Bay area
Watts
Five Points, Buttermilk Bottom in Atlanta
Ninth Street in Augusta
West Broad in Savannah
U Street in Washington
Going on over to Baltimore
South Street in Philly
Boston
I know

Somebody needs to help us
Give us
Just give us a chance
Somebody
Brothers across the nation
You got to get yourself together
Unified
We need information
Brothers across the nation
Pass on that right-on
Information
Brothers across the nation
