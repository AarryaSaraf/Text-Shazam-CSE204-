Album: GettinDownToIt

// There Was A Time //

There was a day, there was a time
When I used to play
There was a time when I used to play
But take me now, baby, don't worry about later
Teach the dance I used to do
They call it the Mashed Potato

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk
Everybody relax and watch me work

In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

There was a time, sometimes I dance
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown

// Sunny //

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you

// That's Life //

Hey, uh, one more for the road, uh
Give me the groove

That's life, that's what the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top in June

Said that's life, uh, funny as it may seem
Funky as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
From steppin' on a dream
But I don't let it get me down
'Cause this ol' world keeps spinning around, uh

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, uh
A poet, a pawn and a king
Been up, down and over and out
But I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get right back in the race

That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting one time
The rent man wouldn't buy it, huh
And if I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die, hey

I've been a puppet, a pauper, pirate
A pawn and a king
Up and down, over and out
But I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

Said that's life, I can't deny it
Thought of running out
But my bills just wouldn't let me buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball
Said I'd roll up, huh, roll right up
I'd get my razor, go down to the neighborhood bar
Can you think, I'd walk up to the bartender
And I ask for a little drink
Go over in the corner, I'd feel so bad
I'd wanna be a loner
Try, try to hide
Turn my back, reach and get my slide
Then I'd, then I'd cut somebody else, hahaha

// Strangers In The Night //

Strangers in the night, exchanging glances
Wondering in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night to a lonely people world
Strangers in the night up to the moment
When we said our first hello, how little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embrace's a dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight in love forever
It turned out so right for we were strangers in the night

Strangers in the night to lonely people world
Strangers in the night up to the moment
When we said our first hello, how little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embrace's a dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight in love forever
It turned out so right for we were strangers in the night
We were strangers in the night

Didn't even know my name
Don't even, don't even know my name
I gotta have you just the same
I gotta have you, I gotta have you just the same

// Willow Weep For Me //

Baby, hey hey hey hey hey, baby
Baby

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me, alright

Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide a starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone, oh

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me, oh
When the shadows fall, bend little willow and weep for me
Weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Leave my heart breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide a starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone, oh no

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When your shadows fall, bend little willow and weep for me
Weep for me

When I'm sick, can't do no better
All I need is one little letter
Weeping, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm weeping
I'm weeping, I'm weeping willow tree
You got to weep in sympathy
You got to weep in sympathy
Willow, oh willow, oh willow weep for me
Weep on, willow weep for me
Weep on, oh now, oh now

// Chicago //

Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar, you'll lose the blues in Chicago
Chicago, the town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things that they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man, he danced with his wife in Chicago
Chicago, my home town

Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar, you'll lose the blues in Chicago
Chicago, the town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things that they never do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man and he danced with his wife in Chicago

Chicago, Chicago that's my home town

// All The Way //

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless they love you all the way
Happy to be near you
Oh, when someone cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless they need you all the way
Through the good years or the lean years
Or all the in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us, baby
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way
All, all the way

Deeper than the deep blue sea
That's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless they need you all the way
All, all, all the way, all the way, all the way

// It Had To Be You //

Four corners
Funky, funky, funky four corners

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
Somebody who could make me feel blue, could make me be true
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never, ever be cross or try to be boss
But they, they wouldn't do for nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, baby, I love you still

It had to be you, it had to be you, it had to be you
Shoo-ba-doo-ba-doo, it had to be you, it had to be you
Wandered around and finally found
Somebody who could make me feel blue, hey, could make me be true
Even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you
Shoo-ba-doo-ba

Some others I've seen, might never be mean, don't be so mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they, they wouldn't do
But nobody else gave me that look or thrill, ow
With all your faults, woman, I love you still

It had to be, it had to be, it had to be you, hey, hey
It had to be you, it had to be you, hey
I said, it had to be, had to be, it had to be you
You doggone, woman, you, heh heh heh, ow
