Album: OutOfSight

// Out Of Sight //

You got your high-heeled sneakers on
Slip-in mules
You got your high-heeled sneakers on
And your slip-in mules
You're more than all right
You know you're out of sight

You got a shapely figure, mama
That's keepin' me uptight
You got a shapely figure, mama
That keep me uptight
You're too much
You know you're out of sight

Hey, the way you do the thing you do
The way you kiss me too
The way you do the thing you do
The way you kiss me too
My heart delight, that's what you are
You know you're out of sight

Ho
Hey, hey

You got a sweet disposition
Ho, you're always right
You got a sweet disposition
You know you're always right
You know just what you're doing, baby
You know you're out of sight

Ow, you're too much
You're the end
You're so hip, baby
You know just where it's at
You're beautiful, mama
Most of all you're honest
There's no doubt you're out of sight
Out of sight, ooh, wee
Out of sight
You know that you're somethin' else

// I Wanna Be Around //

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company - wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine

// I Got You (I Feel Good) //

Wo! I feel good, I knew that I would, now
I feel good, I knew that I would, now
So good, so good, I got you

Wo! I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

[Sax, two licks to bridge]

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
and when I hold you in my arms
My love won't do you no harm

and I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, I got you

[Sax, two licks to bridge]

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can't do no wrong
and when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

and I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, well I got you

Wo! I feel good, I knew that I would, now
I feel good, I knew that I would
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you
So good, so good, 'cause I got you

[End lick]

[Short pause, drum cue]

Hey! Oh yeah-a...
