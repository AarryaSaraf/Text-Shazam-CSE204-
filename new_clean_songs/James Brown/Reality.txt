Album: Reality

// Reality //

Salvation, inflation
Depression and recession
Facing you whether it's in
Your home or on your corner

Don't let your separate beliefs
Let a lot of people starve
Orginization

Reality, Godfather
Sing it, James Brown

Reality is the thing for me
Reality is the thing for me
Yeah, yeah

Reality, reality
Reality, Godfather
Sing it, James Brown

I can't be myself
When I know I'm not
Doing no one else
Nobody

Everybody wanna go to Heaven
Nobody wants to die, yeah
Sing it, James Brown

Nobody wants to walk
Everybody wants to fly
Sing it, James Brown

Can't get no reservation
You've got starvation
Cause that's reality
Reality is the thing for me

Now let me read something to you
This is taken from the S&S
Use to be called Shakespeare
But we call it the
Streets of starvation

In the world of exactness
Half-stepping is totally out
You can jive, pride, and bull
Fool yourself but not the people

But if you wanna achieve a
Beautiful lifelong dream
You gotta set your head
In the right direction
You gotta deal with reality
Almighty reality

Reality is the thing for me, yeah
Reality, give me reality
Reality, I'll lie but you might
Not wanna hear what I tell you

Reality is the thing for me
Reality is the thing for me...

// Funky President (People It's Bad) //

Funky town, nasty

Get sexy, sexy, get funky and dance
Love me baby, love me nice
Don't make it once, but can you make it twice

People, people, we've got to get over
Before we go under
People, people, well well well

Turn on your funk motor until you get enough, yeah
Hey, give yourself a chance to come through
Wow, tell yourself, I can do what you can do

Hey, listen to the man, rap godfather
Pay back, cold blooded

People, people, we've got to get together
Oh, get on your good foot, huh, change it, yeah

Got to get together and get some land
Raise our food just like the man
Hey... I got to say it again
We got to get together and buy some land
Raise our food just like the man

Yes, I can see it too...

// Check Your Body //

(Body, check it out now... You got a body...
Funky, funky body, check it out...
Tell 'em mighty Godfather, go...)

You've got this on your mind, telling them we are through
You wanna fight the world by yourself, I know it's true
You really don't wanna stay, I know you've made up your mind
But before you go away, see what you left behind

Check your body (check your body)
Check it out (check it out)
Check out your (funky, funky) body
(Check your body) body
(Check your body) ooh, ooh, ooh
(Check it our now)

So we just can't get a loan, we just can't get a loan
It's always for others meant
If it's not, where have you been?
It's probably where your money's spent
I know you wanna go, but try on your mind
Your mind is already gone, but before you make a move...

Check it out! (check your body)
Check out your funky body (body!)
My man! (your body) I made it mine
Body! (body) yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Mm! Say brother... play me a new groove, if you don't mind

Mm! You wake up, baby
You make your own money, you drive your own car
You'll never be lonely, to your friends you are a star
You've won every man you need, ah, uh-huh
Ease your troubling mind, and see what you left behind!

So check your body (your body)
You better think about it!
And give yourself some time, and check your body
(Check your body) body (body)

Now Fred! (Yeah?)
Move air back there, and blow your horn, brother
I need a little reverb, 'cause I wanna sound deep and gritty
Pretty is on the corner, street lady! Woo!
Street lady, street lady, yeah yeah yeah yeah...
You star you, street lady, woo...!

Oh... I can see it now, yeah...
Yeah, I can see it too... this smile...
What from, moments... I can see it...
There are pink letters...
Very clear, right ahead of me... hey sister...
I can see it all night...!
Yes, I can see it too...

// Don't Fence Me In //

Yeah, when things get too thick
And they got to thin out
That's okay too, but deal with me, do me right

Give me land, lots of land under the troubled skies above
But don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me lie by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
But don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountain rise

I wanna ride where the West commences
And check out Sacramento and L.A
'Til I lose my senses
I don't play hobbles and I can't stand fences
But don't, don't fence me in

Come on, mmm
Don't, don't exile my thoughts
Turn me loose, yeah yeah yeah
Give me some room now
Getting hard out here

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountain high

I wanna ride where the West commences
And check out San Diego
'Til I lose my senses
Can't stand hobbles and I don't want no more fences
But don't, don't fence me in

Give the man a chance
Open up, open up the door
Don't fence me in
What about the kids?
Don't fence me in
Ay hey hey hey hey
What about the kids?
Don't fence me in
Give me some room

// All For One //

It's all for one, and one for all!
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!

From slave ships to the championships...
People! We've got to use the power of Soul
To drive us to our final goal
We've got to unify, and we must, we must pull together
Together we're strong, and we can become a people
And control our own destiny

For too many years we've been behind
Now it's time for us, to use our mind
One strong mind, we've got to think together

(Our people are beautiful!) And right and strong!
We've known this all along, so don't ever back up!
(We're black and proud!) Say it loud!
(We're people are proud!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

The man's got a way of tearing us down
Making us mess each other's around
Don't let him win, while he goes up with laughing grin
And don't you laugh and grin

Say it loud! (We're people and proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people and proud!)

It's been a long hard fight, and it's not all yet done
It won't be over, until we get what men should have
And that's respect, respect from your fellow man
Respect from the other man, mm-hmm...
It's gotta be all for one, it's gotta be all for one
Help me out, Fred!

It's gotta be all for one! (All for one!)
And one for all! (And one for all!)
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!
All for one! (All for one!)
And one for all! (And one for all!)
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!

Mmm, I feel like I wanna moan...
It's friend or warrior
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

[?], Du Bois, Martin Luther King
Mmm... it's all for one, one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we'll fall
It's all for one, one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we'll fall
It's all for one, huh, and one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we will fall

Uh, release me, release me!
Just let me think for myself, think for myself
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
A winner, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

It's all for one, and one for all!
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!
We've got to use the power of Soul
To drive us home to our final goal
We've got to unify, and we must pull together

(Our people are beautiful!) And right and strong!
We've known this all along, so don't ever back up!
(We're right and proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Martin Luther said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
[?] said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Du Bois said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Du Bois said...

Oh... I can see it now, yeah...
Yeah, I can see it too... this smile...
What from, moments... I can see it...
There are pink letters...
Very clear, right ahead of me... hey sister...
I can see it all night...!
Yes, I can see it too...

// Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me) //

Everybody gets down sometimes...
But who can I turn to (who can I turn to)
When nobody, nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know (no one James, no one James)
So I must go (no one James, no one James)
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me (no star to guide me)
And no one beside me (no one James)
I'll go on my way (till the day)
After the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow (maybe tomorrow)
Oh, I'll find what I'm after (ah...)
Mm, I'll throw off my sorrow (ooh...)
Beg, steal, or borrow
My, my, my share of laughter

With you I could learn to (ah...)
With you, oh, what a new day
But tell me, who can I turn to
Baby, if you, if you turn away?
Turn away, ah...

(Ah...) And maybe, and maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm, what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, plead, steal, or borrow!
Hey, my my my one last, my one last laughter

With you I could learn to...
With you, on a, on a, on a new day
But who can I turn to (who can I turn to)
Tell me, if you turn away? (if you turn away?)
Don't leave me, don't turn away
Don't say goodbye, don't turn away...

(This cat can sing fast, slow, funky, any kind of way!)
