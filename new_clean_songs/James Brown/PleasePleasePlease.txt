// Hold My Baby's Hand //

I don't mind, there's a way on ferry 
I don't mind, this load my baby make me carry 
I don't mind, everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand 

I don't mind, it's the way you fool me 
I don't mind, take all life to scoon me 
I don't mind, everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand 

Did you ever feel so low 
Did you ever feel so low 
Did you ever feel so bad 
And you mised all the fun 
That you thought you had 
When you feel so bad 
And you missed all the fun 
That you thought you bad 
Everything would be so grand 
If I can hold my, my baby's hand

// I Feel That Old Feeling Comin' On //

I, I, I feel that old feeling coming on
I, I, I feel that old feeling coming on 
I, I've been so unlucky over since I've been born 
Yeah, tell me pretty baby, tell me what you're gonna do 
Yeah, tell me pretty just what you're gonna do 
Yes you're gonna keep on running 
Let your woman make a fool of you 
Yes, I...
I feel, I feel that old feeling coming on 

I've been beautiful pretty baby 
Don't you know I've a scar 
I've been beautiful pretty baby 
Don't you know I've a scar 
I've been thinking about 
That sure hits the bone 
Yes just count all your tinbers 
Can you reach 21 
Yes just keep on counting baby 
You reach 21 
I'm so unlucky 
I'm my mother's seventh son 
Yeah I... 
I feel, I feel that old age coming on

// Just Won't Do Right //

Since you've been gone
I drink & gamble every night 
You just won't do right 

Tell me...
Am I the one 

Tell me...
Am I the one 

Tell me, tell me, am I the one
Since you've been gone I've been all alone
Waiting and watching for you
My heart is trying slowly bye and bye
Still, still for you

Since you've been gone
I drink & gamble every night
You just won't do right

// Baby Cries Over The Ocean //

Baby cries over the ocean 
Baby cries over the sea
Baby cries over the ocean
(Baby cries over the sea)
(Baby cries over the ocean)
Bring back my baby to me

Baby cries over the ricer
Baby cries over the park
Hold and I love her and I miss her
Sing about her in my song
Baby cries over the ocean
Bring back my baby to me

You can cry me a river
Cry me an ocean
I won't drown a mountain in tears
You know pretty baby
You give me a notion
It's your boyfriend that I do fear 
...

Baby cries over the ocean
Bring back my baby to me 

You can cry me a river
Cry me an ocean
I won't drown a mountain in tears
You know pretty baby
You give me a notion
It's your boyfriend that I do fear 

You can cry me a river
Cry me an ocean
I won't drown a mountain in tears
You know pretty baby
You give me a notion
It's your boyfriend that I do fear

// I Don't Know //

Oh I don't know...

Yes tell me baby 
Whatever I did wrong 
When I left pretty baby 
Did I stay too long 
You said I, I don't know

Now baby why did you put me down 
I didn't think there was anybody 
Who could take my place when I was around 
I tried to do my best 
As nice as I could 
But still you insist 
I didn't do what I should 
Now you just can't make a fool of everybody 
'Cause at the end 
Somebody gonna double cross you 
Gonna be your best friend 
One thing's for sure 
Was wherever you go 
You can always say 
I don't know 

I don't know 

Yes tell me baby 
Was it my best friend 
That loved you when I left 
And you keep lovin' him 'til the end 
You said I... 
I don't know 
I don't know

// Tell Me What I Did Wrong //

Walked up to my baby 
Walked right up to my baby 
Tell me what have I done wrong 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 

There something about you baby 
Something 'bout you baby 
That I just can't understand 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 
I phantom some other man 

Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time 
Hey let's have a mighty, mighty good time 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long 
I am still a worry on your mind 

Walked up to my baby 
Walked right up to my baby 
Tell me what have I done wrong 
I want to know that you still love me 
Have I been away too long

// That Dood It //

Now here's a story about 
Reppy old jive 
Ooh my my, my honey and me 
I've been diggin' a those stories 
About the west of Kansas that had been told 
Me & my baby out out there 
Dig up a mass of gold 
The minute we found the bare treasure 
I looked up to see 
A great big old lady foot jiving looking 
Dead on me 
And ain't that Dood it 
You know, ain't that Dood it 
I can have no more eyes 
For diggin' up no more gold on 

I grabbed what I had in one hand 
And my baby 'bout the other 
Against grabbed by coat tail and said 
Don't you go another farther 
I ripped of my coat when I was shaken insane 
But what really got my coat 
Was when I heard my baby scream 
Ain't that Dood it 
Ain't that Dood it 
'Cause I ain't going nowhere 
And leave my baby there no 

I put on my breeches and stopped dead in my trackes 
As much as I hated the idea 
I went crawling on back 
I said look here Mr. Giant 
As I raised slowly on one knee 
I'll do anything you say hand my baby to me 
Ain't that Dood it 
Ain't that Dood it 
He said you prefer to lose 
And I'll set your baby free no 

I said I'll make you a proposition 
It's up to you to choose 
Just leave your money or your honey 
One of the two you'll have to leave 
I said Mr. Giant I want to thank you 
For taking the load off my mind 
But when it comes to choose between my money 
And my honey 
I'd take my money 
What am I saying 
I mean my honey every time 
Ain't that Dood it 
You know ain't that Dood it 
Now the Giant got the money 
And I got my honey 
And everybody's feeling fine no

// I Walked Alone //

I walked alone yes that's true
I get the blues from thinkin' of you
And it hurts, yes, yes, I know it hurts
Though we're apart oh yes though we're apart

Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too

Baby if you be one more life
Baby take me in your arms at night
Baby case out all of man
Baby please, one more chance

Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too

Baby I just can't think about nobody but you
You know you're mine, yes everything you do
Baby give me my old romance

// No, No, No, No //

Well don't leave my baby no, no, no, no 
Don't leave my baby no, no, no, no 
Don't leave my baby no. no, no, no 
Don't go, don't go, don't go 

Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't lie, fool with my baby 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no, no 
Don't quit me baby no, no, no 

I've been shook, I've been loved 
I've been laid in my grave 
Told my friends my best pals 
Don't ever let you catch with my gal

// That's When I Lost My Heart //

Woke up this morning baby was gone 
Just so bad I was all alone 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 

She, she said she loved me 
What a way to take me 
Told her I wouldn't, I wouldn't understand 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 

(When I) I lost everything I had 
Baby went I lost you 
And you, you made me (you made me) feel so bad 
You just won't be true 

Baby you are on my mind 
You're leaving me 
I don't feel so vague in mind 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 
You know 

(When I) I lost everything I had 
Baby went I lost you 
And you, you made me (you made me) feel so bad 
You just won't be true 

Baby you are on my mind 
You're leaving me 
I don't feel so vague in mind 
I lost my baby 
That's when I, I lost my heart 
You know 

That's when I lost my heart

// Let's Make It //

Yeah pretty baby listen to what I say 
You will always pay my way 
Let me hear pretty baby 
Remember what you say 
Daddy I will always bring you my bread 
I feel so bad I just can't take it 
Come on honey and let's make it 
Baby you know you've got to move 
Ain't no stamina, ain't no groove 
Baby you know we've got to move 
Ain't no stamina, ain't no groove 
Baby you know we've got to move 
Move 

We'll party every day 
And give you all of my pay 
And all I can do pretty baby 
Is get on my knees and pray 

Hey baby you can't leave me this way 
But I want to tell you 
That I ought to make it today 
Tell me 
Baby tell me 
You know I feel so bad 
I just can't take it 
You know I feel so bad 

We'll party every day 
And give you all of my pay 
And all I can do pretty baby 
Is get on my knees and pray 

Come on honey and let's make it 
I just can't take it no more 
Let's make it

// Love Or A Game //

One of these days 
You gonna miss me 
So many ways 
Lord have mercy 
You gonna miss me 
I wanna know 
Is it love, is it a game 

And if it's love 
Can I, can I explain 
Tell me, Lord have mercy 
You know you told me 
That you love me 
That your love I'll always share 
But now baby hey 
You showed me 
'Bout your love, my love 
Will we compare 
I wanna know 
Is it love, is it a game 

And if it's love 
Can I, can I explain
