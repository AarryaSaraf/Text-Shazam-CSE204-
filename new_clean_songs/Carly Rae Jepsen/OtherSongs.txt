// Cup Of Tea //

A cup of tea, a cup of tea
I've been driving all night, you won't turn on your light that easily
A neon sign offers some shelter across the street
Guess I'll drink my trouble down with a cup of tea

You're over me, you're over me
I howl at your room like a wolf to the moon, going crazy
Ring one more time, it won't bring your footsteps down to me
Guess I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But it's getting cold in here, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I let it be, try to let it be
I'll be hot to your touch, you say I think too much, call me 'baby'
And it'll all be fine once you are walking up the street
'Til then I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But darling, it's getting cold in here, yeah, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

A cup of tea, a cup of tea
She's holding your waist like she'd give you a taste so easily
I won't cry, no, I'll just watch, and I will see
And I'll say my last goodbye with a cup of tea

// Cut To The Feeling //

I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on, we crossed the line
It was on this time
I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want, you want from me
Talk to me, baby

I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars (Hey)
Just like ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah (Woo)
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on, can't make it stop
Give me all you got
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your everything to me
Let's get real, baby

A chemical reaction, take me in your arms (Hey)
And make me ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah (Woo)
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah)

(Hey, woo)
(C'mon) Take me to emotion (Hey)
I want to go all the way (All the way)
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Take me to emotion (Take me, take me)
I want to go all the way
Show me devotion (Take me, take me)
And take me all the way (Take me, take me)
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me all the way (Ah-ah-ah)

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling (Oh), oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), oh yeah (Woo)
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles (Yeah), oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

I wanna cut through the clouds
Mm, cut to the feeling
I wanna dance on the roof, oh-oh-oh, yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling

// Dear You //

Dear you, I'm still
Thinking 'bout you and I
Can't seem to get you from my mind, no
It's true, I
Imagine us together and I
Won't pretend it doesn't feel just fine, oh
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm craving to be near you

Dear you, I want to
Share your flannel shirt
I want to share my joy and hurt
With you alone
If you taught me to
Knot your tie just right, could I maybe
Keep it for the night
With you attached, ha
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm aching to be near you

Could I slip into
Your arms just like
A puzzle piece
We fit so perfectly
Would I melt under
Your hidden charms and
Close my eyes and fall so desperately
For my dear, dear, dear you (dear you)
I'm waiting to be near you

Dear you, you are the
Only one for me
No one else
Could win each game, you see
And still have my heart, oh
You see, I'm so
Distracted by your smile, I'm so
Attracted all the while
It's hard to speak
My dear, dear, dear you
I'm dying to be near you

Could I slip into
Your arms just like
A puzzle piece
We fit so perfectly
Would I melt under
Your hidden charms and
Close my eyes and fall so desperately
For my dear, dear, dear you (dear you)
One day I will be near you

Yours most sincerely, completely
So loving and dearly
Dearly from me

// Don't Speak //

You and me
We used to be together
Every day together
Always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
Well, they can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening
As we die
Both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(No, no, no)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
We gotta stop pretending
Who we are

You and me
I can see us dying
Are we?

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(No, no)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak
Don't speak
Don't speak, oh

I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Don't, don't, ooh, ooh

Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

// Everywhere You Look (The Fuller House Theme) //

1-2-3-4!
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la

Whatever happened to predictability?
The milkman, the paperboy, the evening TV?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please
'Cause this old world is just really confusing me

Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
"Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
'Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

Everybody eventually
Says that they're as lost as you
So everybody shout it together
"Hey, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look

When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look, yeah

When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la

// I Still Wonder //

I think its time we had that conversation again
I've been making you a habit since I don't wonder when

Summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for

In case you didn't notice you got me jumping in my skin
I am the shyest of the boldest whenever I let again

Summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for

Oh, summers almost here you don't have to say no more
But I still wonder what it is I met you for

// In My Bedroom //

So yeah he loves me
And I miss him too
'Cause he felt so constant
Which is something new

Lined flowers, hazelnut oils, and him
Vanilla scents massage into your skin

We danced in my bedroom
Thought we could see the moon

And for the weekend baby you stay by my side
When Monday comes I know a spot where you can hide
My room is small but it holds all the world inside
I'll keep your secrets if you'll just confide

Let's dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Some things are meant to be
I bet you were made for me

And if he asks me I'd do anything he'd say
Anything to help him drive the fear away
And just to keep him here for one more perfect day
I'll tell you there's no price I wouldn't pay

Let's dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Close every curtain
So it's just me and you (Yeah)
Some things are meant to be
I think you were made for me

A candle flickers and the shadows catch my eye
I'm praying that we never have to say good by
His breathing hums to me this gentle lullaby
I watch the ceiling but I see the sky

We dance in my bedroom
Where we can see the moon
Close every curtain
So it's just me and you
Some things are meant to be
I thin you were made for me

// It Takes Two //

[Lil Yachty:]
This ain't your regular party
This ain't your regular, no, no
(Ear Drummers!)
This ain't your regular party
This ain't your regular, no
(Mike WiLL Made It)
Hit it!

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Lil Yachty:]
I wanna rock right now
I'm Lil Yachty, now I'm down if you're down
I'm not the most lyrical kid known
But I'm known to keep the party goin'
'Cause my team's the livest, bright as a fly is
King of the teens, I speak to all ages
We in sync while goin' through all phases
Positivity is what made us famous, well...
So much endurance I shoulda ran track
Sauce so good, parme' still get a plaque
'Cause it takes two to carry all the big things
It takes two to end up with a shiny ring
'Cause it takes two to end up with the finer things
If you rush through the film you might miss the better scenes

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Lil Yachty):]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
(Hit it!)

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
Now look what you made do
You and me, baby it takes two
Bringin' new moves to the old school
Time for the whole world to enjoy the view
We can go left, they can go right
Save me a dance for the end of the night
When I'm with you it's a party
Don't care where we're goin'
The crew's on the floor and
I wanna keep goin'
So let's keep it goin'
Let's keep it goin'
And one and two and three and four

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Lil Yachty):]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
(Hit it!)

[Lil Yachty:]
Lil Boat!
It takes two to make a thing go right
When you're way too fly, team about to take flight
I don't know what you've been told
It takes two just like hot and cold
We go hand in hand like the sand and toes
It takes two just like silver and gold
Yeah it takes two like the dice been rolled
Team too clean, we the new dream team
We just wanna dance, we just wanna have fun
Slow down, let it rock until the sun come
Wasn't much to share but we all had some
'Cause it takes two comin' from where I come from

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Lil Yachty:]
Aight now
Y'all know Mike WiLL, you know
When I count to three I want you to get busy now
One, two, three, get loose now

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
It takes two, it takes two, it takes
It takes, it takes two
It takes, it takes two
It takes two, it takes two
It takes two, it takes two
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two
It takes, it takes two
It takes, it takes
It takes two
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
One and two and three and four
It takes two

// Lalala (Remix) //

[(Bbno$ & Y2K), Carly Rae Jepsen, & {Both}:]
Did I really just forget that melody?
(Naw, na, na, banananananana) Dada, yeah
(Alright), {dada dadadada}

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
When I popped off, then they all call me, maybe later, I can't talk now
Carly so cold, she from the north, she from the Canada
Forty-five dates, I'm on the road
And you know I always sell out the show
[Bbno$:]
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
Let's give it a vibe

[Bbno$:]
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cómo se mueve mi mucha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Ay, mami, cuando tú te agacha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cómo lo mueve mi mucha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
How I stride like that

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
I'm not really looking for a ring
I'm pretty but I'll never send a pic
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Got money, but I still want him to pay

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
When I popped off, then they all call me, maybe later, I can't talk now
Carly so cold, she from the north, she from the Canada
Forty-five dates, I'm on the road
And you know I always sell out the show
[Bbno$, (Carly Rae Jepsen & bbno$):]
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
(How I stride like that)

[Bbno$, with (Carly Rae Jepsen):]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how, (how I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how, (how I stride like that)

[Enrique Iglesias:]
Vamo' a darle al cuerpo más de ritmo
Pa' que no sea más de lo mismo
Te voy diciendo cosas al oído
Tú sabe' que lo nuestro es divertido (Yeah)
Va-va-vamo' a pedirno' otra ronda
Un poco 'e reggaetón pa' entrar en onda
Es un avión que prende la turbinas
Que vuela y chupa mucha gasolina (Ey)

[Bbno$, with (Carly Rae Jepsen):]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
I shine my wrist, it go like (shashasha, shashasha)
I got your bitch singing like (lalala, lalala)
(How I stride like that)

// Me And The Boys In The Band //

On the road for half the year
And I can't remember loneliness
And it feels like that says something about you
Or something 'bout me
Performance and the after party
And it took a little time I guess
But I found that I'm not thinking about you
Or thinking 'bout us

Then we pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go
Driving all night to make that show
I'll be a whole new girl tomorrow
It's a new city, so pretty, eyes closed

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band
Just me and the boys in the band

Now and then a memory sparks
Like violins still break my heart
And I feel that says something about you
Or something about me
One day we will meet as friends
But I am not good at pretending
You were so good at pretending

Hey, but now I pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go
Driving all night to make that show
I'll be a whole new girl tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, eyes closed

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

So just take me to the stage
It's been home from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I've got the summer heart!
So just take me to the stage
It's been lit from the start
I need the summer heart
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)
Just me and the boys in the band

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah (hey!)
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band (With the boys in the band)
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

So just take me to the stage
It's been home from the start (hey!)
Summer nights, summer days (Just me and the boys)
I've got the summer heart (hey!)
So just take me to the stage
It's been lit from the start
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

On the road for half the year
And "Real Love" is just a song I guess
And it feels like that says something about you
Or something about me

// OMG //

No chemical could recreate our chemistry
Got what I need, need, need
I'm technical, but I lose sensibility
When you're next to me

I feel a boom, feel a bang inside my soul, love
When you lay me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
Of my senses now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Ooh now) (Hey)

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high, high, high
When you whisper in my ear, I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night

I feel the boom, feel the bang from head to toe, love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
You know you got me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Ooh now) (Hey)

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
And when you're gone, you should know that you're all that I'm wanting
And I'll always be feeling the same

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you, ah
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my God
I think I might love you
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you (I think I might love you)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

// Part Of Your World //

Maybe he's right
Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just, I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
(You want thingamabobs? I got twenty)
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
(What do ya call 'em?) Oh - feet
Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
(What's that word again?) Street

Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
(What's the word?) Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world

// Take A Picture //

Flying kites
With boy wonder
Hold tight
To me all summer
Reading my
Magazines
Dancing
In my blue jeans
Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
For everybody to see
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light

(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
Save the light

Fireworks
And night streamers
Baby blue
With the day dreamers
Under water
Close to me
Hold my breath
In my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
For everybody to see
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save

I wanna live
Tonight
I wanna save
The light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live
We wanna live

I wanna live
Tonight
I wanna save
The light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live
We wanna live

And tonight
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
And tonight
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light

// To Be Without You //

If you never see my face
You won't see a trace of what I'm going through
And I'm going through
A lot for you
I can see that you don't care
And I'm scared to fall without you
It's so hard to fall
Without you

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
And I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

I've been living for your eyes
For that second you might turn to see me
Can you see me
Really see me
Now I see it's all a lie
That I've lived inside my own illusion
All this meaning
Means nothing

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

I, I get so lonely
Oh, and
I am so lost
Lost, lost

So I get myself upright
Try to dream of anything but you tonight
'Cause waking up
Is a losing fight
Yeah, the dream just doesn't last
And I wake to realize the truth too fast
And I'm wishing
For my past

To be without you
A sea with no shore
To live without you
Is like a room without a door
Oh, and I keep wishing I could break free
If you would come back here
And free me

If you never see my face
You won't see a trace of what I'm going through
And I'm going through
A lot for you

// Tonight I'm Getting Over You (Remix) //

[Nicki Minaj:]
This is the remix
Re-re-mix. Carly

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you
Over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying (No more crying)
To get me through (To get me through)
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

[Nicki Minaj:]
Tonight I'm getting over
Meditate and do my yo-ger
Then I pull up to the club in a Rover
A Celine bag on my shoulder
I said rrr
Cock that revolver
Rrrr-Rrrr that's that nostal-ger
I said I'm number one, I'm a son of a gun
And runner-up is what they called ya (woo)
Ain't tryna be mean but
I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!
Get me get me, should've got me then (Tonight, I'm getting—)
'Cause I would wear for real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen? (Tonight, I'm getting over you)
'Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in!

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
(Oh) Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you (Tonight)
Tonight, I'm getting over you (Oh) over you

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Nicki Minaj):]
We're not lovers (Tonight, I'm getting—)
But more than friends (Tonight, I'm getting—)
Put a flame to every (Tonight, I'm getting—) single word you ever said (Tonight, I'm getting over you)
No more crying (Pretty gang)
To get me through (Rich Gang, Young Money)
I'll keep dancing (Nicki Minaj) 'til the morning with somebody new
(I see you, Carly)
Tonight (Let's get it), I'm getting over you
