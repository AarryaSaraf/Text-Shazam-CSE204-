Get up, let's boogie all

For the boogie there is no beginning
And there is no end, ha

// Sunshine And Love //

I was working one cold, wet and rainy day
With no place to go
You came and showed me a better way
Out of the rain
Like a light switch on the wall
You turned me on, sunshine and love
You gave my life so much warmth and joy
Sunshine and love

I'm so glad that he gave you to me, yeah, baby
Now my life is finally complete

Sunshine and love
Sunshine and love

I'm so glad that he gave you to me, yeah, baby
Now my life is finally complete

Like the flowers in the spring
You sure did bring your good, good love to me
Yeah, yeah, ooh-wee, baby
Sunshine and love, sunshine and love, yeah
(Sunshine and love)

Came into my life with so much warmth and joy
You made me such a happy boy
Oh, yeah, yes, sir
(Sunshine and love)

Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine and love
Ooh-wee, baby
You made my life so complete
Ooh-wee, baby, knock me off my feet, yeah, ooh...
(Sunshine and love)

Like a taste of honey, you sure are sweet
Oh, baby, ooh, baby, yeah, yeah
I just don't know, I just don't know
What I would do without your sweet
Good, good lovin', yeah, yeah
(Sunshine and love)

I just wanna put my arms around you, yeah
Hold you tight, yeah, all through the night
(Sunshine and love)

// Mother Earth //

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

A woman she is, mother of us all, y'all
Spinning around, keeping man tall

And she's always there sharing her love between us
Guiding all the years she knows before us
(Loving, giving, caring, sharing, giving, loving)
And Mother Earth goes spinning around
And spinning around and spinning around

Mother Earth, she spins around, round and around
Spinning around, making no sound
All the children of the Earth to who she gave birth
Always came first, for better or worse

Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...
Shoo-be-do-be-do-do-de-do...

And she's always there sharing her love between us
Guiding all the years she knows before us
(Loving, giving, caring, sharing, giving, loving)
And Mother Earth goes spinning around
And spinning around and spinning around

// Winter Sadness //

When autumn leaves
Fall to the ground
And their colours change red and brown
The smell of chestnuts roasting in the air
That let's us know she's almost here
Winter sadness
