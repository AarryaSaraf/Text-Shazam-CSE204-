Anything just to please you
And we're gonna move on

Love will make us feel alright
Steppin' out
This is your night
Steppin' out, with my baby
Come on, baby
Steppin' out
Steppin' out

// Pass It On //

Pass the love on

There's so many things we have, we shared for so long
Now the time has come for us to pass it on
Little children come, they go so fast
Let us teach them well so that this world can last

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on 
To their hearts and minds, pass the love on 
To their souls, pass the love on
To the little children, pass it on

So many good hearts born to do great things
To help us feel the music that this life can bring
So many came before as brighter stars
To show us what was alive and show us who we are

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on
From your heart and mind, pass the love on
From your soul, pass the love on
Through the generations, pass it on

Pass it on, pass the love on
In your heart and mind, pass the love on
In your soul, pass the love on
In your mind, baby, pass it all

And every child will know just to live on
They were born for greater things to be stars
As generations come and go so fast
The love we leave are less than that we last

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on
In your heart and mind, pass the love on
In your soul, pass the love on
For the little children, pass the love on

Pass the love, oh baby, yeah
Pass the love on
You would feel so much better if you share it
Pass the love on
Through all the ages and time, oh yeah
Pass it all, pass the love on

// No Show //

I thought at last love came to pass
In my life there was a chance
To believe in someone new
Love finally came

We waited for the perfect day
You and I would slip away
Become one inside our dreams

Oh, but I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
No show
You never showed, never came

You said your love was strong for me
I must face reality
I believed and called your name
You never came

Now I'm alone on my way home
Just a fool who played the game
With a love I thought I knew

Oh yes, I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I tried to hide my emotions
But my lips kept on saying your name
No show

I thought at last love came to pass
In my life was a chance
To believe in someone new like you

We waited for that perfect day
For you and I would slip away
Become one inside our dreams

Oh, but I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came
No show
You never showed, never came

You never came
Hurt me so bad, baby
Why didn't you show in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

I thought that you loved me
When you and I had made our plans, baby
We waited for the perfect day
Darling, I stood in the falling rain
You never showed, never came

Stood in the falling the rain
And you never showed never came
I tried to hide my emotions
But my lips kept sayin' your name
