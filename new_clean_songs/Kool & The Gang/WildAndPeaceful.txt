// Heaven At Once //

Kool, you know I've been thinkin'
What do we need to make things
Better in the world today

You know that's a beautiful thought
We need peace, we need unity
We need peace for you and me

You know because we are so blind
We can't see, we cannot see the creator of a tree
The creater of a bee, the creator of you and me

What are you doin' to make things better
Well, you see we are scientists of sound
We're mathematically puttin' it down

And you know we're tryin' to find the key to the light
What do you mean by the key to the light
Well, brother you see, from the darkness came the light

We need that light to find peace and unity
Because there's so much illusion and confusion
So much destruction, so much corruption

What could I do
Well, you know that's why we have to save the children
Because you're gonna play a very important part

So you must continue to strive and bring this peace and unity
Because there's only way we can find heaven
Through peace and unity

Would that be heaven?
Yes, you know that would be heaven at once

Heaven at once, ooh heaven
Heaven at once, ooh heaven
Heaven at once
Heaven at once
Ooh heaven, heaven at once

Yes, it would be heaven at once

// This Is You, This Is Me //

Cryin' babies on the doorstep,
Helpless as can be,
Lady of the evening,
Set your mind free.
Grown up in a ghetto,
Never seen a tree, oh...

If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on you,
It's on me

If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on you,
It's on me, yeah

If you try to make it better,
Try to pull it in
You take it from your pocket,
You'll take it from within, yeah
You'll take it from your pride, y'all,
You're right back where you been, yeah.
It's sort of like a seesaw
Up and down again.
The key is in vacation?

If you don't understand
The words to this song,
It's on you,
It's on me

If you don't understand,
don't get me wrong,
It's on you,
It's on me, yeah.

[Sax solo]

If you don't understand
The words to this song,
It's on me,
It's on you, yeah.

If you don't understand,
don't get me wrong,
It's on you
It's all about you and me, ya'll

[A second sax solo]

Cryin' babies
On the doorstep

Grown up in a ghetto,
Never seen a tree

If you don't understand
The words to this song,
It's on me,
It's on you

If you don't understand,
Don't get me wrong,
It's on me,
It's on you

// Life Is What You Make It //

Think about what it means to live

The time to live and love your life is now yours
The time to learn to love yourself is now yours
To live and find yourself your love is all right yours
When you learn to do the things, you're on your way

The time to find the things you want is now yours
The time to get the things you need is now yours
The things you need when times get tough get now yours
When you learn to do the things, you've got to say

Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
When you do your things, that's not the way

Yeah, hey hey, yeah

The time to live and love your life is now yours
The time to learn to love yourself is now yours
To live and find yourself your love is all right yours
When you learn to do the things, yeah

Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
