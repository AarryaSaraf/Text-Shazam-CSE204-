Album: Telefone

// Yesterday //

And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul

And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul

Who am I? Gypsy rap
Gypsy need her dollar back
And all of that
My devil is only closer when I call him back
Liquor in a limelight
Look her in the limelight
With fine wine and ecstasy
You can have the rest of me
Basket case silhouette, cigarette, internet
Check my twitter page for something Holier than black death
Who am I, Gypsy black
The vacancy of hallelu
Me hollow in my interviews
Me only wearing tennis shoes to clubs with dress codes
Cause fuck they clubs
Everything is everything
Me Noname, you niggas doing cocaine
Me missing brother Mike, like something heavy
Me heart just wasn't ready
I wish I was a kid again

[Akenya, TheMIND, Noname:]
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday

When I remember memories don't last forever
When I deny my empty with an open letter
Who gon remember me?
My satellite, my empathy
The wheels be chrome, chrome spiffy, the Lord with me
My halo said goodbye and the floor hit me
Fill the lining in the pine box, my granny fill the time slot
"Don't grow up too soon
Don't blow the candles out
Don't let them cops get you"
My granny almost Sparrow I can see the wings
The choir sings
And la da di la di da da da, dah
Only he can save my soul
And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul

[Akenya, TheMIND, Noname:]
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday

When the sun is
When the sun is
When the sun is
When the sun is going down

// Sunny Duet //

[TheMIND:]
Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I'm not around

[Noname:]
I used to have a name that look like butterflies and Hennessey
I'd trade it up for happiness but joyful don't remember me
I'm sitting on my front lawn waiting for him to call me
He said he knew my name
Shame on me, fool me once, shame on you
I got my candy cane
My name is hella pimping too
You could watch a player move
Oh we could call this ice cream in my Sunday sweater
Patent leather tethered to a fancy car
I know you wanna touch me
In your old religion caviar
Holy water avatar
Blue like the tears when I left you
I met you on Saturday morning
It's raining it's storming
I approach me with caution
I come with a warning

[TheMIND:]
You sweep me off my feet
I'll probably clean my act up
I swear I'll be on my best behavior
From this day forward, a lifetime after
If you're my baby
And I know this world is so damn crazy
(And I know this world is oh so crazy)
But that don't mean a thing
It can forgive me, hate me, call me crazy
As long as you know my name

[Noname:]
I use to dream in parables
Partially love you naturally
Happily ever after
Cigarette over blunts now
Miracle Whip at Funtown
Summertime delight, delight
Mississippi over ice
Janet Jackson and flashing lights
We can dance a little, if you'd like to
My vagabonds is a lonely road, a celebrated haiku
Contemporary overzealous think I really like you
Sing with me, sing with me paranoia light blue
Piano was a deep red, your fingers were a green hue
I should make a rainbow out of sacrificial love in the club
Of the ollie ollie, feeling holy
The DJ was religion
I swear on the pope he know me

[TheMIND:]
Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I'm not around

// Diddy Bop //

[Noname:]
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready

This sound like Mississippi sippy cup, daddy turn bibby up
Henny invented the catalyst for happiness in my cup
This sound like kiddies on the playground when mama was running up
Ooooooh, you about to get your ass beat
This sound like niggas complaining when their bitches like Raz-B
B2K in the stereo, we juke in the back seat
Or juke in the basement, in love with my KSWISS's
This feel like jumping in a pool and I'm knowing I can't swim
Ooooooh, you about to get your ass beat
For stealing that twenty dollars like "baby, just ask me"
Mama say she love, love, loved us
When the lights was off we had to stay with cousins
Granny at the BBQ with petty ass husband
Summertime, city life, Chi-town, my town, my town
After school matters like I'm needing that stipend right now
Kennicott parking lot got caught with the blunt like "wow wow"

Run, run, run, mama say come home
Before the streetlights do
Ice cream on my front porch
In my new FUBU and my A1's too
Watching my happy block
My whole neighborhood hit the Diddy bop

[Cam O'bi:]
This sound like growing out my clothes
With stars in my pocket, dreaming bout making my hood glow
This sound like every place I would go, if I could fly
This feel like every summertime
Fall asleep dreaming bout all the places I could go
And every one of them feels so close, still chasing time

[Raury:]
And I am not a star, I am a meteor
On a crash course towards Earth across the cosmos
Versus Perseus to the father
Of his birth to tell the truth, that I'm his real son
Get blocked, I'ma build one
Get blocked, I'ma build two
Hope that you see it's a staircase
Still pray for a fair day
Where they give a fair race to the marinade
And the dogons and the eses and the fair-faced
Keith H. when I peel paint
Rainbows with a pink blue
And a sea foam type of green hue
Make a clear space
Stop overreacting, it's past my curfew I'm out after 6
Happily making my accident
Mama gon' whoop on my ass again
Pray that I'm making my way before 8
And I might have to sneak in the back again
Hope that Memorial traffickin'
Hope that she stopping for gas again
Girl I just want to relax again
Pray you gon' bring that shit back again
Pray you gon' bring that shit back again
I know

[Noname:]
Run, run, run, mama say come home
Before the streetlights do
Ice cream on my front porch
In my new FUBU and my A1's too
Watching my happy block
My whole neighborhood hit the Diddy bop

[Cam O'bi:]
This sound like growing out my clothes
With stars in my pocket, dreaming 'bout making my hood grow
This sound like every place I would go, if I could fly
This feel like every summertime
Fall asleep dreaming bout all the places I could go
And every one of them feels so close, still chasing time

[Noname:]
Watching my happy block
My whole neighborhood hit the Diddy bop
Watching my happy, watching my happy ooh ooh
Watching my happy block
My whole neighborhood hit the Diddy bop

// All I Need //

[Background:] 
"It was great, apparently I've never been on live television before..."

[Noname:]
Noname off the drugs
Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight
Love is all I need
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say

Like maybe Imma miss you after autumn
And all of the fallen callers and ringers
When singers hittin my tele
And tele paging my beeper
The reefer got me like "whoa, slow down"
I need a minute for minute's sake, a dinner plate
A casanova with catalogs of his dinner dates
Make me feel special, Jay Electro-Soul
I need a nigga to follow me to the rabbit hole
And fall in where I fall in
I'm ballin' I'm out control
I'm ballin' I'm out control

[SPZRKT:]
You say you see a way that
I can not see, then say that
I never knew it all
I'm just trying not to fall
And now I'm chasing patience
I need it for greatness
Look at this time I'm wasting
Mad at how it ended
Really, If I tell the truth about it

If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it [x4]

[Noname:]
Everything is everything
A cigarette for wedding ring
And tell me that you love me and love me tomorrow
The matrimony catalyst for secondary
Get to know me in Chicago
How I go where you stay
Unorthodox paradox in a pair of Doc's
With an overbite, oversight to a merry clock
Happy go lucky was a time, you and I
Happy go lucky was a time, do or die
You remind me to love myself for the principle
For the kid inside, til the end of time
Happy go lucky was a time, umm okay

[Noname:]
Noname off the drugs
Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight
Love is all I need
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say

[SPZRKT:]
You say you see a way that
I can not see, then say that
I never knew it all
I'm just trying not to fall
And now I'm chasing patience
I need it for greatness
Look at this time I'm wasting
Mad at how it ended
Really, If I tell the truth about it

If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it [x4]

// Reality Check //

[Noname:]
Opportunity knockin
A nigga was out for coffee
Inadequate like my window
The Grammy's is way too lofty
And I could stay here forever
I could die here
I don't have to try here
Can I get my two sugars please?
Jesus made an album
I'm still waiting in the line for cream
She dream in techni-color
Live black and white
Opportunity knockin
A nigga just got her nails done
Skeletons in my closet gone open the door when Yale come
They ain't gonna wanna see my silhouette rap
He's fucking cognac
My smile in all black
Mississippi vagabond
Granny gone turn up in her grave
And say, my granny really was a slave for this
All your uncompleted similes and pages ripped
You know they whipped us niggas
How you afraid to rap it
You went to heaven after so we could free them now
Ain't no ocean floor when you can be a yeezus now

[Eryn Allen Kane:]
Don't fear the light
That dwells deep within
You are powerful
Beyond what you imagine
Just let your light glow

[Noname:]
Seventeen moments and cloudy days on my snap
Mysterious aberration, illuminated the trap
My telefone-calications synonymous with the sunrise
Mountains against the foreground forever me coming back
I ain't gonna cry
The last time Ali marched Chicago
Twenty four and a late mojo teaching me how to drive
Whole world inside my rear view
This feel in me so alive
This feel in me so alive
Enjoy the joyride
Opportunity knockin'
It's finally time to answer
The doorbell was only broken cause auntie was fighting cancer
Cigarettes on my mantle keep callin me by my first name
Loving me when I'm lonely
Pretending they really Noname

[Eryn Allen Kane:]
Don't fear the light
That dwells deep within
You are powerful
Beyond what you imagine
Just let your light glow

[Akenya:]
And when that call comes
(You better)
You better say hello
No hesitation
(you better)
No hiding, deep down below
(you better)
No beg your pardon
(you better)
You better stay and grow
Your liberation
(you better)
For your lonely soul
You'll be on your own

// Freedom (Interlude) //

I thought I was gone write a rap
I thought I was gone...

I thought I was gone write a rap
But this be baby miracle
Virginity in karat gold
Alphabet in the cereal
I'll forget why I'm here alone
Sentiment for a different song
Let's get back to IG
Open the DM
I think he like me
Asiatic black man
Affinity with lap dance
The walls is caving
The laws is changing
Bill Cosby ain't the god we made him
They all forgave him
I think I wrote a song about confusion and perception
Messages in bottles
Disillusion on the guest list
You said plus one
So where your plus one at?
I hope he find his way to Arizona now
I hope he find Fatima and she hold him down

What a pretty lady in the valley of the shadows
I'm thinking she lost a battle
I'm thinking she found the bottle
Blueberry bubblegum bassinet in my hideout
Baby said turn the lights low
Momma said go to bed now
I had a dream I rocked my baby fast asleep
Count the toes
They're all there
Kiss the cheek
I think this is a song about redemption
Or a mother's intuition
How my kitchen sounds like church bells
Why they sell me, my dollar, and my dream?
White picket fence
Crop of the cream
I know this is a song for overcoming
And me coming
And me running out of ways to....  really uhh

Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
I know I'm free
Dance with me
I know I'm free

[Peter Rodis:] Well what's free to you?
[Nina Simone:] What's free to me? Same thing it is to you, you tell me
[Peter Rodis:] No, you tell me
[Nina Simone:] Just a feeling... It's just a feeling. It's like how do you tell somebody how it feels to be in love? How are you going to tell anybody who has not been in love how it feels to be in love? You cannot do it to save your life. You can describe things, but you can't tell them. But you know it, when it happens. That's what I mean by "free". I had a couple times on stage when I really felt free, and that's something else. That's really something else! I'll tell you what freedom is to me: No fear!

// Casket Pretty //

All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring

I've been searching for God in the bottle he gave me
Ashes to Ashes, dearly departed, regarded as Holy
Dont hold me, dont hold me
When niggas is dying and dying
And I'm afraid of the dark
Blue and the white
Badges and pistols rejoice in the night
And we watch the news
And we see him die tonight
Tonight the night his baby said goodbye
Roses in the road, teddy bear outside
Bullet there on the right
Where's love when you need it
Too many babies in suits
Too many babies in suits
Back before the dawn
Ricochet the pawn
Bullet in the chest
You ain't mean no harm
Collecting your check mate
I know you in love with the power
Its flowers at every occasion
I need me a medicine man
Somebody heal me
Somebody take my hand

All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring

// Forever //

Miss Nina Simone, Jimmy Jones
Missy Elliot musically were my relatives
Never forget my Andre
Papi mi casa es su casa
Baby I made an entrée
Maybe I make your moms plate
Maybe we not gon' sleep tonight
In the night you and I laugh about how you Gemini
Already fry the chicken
But leftovers was my inner thigh
Nah I'm lying, I'm just playing
You can read this book with me
I'm trying to re-imagine abracadabra for poverty
Like poof I made it disappear
Proof I'm made of happiness
Everything is everything
But I still haven't paid my rent
Ugly is ugly
So molly makes them joyful now
When I get down, I'm already up
Molly the water, I keep the drink in the cup
My druggy is druggy we just some kids out of luck
Ooooh they ain't tryna' see me shine my shine
A bullet on my time, my time
Fuck it, I'll live forever now

[Noname, Ravyn Lenae:]
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But Fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day
Follow in the rain
You know that we live forever
How long will it take?
To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever

I sold my name for seven bags of skittles
On Sunny Set Boulevard
Please tell me God is rainbow pretty
Mystery and fully charged
Nobody understands my songs
Aloe vera sentences to heals the scars
Of rental cars to Malibu to Shangri-La
Ooh, my cigarette burning, my momma be calling
She worry about me, her girl alcoholic
And I can take a trip to L.A
And I can lose myself inside myself
I hope the Lord forgives me now
Why I still be thrifting accustomed to
Wearing hand-me-downs
Why my cinderella a cinder block
For my family now
I can't build no mansion on top of these shaggy bones
I left my home I'm on, the road forgive me
There she go again, her dark consumerism
Assimilated in him, cash the new gospel
Occupational sin, just walked out of the church house
With happy all in my pocket, a little something to spent

[Noname, Ravyn Lenae:]
They ain't tryna' see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't tryna' see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day
Follow in the rain
You know that we live forever
How long will it take?
To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever

[Joseph Chilliams:]
We gon live forever like Aaliyah
Look how they did Rekia
Honestly I'm just happy I can be here
Hoping I don't offend all my peers
When I say that ass is a mouthful like kujichagulia
Following bright ideas, cause I'm victim to colorism
They flood the prison, no difference hanging from trees
When they gon leave the system I notice we still ain't free
In this club trying to ban me cause my white tee
I mean like high key
I was choosen to fight in a pair of Mikes
Over polite holding a knife
They hold my live in low regards hoping I'm hopeless
But I've been in love for so long like Janet Jackson poems
I know I'm terrible
But I'm focused like a variable
Emitting phernomones so I dont got to bear it alone
Nina Simone biopic made me swear at my home
Gotta call someone so I can tell them on my telefone

[Noname, Ravyn Lenae:]
They ain't trying to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But Fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But Fuck it, we'll live forever
Forever in a day
Follow in the rain
You know that we live forever
How long will it take?
To marry the sunset
If it ain't us yet forever

// Bye Bye Baby //

Interview, interlude in the nude with my boo thang
Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
I swear he love me
My tummy almost got ready
For biddi-baby spaghetti
And teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile
Before you leave, don't look down
God will help you spread your wings

My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey

Ask me why she said goodbye
Why baby dyin' white walls
Cigarette's over skyfall
Writing this life, this my song
Ask me why she hesitated
Almost waited, waiting room
Play date up to heaven soon
Soon I will see the King
He reminds me
Some give presents before they're even ready
I could see that she loves me
I know her heart is heavy

Telefone-ication nation
Baby help me testify
Oooh you know I hate goodbye
Bye bye blue
Somebody let the yellow end
Bye bye blue
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us

// Shadow Man //

[Phoelix, TheMIND, Cam O'bi:]
How do you see me?
How do you love me?
How to do you remember me?
Amaurotic nightingale
I hope that darkness keeps you well
When I can't fall asleep at night
I blindly taught myself to fight
Aw shadow man shadow box, please keep your hands up
And if you get knocked down don't forget to stand up
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale (I pray it keep you well)
Darkness keep you well

[Noname:]
Shadow man shadow box, dance in the dark with me
This resurrected agony there's apathy for caskets
Everything I ever loved I lost in the magic
I claim by the river, my body delivered
When I die there's 27 rappers at my funeral
Moses wrote my name in gold and Kanye did the eulogy
Remember all the bashfulness, understand the truancy
Here I stand in front of a college dropout
My music was a church when my spirit hopped out
Met a gypsy in LA and she reading my palm tree
Mysterious situation like kissing the concrete i.e getting money
I been close to heaven
Baby claim he love me, hold me down forever
I never should have bought this halo
He waiting for me at his table
My funeral a Disney fable
Cause the king bout to take me home

[Saba:]
Preach, church, tabernacle, Tallahassee sunshine
Southern is my bloodline we know it'll come time...to go
And though I leave like alumni
I'm lying like a lullaby and quiet like my tongue tied...alone
Bury me in satin, tell the pastors say the sad shit same class with the whole...first row
And if ashes turn to ashes then I'm back in my first form with a dust storm with a corner...and coke
Morbid or late, Lord give Lord take
Viva la muerte, mortal man
Less love, more hate
More like mortician, we meet our fate
Funeral home lookin like a home that I used to live in
You wasn't supposed to go so soon I took it for granted
Maybe we'll meet the next life, maybe another planet
Open my soul but then it'll end with an open casket

[Smino:]
Uh ay
Tippy toe on a tightrope
Leaning on green and it gon be a dice roll
I'm feenin a feline who mindset Afeni
I got two packs for us
Gold on my gumline done got rich off my tongue
Sticky dro in the tight roll
Cleaning my grievances
As a lil' heathen I
Sat pledge allegiance out
Never believed in yall
System I needed more
And I done went Figaro with the finger roll
Landed wrong split my head, start leaking songs
And I'm worser than they worst, they make a nigga live forever
Flock with them birds, my heart stay lighter than a feather
It's gon be niggas boomin' at my funeral
Tell em play Metro Boomin' at my funeral
St. Louis taught me death could be your neighbor, stay away
Don't take the family for granted better days await

[Phoelix, TheMIND, Cam O'bi:]
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
