// The Bonny Bunch Of Roses //

Near by the swelling ocean
One morning in the month of June
While feather'd warbling songsters
Their charming notes did sweetly tune
I overheard a lady
Lamenting in sad grief and woe
And talking with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny Bunch of Roses, O
Thus spake the young Napoleon
And grasp'd his mother by the hand
"Oh, mother dear have patience
Till I am able to command
I'll raise a numerous army
And through tremendous dangers go
And in spite of all the universe
I'll gain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O"
Oh, son, speak not so venturesome
For England is the heart of oak
Of England, Scotland, and Ireland
The unity can ne'er be broke
And think you on your father

In the Island where he now lies low
He is not yet interred in France
So beware of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O
Your father raised great armies
And likewise kings did join the throng
He was so well provided
Enough to sweep the world along
But when he went to Moscow
He was o'erpower'd by drifting snow
And though Moscow was blazing
He lost the bonny Bunch of Roses, O
"Oh, mother, adieu for ever
I am now on my dying bed
If I had liv'd I'd have been brave
But now I droop my youthful head
And when our bones do moulder
And weeping-willows o'er us grow
Its deeds to bold Napoleon
Will stain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O"

// Close The Door Lightly When You Go //

One, two, three

Turn around, don't whisper out my name
Like a breeze, it would stir a dying flame
I'll miss someone, if it eases you to know
And close the door lightly when you go

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Take your tears from someone else's eyes
They're made of glass
And they cut like wounded knives
Memories, they're drifting like the snow
And close the door lightly when you go

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Turn around, don't whisper out my name
For like a breeze, it would stir a dying flame
I'll miss someone, if it eases you to know
And close the door lightly when you go

// You Never Wanted Me //

Wondering and waiting, my back against the wall
Not a word that passed between us comes to recall
Just your shadow at the window as you pass on down the hall
You never wanted me and never knew me at all

I haven't any picture to set before my eyes
Nothing I can blame when the blues start to rise
Just the memory of laughter and a living out of lies
But if I could change my ways we would never have said goodbye

If you ever get the time, please think of me
It's a lock that can't be broken and there isn't any key
I'm only in your mind, only you can set me free
You can't hurt me anymore and it isn't hard to see

Someday, someone will leave you and I know you'll feel the same
But you'll mark it down to memory and a dream that never came
But there are no answers given when love is just a game
And you never wanted me and now I feel the same

// Marcie //

Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea

Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
He tells her
Wait for me

Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again

// Night In The City //

Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moons up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time

// Gone, Gone, Gone //

Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
Because I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone really gone
Gone, gone, gone, 'cause you done me wrong

Everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
Why you're on your own
Just tell 'em I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, 'cause you done me wrong

If you change your way, baby
You might get me to stay, baby
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone
'Cause I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong

// If It Feels Good, You Know It Can't Be Wrong //

O here we are just you and me
The folks have gone to bed
Cat's put out, the fire's stoked up
And the fish have all been fed
There's no one to disturb us
So put down your coffee mug
Let's get to work, come over here
And join me on the rug

And we can do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can't be wrong

O George you are demanding
And you always get your way
But I really don't feel up to it
I've had a lousy day
The office was exhausting
My boss is such a creep
You know I'd love to, really
But now I need some sleep

So we can do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can't be wrong

O won't you come on Ethel
Where's your sense
Of the gay, abandoned fun
Don't get uptight
The time is right
And the evening's just begun
Well you know the fun that we had last night
You said it was a groove
Let's get to work down here right now
'Cause I'm feeling in the mood

To just do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can't be wrong

O your fingers may be aching
My bones feel that way too
Control yourself a little
And slow down you wild one you
My father wouldn't like me to
So I'm showing you the door
I'll see you George tomorrow
And we'll limbo dance some more

Do that thing, do that thing, do it all night long
If you feel good, you know it can't be wrong
If you feel good, you know it can't be wrong

// I Still Miss Someone //

At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

// Bird On A Wire //

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way
To be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons
For thee

If I have been unkind
I hope you will just let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was not unto you

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with its horns
I have torn everyone
Who reached out for me

And I swear by this song
And by all I have done wrong
That I will make it all
Up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden cross
He said to me "do not ask for so much"
And a woman standing in her darkened door
She cried to me "hey, why not ask for more?"

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way
To be free

// Tried So Hard //

Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
'Cause she's moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities
It's not the first break I've had
Just can't let it bring me down too low
'Cause I tried so hard to please her
There must be something more to know

Never thought that we would find our end this way
It seemed that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine

So I'll stop again and look right past the pain
Because I've been in love before and I can love again
While she's moving somewhere far away not slow
Although I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
'Cause she's moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

// Shattering Live Experience //

Evening's dawning, missed the morning
Slept the afternoon
Half the day's gone, still I laze on
Got no silver spoon

But there's someone out there somewhere
Some girl with my other side
She won't know me, but she'll show me
How to treat another heart

Life is bedlam if you let them
Kick and put you down
They will race you, beat, disgrace you
Push your face into the ground

But you can get out of there somehow
She will show you how it's done
She's no lady, but she made me
Feel that I need a crown

I'll repay her and convey her
My realities
She'll respond with, condescend with
Trivialities

For she doesn't have to think of
For too long to read my mind
She's a winner, no beginner
She's a friend of mine
