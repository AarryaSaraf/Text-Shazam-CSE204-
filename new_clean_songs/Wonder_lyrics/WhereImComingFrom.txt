Album: WhereImComingFrom

// Look Around //

We are idle strangers
Married to our dangers
Into space we go to change our ways

Flying to our heavens
We are all together
Into hell we chase the light of day

Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll see
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind

We are charmed by living
Dazzled into giving
All the waste we plan to ignore

Coldness is the virtue
Measured by the untrue
Love is used for something but what for?

Look around and you'll see
Ruins of the human history
Look around and you'll see
Time is only floating in your mind
You will find
Searching for time
Empty is your mind
Look around

// Do Yourself A Favour //

Isolated junk yard
Letting out the garbage
Eating through the core of life 

Sweet fragrance irritates
In a state room death awaits
Persecute your own self-pride 

Suffocate the new high
Ride the thorny mule that cries
"Dig your grave and step right in" 

Like a judas pay the price
30 pieces for a ride
Here's the fire take a chew 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Shredded know-how give away
Species of the human race
Those funky winds of ups and downs 

Hall of grit is known too well
Heaven still is your hell
Poison slowly slowly drowns 

Let the devil step right in
Lucifer's your only friend
Ain't a soul go'n pity you 

Hurdly over time to death
With open arms it waits I bet
Don't you wish you could reach ground? 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time 

Do yourself a favour
Educate your mind
Get yourself together
Hey there ain't much time

// Think Of Me As Your Soldier //

Think of me as your soldier
The man whose life is for you
And the sweet love
That's greater than time has known

Think of me as your soldier
Through worlds of hate I'm for you
Tho' the darkness hits me ever hard
I'll stand long

And we'll be lovers seeing love by heaven's light
Lovers dreaming dreams each blessed by night
I will find the promised paradise
With you there I'll spend my life

In our hearts there are no others
We are bound as two lovers
To give the great eternal love

And we'll be lovers seeing love by heaven's light
Lovers dreaming dreams each blessed by night
I will find the promised paradise
With you there I'll spend my life
I'll spend my life

Think of me, girl, as your soldier
Through worlds of pain I'm for you
To give an endless love
To give an endless love
To give an endless love
To you....

// If You Really Love Me //

And if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around 

You call my name
Oooh so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you 

But if you really love me won't you tell me..
But if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around 

I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby
It's time to go...
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say 

Oh if you really love me won't you tell me..
Oh if you really love me won't you tell me..
And if you really love me won't you tell me..
Then I won't have to be 
Playing around no
Playing around no
Hey yeah
Goofin' around no
Oh baby
Playing around no
Let me know how you feel baby
Hey oh baby
Playing around no

// Something Out Of The Blue //

I opened my mind
Peace I could not find
Then something out of the blue
Said I needed you

Time swept me away
Merged me into pain
Then something out of the blue
Said you need me too

Oh what joy it brings to me
To know that heaven's wrong
Oh what gladness in my heart
To know my love's been found

Chains totalled my climb
I  was pushed out of time
Then something out of the blue
Said you'd see me through

Something out of the blue
Said you'd see me through

Now where hope was lost
Love's paid the cost
And something out of the blue
Said my love is you

Something out of the blue
Said I needed you

Something out of the blue

// I Wanna Talk To You //

M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m

Wid Big grey hungry eyes

When I gain the biggest mouth

// Take Up A Course In Happiness //

When life reaches out and takes you
On an unpleasent ride
And your bridge of dreams comes
Tumblin' down
Don't let your bed of sorrow
Ever conquer your pride
Remember there's always a way out

Just take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile

And when your optimism
Has a set back or two
And you feel all your tryin's in vain
(Your heart's in the rain)
Don't give up the hope that's due you
Just to study your doubt
Remember there's always a way out

Just take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile

[Repeat three times]

// I Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer //

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

You said there would be warm love in springtime
That was when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

Why didn't you stay?

// Sunshine In Their Eyes //

A lonesome fear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all
Oh I can't wait until there's sunshine in their eyes

You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
You feel that they're too young
To take a look around
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around

Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

He can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sunshine
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
Sunshine in our eyes

Oh my momma's worried cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa's stayin real careful cause his brother Sam was robbed
Trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John

See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Cost of livin's up, but the pay is low and down
Hate to see the babies starve cause momma cant be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains the door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way

See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Father Bills gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame bolding pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
yeah yeah yeah
la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
