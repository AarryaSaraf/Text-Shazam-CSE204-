// Maybe Your Baby //

I'm feelin' down and some kind of lonely, 
Cause' my baby done left me here, 
Heart's blazing like a five alarm fire 
And I don't even give a care 

I feel like the world is turnin' on me, 
My dreams turnin' to ashes right in front of my face, 
And I'm gettin' kind of worried, 
And I feel so out of place, 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

[Background] . . I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh 
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 

In the mornin' when I've got heartache, 
I can't call up the doctor for help, 
Cause' the only person that could ever do me any good, 
Is steppin' out with my best friend 

I feel like I'm slippin' deeper, 
Slippin' deeper into myself, 
And I can't take it, 
This stuff is scarin' me to death 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Kinda makin' me worried, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer, 
Checkin' out the guys that are passing by 

[Background]...by, by, by, by... 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans 

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Not includin' future plans, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe my baby done made some other plans, 
Maybe my baby done made another plan 
with another man. 
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby, 
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby, 
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

// You And I (We Can Conquer The World) //

Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you

Will it stay the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side
To see me through
Until my life is through

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I

// Tuesday Heartbreak //

Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair, 
Cause you say that you found another man, 
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care, 
Cause you found you another man 

I want to be with you when you're all alone, 
I want to be with you 
when you feel you got another man, 
You see, baby, it's all alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes, 
I wanna stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you 

Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag, 
When you know that you love her especially, 
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams, 
Maybe than I can see you all the time 

But I wanna be with you when the nightime comes 
I wanna be with you when the daytime comes, 
I wanna stay and never go away, 
Oh baby, it's alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna stay with you till the morning runs, 
I wanna, baby, baby, baby, it's alright 

I wanna be with you when the nightime comes, 
I wanna be with you till the daytime comes 
Oh baby, get away, alright

// You've Got It Bad Girl //

When you believe in a feeling, 
And it's holding you back from my love, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

When you insist on excluding 
The tenderness that's in my kiss, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

If you try to display an emotion, 
That will contradict itself, 
You will find your heart just sitting 
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf 

Should you depend on an outlet, 
Through which an escape can be found, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

If you don't see there's no way out, 
Just no way of getting around me, 
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

Yes, you know the plans I am making, 
Are intended to capture you, 
So you practice false reactions, 
To delay the things I do, the things I do, 
things I do, foolish you 
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad 

There's no reward in detouring 
My deep sincerity. 
Especially since what you're feeling, 
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me 

Before you discover the feeling, 
You've tried very hard to hide, 
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl 

But when you can find just a small space, 
To let my love live in your mind, 
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll 
have it good girl

// Big Brother //

Your name is big brother 
You say that you're watching me on the tele, 
Seeing me go nowhere, 
Your name is big brother, 
You say that you're tired of me protesting, 
Children dying everyday, 
My name is nobody 
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door 

Your name is big brother 
You say that you got me all in your notebook, 
Writing it down everyday, 
Your name is I'll see ya, 
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres, 
The President of your soul 
I live in the ghetto, 
You just come to visit me 'round election time 

I live in the ghetto, 
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side, 
My name is secluded, 
we live in a house the size of a matchbox, 
Roaches live with us wall to wall, 

You've killed all our leaders, 
I don't even have to do nothin' to you 
You'll cause your own country to fall

// Blame It On The Sun //

Where has my love gone? 
How can I go on? 
It seems dear love has gone away 

Where is my spirit? 
I'm nowhere near it, 
Oh yes, my love has gone astray 

But I'll blame it on the sun, 
The sun that didn't shine, 
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees 

I'll blame it on the time that never was enough, 
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea, 
But, my heart blames it on me 

Who poured the love out? 
What made this bitter doubt? 
Is peace not here for me to see? 

Wish I could tell you, 
What I am feeling, 
But, words won't come for me to speak 

But I'll blame it on the sun, 
That didn't fill the sky, 
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees 

I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon, 
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be, 
But, my heart blames it on me 

[Background]...Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh, 
Your heart blames it on you this time

// Lookin' For Another Pure Love //

Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind, 
I had no problems, never a problem in my life, 
Never a worry on my mind 

All my days before today were happy, 
And secure until your phone call, 
You were tellin' me goodbye 

Now I'm lookin' for another love, 
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life 
And I'm lookin' for another love, 
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life 

Now the wheel of fate has turned, 
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered, 
He is a problem in my life, 
I have a problem on my mind 

Things you cherish most in your life, 
Can be taken if they're left neglected, 
Leavin' a problem in your life 

'Cause now I'm lookin' for another love, 
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh, 
And now I'm lookin' for another love, 
And now I'm lookin' for another love, 
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh, 
I'm lookin' for another love, 
I'm lookin for another pure love in my life

// I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever) //

Shattered dreams, worthless years, 
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell, 
Life began, then was done, 
Now I stare into a cold and empty well 

The many sounds that meet our ears 
the sights our eyes behold, 
Will open up our merging hearts, 
And feed our empty souls 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

Without despair we will share, 
And the joys of caring will not be replaced, 
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm, 
They won't be hard to find, 
And the words of love I speak to you 
will echo in your mind 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever, 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 

I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again, 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 

God surely answered my prayer, 
God surely answered by prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
You know God surely answered my prayer, 
God always will answer your prayers, 
Believe in one who will answer my prayer, 
Thank you God 

Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the woman I've been waiting for, 
Come on, let's fall in love, 
You're the girl that I really adore, 
Come on, let's fall in love...[etc]
