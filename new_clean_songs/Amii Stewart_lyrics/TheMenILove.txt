// The Long And Winding Road //

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Leads me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here
Many years ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to you door

But still they lead me back
To winding road, oh winding road
You left me standing here
Many years ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to you door

// Every Breath You Take //

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep calling baby, baby please...

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

// I Just Wanna Stop //

For your love, for your love
When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights

Ooh, I tried so hard to take it
But I know my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you babe
I just gotta stop
For your love

For your love, for your love
When I think about the way the world must turn
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me
Memories of life and times go on and on
Ooh, I've tried hard to forget it
But I know my mind won't let it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I just wanna stop
For your love
Ooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But I know my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I just wanna stop
For your love
