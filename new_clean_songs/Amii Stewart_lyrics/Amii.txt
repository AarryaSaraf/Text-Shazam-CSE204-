// Time Is Tight //

Down the open highway
Time just fades away
Colours paint the sky
As all friends fade to gray
No one sees the hours
They just count the years
When the thunder fills the sky
There'll be no tears

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Down the open highway
Time just fades away
Colours paint the sky
As all friends fade to gray
No one sees the hours
They just count the years
When the thunder fills the sky
There'll be no tears

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight!

// Power Play //

Wake up to the sound of music
Tune it to my head
Tender darlin' found the coolest groove
I hit the streets to the ghetto beat
Baby, check out on my moods
Hypnotize you with my dancing' shoes

Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command
Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command

Power play, power play
Power play, power play
Power play, power play, power play
Power play

When the world goes stuck in heavy
You won't see me cry
'Cause I've got my music
Jumpin' by my side
You can beat it, you can cheat it
But you won't see me the blues
The air is always got me satisfied

Cause Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command
Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command

Power play, power play
Power play, power play
Power play, power play, power play
Power play...

// Easy On Your Love //

I love you like my life
But you always kiss the knife
I don't know why I stay
Your sayin' "Don't know why"
Always make me cry
Such a price to pay
It's easy to say knowin' you tie and go
It's easy just to cash in
You see me and I know that I'm still alone
No tellin' when we're gonna win

Take it easy on your love
Try to take it easy on your love
Easy on your love
Easily so easy to know
Are you ever gonna go?
Easy on your love

I love you all the way
Did I have to say
That all the passion was yesterday
The night is always like
When you turn on the lights
Shadows come out to play
It's easy just to hide all your alibis
It's easy just to cash in
Don't leave me on the time
And it's yours and mine
No tellin' when we're gonna win

Take it easy on your love
Try to take it easy on your love
Easy on your love
Easily so easy to know
Are we ever gonna go?
Easy on your love...

// Love's In Disguise //

Something doesn't sign
There's a love is tryin' to hide
In between the vision and the dream
Feel my achin' heart, feel my wonder desires
These sensations play up on my skin
Love's in disguise, love's in disguise

Look into my eyes deeper than the diamond lights
Can't you see this love inside
Over love you meet, over dreams you see
All my love's between the lines
Love's in disguise

Oh, is it hard to recognize?
Oh, can't you see love's in disguise?

Walk to side on my cage, I'm lifted on the stage
Satisfaction guarantee
Love's a masquerade, love's a cool charade
Come on baby feed my needs
Love's in disguise, love's in disguise

Oh, is it hard to recognize?
Oh, can't you see love's in disguise?

Look into my eyes deeper than the diamond lights
Can't you see this love inside
Over love you meet, over dreams you see
All my love's between the lines
Love's in disguise...

// Lover To Lover //

Got a feelin' bein' born later
There's somethin' wrong, and I don't know what
I don't see the passion I used to see
Broken promises hangin' in the air
You don't care like you used to care
Before when you're lyin' here by me

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm just goin' crazy
But cryin' lonely
I've got to know I'm the one you need
I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies

You belong to the cost of love
Imagination that won't give up
I give feeling, it's more than that you were bored
You never lie, you just leave up the truth
But one kiss cannot hide the proof
That's when you dream of the one you're dreamin' of

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm just goin' crazy
But cryin' lonely
I've got to know I'm the one you need
I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies
One way or another
Holdin' on tight in the dark

You can use so many words to confuse me
But you'd better be ready to lose me
Forget the past that you play so well
A touch can tell lover to lover tonight

I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
One way or another
Holdin' on tight in the dark
Lover to lover
Come on and tell me, tell me
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies...

// Break These Chains //

In the darkness over night
In searches of love's delight
I'm talkin' with him for awhile
That's all around me
I can move it, I can spread
I'm hopeless and so weak
I'm searchin' somewhere, someone will find me

(Break, break these chains)
(Break, break these chains)

I need a place where I belong
Someone to call my own
Livin' with him without past form behind me
I give my body, mind and soul
No wishin' trendin' under control
To the wonder cut these ropes that now wind me

Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love
Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love

(Break these chains) Break these chains
(Break these chains)

Like a ship without a sail
No direction that's all frail
I'm searchin' for someone to guide me
No more longin' lonely nights
No solitary bights
No more with you're forever beside me

Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love
Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love

(Break these chains) Break these chains
(Break these chains)...

// Love Ain't No Toy //

Love ain't no toy, hey

Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it
Hmmm... Can you dig it, babe

How this is the whole make concern
This rap about to lay on you
Is about takin' my heart and money
And mess with my emotions
Now this can be very very dangerous
Now I don't know what you're bein' involved with
Talkin' 'bout my man
But this will kill you
Freaker than anything like drug stuff
Can you dig it

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

It ain't no toy, it ain't no toy
Love ain't no toy

I've been mounted, mounted, good to you
It's another way fact of toy
Even everything that you ask me to
Ain't it true
Still you when since you don't treat me bad
But you're gonna fool 'round and lose
The best things you ever had
Let me hear now

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Don't mean no faintly
When you come from
You know I can give, you gotta give it
Can you dig it
I don't know what your friends call ya
When you're out on the streets
Warn me you're passin' over
To me, your way nothin' but a lowdown
So just ride and good rings
And I ain't kickin' none, none, none, none, none
'Cause you ain't never gonna change
And I ain't never gonna stop complainin'
One thing, I wanna say to you
Never wouldn't, I'm sayin' to you

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

Let me hear, let me hear
Gotta say you dig it
I wanna know, I wanna know now

Gotta give it, gotta give it
Gotta give it to me
Gotta give it, gotta give it
Gotta give it to me
Let me tell you 'bout

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy...

// The Mystery Of Love //

A storm of passion in the night
I must be high on love
A touch of magic you delight
I must be high on love
My world's dreams are comin' true
I must be high on you
This is the night for me and you
So tell me all 'bout

(The mystery of love)
In the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answers in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Ooh, won't you teach me in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Tell me you're all 'bout the mystery of love

I hope this night will never end
I must be high on love
Against your touch, there's no defence
I must be high on love
You are my fate, you are my rescue
I must be high on you
This is the night for me and you
So tell me all 'bout

(The mystery of love)
In the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answers in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Ooh, won't you teach me in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Tell me you're all 'bout the mystery of love

(The mystery of love) In the middle of the night
(The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answer in the middle of the night
(The mystery of love) Teach me, teach me
(The mystery of love) Tell me all 'bout the mystery of love...

// Conspiracy //

Beside you on the street last Saturday night
And my heart lived out of time
I said to myself right then and there
"Boy, I'm gonna make you mine"
Tired to get a whole of your telephone number
Tired to get your home address
Asked everybody in the neighborhood
But the game was out of success

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

Nothin' in the world could stop me now
I'll use every trick in the book
I'll think of a skin of master playin'
Just to get you in the hook
I'll be sweet mood, tenderly taffy
And the thing that I can find
And the physical seduction doesn't work
I'll do shoot with my mind

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

It seems like rendez-vous
I wanna spend my night with you
It seems like rendez-vous
Nobody does but we're gonna do
It seems like rendez-vous
I wanna spend my night with you
It seems like rendez-vous
Nobody does but we're gonna do (nobody does but we're gonna do)

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

// This Generation //

Awful century is not his problem
But he can try, other say it
Mothers and fathers, they built this country
We must've put them sub to share

But nowadays we're talking 'bout distraction
We've got to stand up
And make everybody say it
Nowadays we're talkin' 'bout pollution
We've got to stand up
And set this world free

This generation won't change the works right
This generation, we hold up to fight
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
(This generation)
This generation will find solution
This generation will be in confusion
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
We're singin'
Nanana di da...

When you look 'round you see
We've got problems
But we can try, other say it
What you get, it's all that
We can rule this country
We must've put them sub to share

But nowadays we're talking' 'bout distraction
We've got to stand up
And make everybody say it
Nowadays we're talkin' 'bout pollution
We've got to stand up
And set this world free

This generation won't change the works right
This generation, we hold up to fight
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
(This generation)
This generation will find solution
This generation will be in confusion
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
We're singin'
Nanana di da...

Stand up, stand up
Oh, stand up, stand up
Oh, stand up
