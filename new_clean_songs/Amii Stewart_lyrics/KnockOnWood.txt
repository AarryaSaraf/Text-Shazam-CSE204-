// Knock On Wood //

I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh

Yes, I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
I got me spinnin', baby
You know that I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh

(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock)

Ooh, baby, ooh

It's no secret about it
'Cause with his loving touch
He sees to it that I get enough
Feel his touch all over
You know it means so much

It's like thunder, burstin' lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh

(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)

// You Really Touched My Heart //

I wandered down to your place
It won't be the same
Face to face, I look at you
But you turned away

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew that love could go so far (so capture the moments)
So capture the moments
Before it's all over with you

I'll walk away but it's hard
When you poke at me to stay
You can call out my name
But our love will never, never be the same

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew that love could go so far
Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
So capture the moments (capture the moments)
Before it's all over with you

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you know you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew-ooh-ooh
That love could go so far

(Capture the moments)
So capture the moments
Before it's all over (it's all over)
So capture the moments (it's all over)
Before it's all over

You, you know you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew, never knew, never knew
That love could go so far
You, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
So capture the moments (capture the moments)
Before it's all over with you

// Light My Fire / 137 Disco Heaven //

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for hesitation's through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now 'cause we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
Disco, disco heaven

// Bring It On Back To Me //

I sit here on my own
Temptation is to fool
But I know that if I do
It'll come too

I found a compromise
No hang ups and no ties
But I'm only hiding
Behind laughter as disguise

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Yeah

Your love left out and feels
As I hung on through the years
But who was I fooling
When I cried, "No more tears"

I found a compromise
No hang ups and no ties
But I'm only hiding
Behind laughter as disguise

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
I want you just to bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Won't you just bring it on back to me
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me, yeah

// Closest Thing To Heaven //

Do you ever need someone to hold at night?
Did music ever fill your soul?
My spinning mind just knows that's right
Did you ever dream of lovin' at first sight?

You are the closest thing to heaven I know
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one else could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

And wiser men in love have walked away
But are you strong enough to stay?
A fool in love will walk his way
Could we ever stop to think for just today?

You are the closest thing to heaven I know
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one else could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

Put your head on my shoulder
Let me feel your emotions
You know you're the one I love (you're the one I love)
Clouds disappear, the sun's gettin' near
You're the only one I'm thinking of

You are the closest thing
The closest thing to heaven
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one, no one could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

The closest thing to heaven
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one, no one could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

// Am I Losing You //

Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?

I saw you yesterday
You're up with someone new
The things people say
Oh, tell me they're not true
Is she just a friend?
Or is this the end?
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?

It hurts to realize
I'm not the only one
Are you telling lies?
Am I a figure of fun?
I still got my pride
The tears I must hide
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Everybody thought we were good for each other
So did I
Until I saw you with her
And I would do anything for you
Except share

Is she just a friend?
Or is this the end?
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Hoo-haa
Am I, am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
Am I, am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
I still got my pride
Hoo-haa
Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?
Hoo-haa

// Get Your Love Back //

I know I was wrong
For leaving you by yourself
I said something's got a hold on me
And I lost control

But now I know where I belong (where I belong)
And I wanna come back home (wanna come back home)
I need your love
And, baby, I need it so bad

Here I stand with my heart in my hands (with my heart in my hands)
Don't make me feel any less than I am (any less than I am)
Don't make me crawl on my hands
Back to you

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back

I know you wanna make me pay
For all the wrong that I've done
Well, baby, I'm ready (I'm ready)
I will pay you the price that you want

And I don't care what I have to do (what I have to do)
As long as I can be close to you (be close to you)
Your sweet love was the best love
That I ever had

Here I stand with the tears in my eyes (with the tears in my eyes)
I'm not ashamed to let you see me cry (let you see me cry)
To be without your love, I'd rather die
Baby, please hold me in your arms

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back
I'll be so satisfied

Now I know where I belong (where I belong)
And I wanna come back home (wanna come back home)
I need your love
And, baby, I need it so bad

Here I stand with my heart in my hands (with my heart in my hands)
Don't make me feel any less than I am (any less than I am)
Don't make me crawl on my hands
Back to you, oh baby

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back, oh baby

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back
Get it back, get it back, get it back, get it back, get it back

If I could only, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby

If I could only, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
If I could only, yeah, yeah
Baby

// Only A Child In Your Eyes //

I was only a child in your eyes
Just a girl for all seasons
With no deeper reasons
You were always the man in my eyes
I loved you until the magic flew away
Why should you think I'd always stay?
Why was I only a child in your eyes?

I was only a child in your eyes
How I wish that you'd made me
Feel like a lady
You were always the man in my eyes
I loved you, why did you let me slip away? (why did you let me slip away?)
And now you beg for me to stay
Could I be more than a child in your eyes?

Looked up to you, idolized
Now I see right through you
Realized I was a fool

Until the magic flew away (until the magic flew away)
Why should you think I'd always stay?
Until the magic flew away (magic, magic)
Why was I only a child in your eyes?
