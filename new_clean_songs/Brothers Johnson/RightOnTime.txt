// Runnin' For Your Lovin' //

Since we've part, our lives become a new
Searching life's long fantasies are through
Giving all we've got to give wouldn't do

You try so hard, I'll get into the mood
Now it's time to kiss and say farewell
Before I go there's something I should tell

I'll be
Runnin' for your lovin'
When you need someone
Runnin' for your lovin'
[Unverified] I got some

Runnin' for your lovin'
Let me kiss ya' 'cause I miss ya'
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do

Runnin' for your lovin'
If you need some affection
Runnin' for your lovin'
Point me in the right direction

Runnin' for your lovin'
Say you'll let me love you
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do

Now you see another side of me
Wanting to still love you, can't you see?
Will you love me, kiss me, hug me, tell
Chances are we'll find each other well

I'll come running
Runnn' for your lovin'
For you lovin'

I'll come
Runnn' for you lovin'
For your love

Runnin'
I'll hunt you very far
Just to be right where your are
You know I'm runnnin' for your love
For you lovin'

Runnin'
To be close to you, you know it's true
That I'll squeeze you girl and love you too
For you lovin'
I'm gonna get ya'

Runnin'
I'll showed [unverified]
Your love is so sweet, it won't change
For you lovin'

Runnin'
Runnin' here
Runnin' there
Runnin' everywhere, I swear
For you lovin'

Runnin'
Yow
For you lovin'

For you lovin'
I'll hunt you very far
Just to be right where your are
You know I'll, I'll get ya'
For you lovin'

Runnin'
To be close to you you know its true
That I'll squeeze you girl, and love you too
I'm gonna get ya'
For you lovin'

Runnin'

Your love is so sweet, it won't change

Runnin'
I'll run all over the world for you
Got to get your love
Got to get your sweet, sweet love
For you lovin'

Got to get your love
Got to get your love

// Free Yourself, Be Yourself //

Your state of mind
Is not the way you should feel all the time
My point of view of you
You should leave all your troubles behind

Sitting alone
Don't know how much longer this can go on
Until you find peace
You've got to stand straight up on your two feet

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Some things you do
You know you try, but it just won't come through
Then you wind up, alone
In your room with a new shade of blue

It's not the way
That you should spend the better part of your day
Wasting away
With nothing left but to face a new day

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Get on up, Girl
You can do it
Live your life, Girl
You can do it
Come on, Baby
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

// Right On Time //

Well, well, yeah
Right on time, right on time

Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, in a minute
Right on time, right on time

Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time, in a minute
In a minute

In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Now when you're dancin' to the music
Just let yourself go and move right into it
Don't be bashful, don't be ashamed
Because there's somebody, just wanna know your name
Everybody do it, let me see you move it

In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Now go on and get down and party, party
Don't you wanna party, party
Let me see ya party, party
Feelin' like a party, party

Everybody do it, let me see you move it

In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Watch out, y'all, we said the funk was comin'

Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time

We said the funk was comin'
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time

We said the funk was comin'
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time
Let me see ya get down...

// Strawberry Letter 23 //

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins, dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask or is it cool, is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

// Never Leave You Lonely //

My love, my only
You can't imagine how you make me feel inside
For you have opened all doors
To you my heart can't hide
Oh, baby, my only
Say you love me and you'll never leave me lonely

I'll never leave you lonely, girl
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

My love, my only
I know the two of us were hurt by love before
But now, girl, we're together
Let's love each other more
Oh, baby, my only
Say you love me and I'll never leave you lonely

I'll never leave you lonely, girl
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

Alright, okay
I'll never leave you lonely
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

I'll never leave you lonely
I'll never leave you lonely

Oh, Lord
I'll never leave you lonely
Okay
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

Funk on, funk on
Alright, alright
I'll never leave you lonely
Okay
I'll never leave you lonely...

// Love Is //

I love you, all in all
'Cause love is just my way
To say I need you every day

Your love is, after all
A special kind of touch
That turns me on so much
I can't help myself

I love you, all in all
'Cause you've been good to me
And every day, girl, we get closer

Love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

I love you, all in all
'Cause love is just my way
To say I need you every day

I love you, all in all
'Cause I have never known a love
That I could really call my own

Say love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

Love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is...
