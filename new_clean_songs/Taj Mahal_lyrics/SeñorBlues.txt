// Think //

Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
I'm the one that loves you

Think about the sacrifices that I made for you
Think about the hard times that you put me through
Think about the good things that I done for you
Think about the bad things I tried not to do

Come on cheer me
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

Lady, before you leave me you'll realize
That I'm the one that loves you

Come on cheer me now
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
That I'm the one that loves you

How much of the happiness can you really claim?
How many tears have you shed, for what you're to blame?
Though I can't remember just what went wrong
I tried so hard to please you, at least that's what I thought

Come on cheer me now
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
I, I'm the one that loves you

Lady before you leave me you'll realize
That I, I'm the one that loves you

// Irresistible You //

Your magic hands
Your lovin' eyes
Your kissable lips
Makes my heart realize
I'm in love, I'm in love
And you know it's true
Tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

I don't know what you got
But it's got me and I'm hooked
Like a fish in the sea
You make eagles call from above
Make the Devil fall in love
Who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

Oh, come on
Lets dance awhile
I wanna talk...
To you child...
You been blessed...
So much, too much...
There is a wonder of love in your touch

Don't ever fret
Don't you worry about me, I never regret
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
Tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

Don't you ever fret
Don't you worry about me I never regret
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
But tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

// Having A Real Bad Day //

I found her number, and the note she wrote
Deep in the pocket, of a real old coat
It just got by me some way

I'm having a real bad day
Said she was all moved in and her apartment, sure looked fine
Suggested I come by, and see her some time

Said all her fixtures were new, and I'll turn them on for you
She said I get home at a quarter to six
I'll be waiting for your call
I'll fix you something, I'm sure your gonna love

But we don't have to, we don't have to eat at all
That's one of the problems, of life on the road
Little notes like this ain't got no area code
I don't know what else to say

I'm having, a real bad day
I don't know what to say
I'm having, a real bad day

// Señor Blues //

Senor Blues is what they call him
Way down Mexicali way
Senoritas fallin' for him
With the hope that he will stay
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away

Well, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
Yes, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away

Senor Blues is what they call him
Way down Mexicali way
Senoritas fallin' for him
With the hope that he will stay
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away

Well, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
Yes, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away

// I Miss You Baby //

I have missed you, baby
And my patience is running out
Yeah, I have missed you, baby
And my patience is running out
If you come back home, baby
I will be so happy that I could shout

When you left you took my love
And you even broke my heart
Yes, when you left you took my love
And you even broke my heart
If you come back to me, baby
We could make a brand new start

And I've loved you everyday
Even let you have your way
Won't you [?]
Even if you are my baby
I am so lonely, baby
So lonely I could die
If you never miss me, darling, until I say goodbye

// You Rascal You //

Now I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, uh huh
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah
Well, I let into my home, you gonna leave my woman alone
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you
Now I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you, uh huh
I'll be glad, oh I'll be tickled to death
When you leave this earth it's true, oh yeah
When you're lyin' down six feet deep, no more fried chicken will you eat
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah

Ah, you just ain't no good
Oh, you dog, now listen here

I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, uh huh
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah
I'll be standin' on the corner high, when they drag your body by
I'll be glad when you're dead, you know I'm gonna be so happy
When you're gone you dog
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you

// Mind Your Own Business //

If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's alright
'Cause me and that pretty woman got a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

Oh, the woman on the party line is such a nosy thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

I got a pretty little girl who wears her skirts up high
The boys all whistle when she walks by
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be worryin' about mine

If I wanna honky-tonk around to two or three
Now, brother, that's my headache, don't you worry about me
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be worryin' about mine

Mindin' other people's business might seems to be high-toned
Got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

Yes, if you mind your own business
Then you'll sleep easy all the time

// 21st Century Gypsy Singing Lover Man //

I know it's hard to love a gypsy
Please, don't worry, baby
'Cause I'll soon be coming home to you

And if I steal away
Steal away like a thief in the night
It's only 'cause I hate to say that long goodbye to you

I know there ain't nowhere
Nowhere can compare
With the comfort of your big brass bed
But I've got a long road to travel
And only a hard and stony ground
For me to rest my weary head

I'm like a fish out of water
Feel like I'm drowning on dry land
If I ain't got a reservation ticket
Right here in the palm of my hand

I'm a 21st century gypsy
21st century gypsy singin' lover man

And when I kiss you goodnight
In the dark hours of the morning
And pack a guitar bag
And head on out the door
I know that you know that I really hate to leave you

But it's that time again and I simply got to go
And if I'm away on the road for weeks on end
In some way off and far flung foreign land
Sailing an ocean or deep down in the jungle
Or in a caravan crossing the burning desert land

I follow a spirit that's been roaming free
Way way back since time began
I was a wandering minstrel in a previous life
Now I'm your 21st century
21st century gypsy singin' lover man

I'm like a fish out of water
I'm drowning on dry land
If I ain't got a reservation ticket
Right here in the palm of my hand

I'm your 21st century gypsy singin' lover man

// At Last (I Found A Love) //

Whoo
At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me

Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing in with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me

At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Ooh, you believe me, at last
Oh, I found a love for me

(One more thing)
I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine
Would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

Aah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Yeah, at last
I found a love for me
Yeah

Whoo...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
She's sweet, so sweet
And she the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oww, yeah, yeah
A love me

Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

At last
Oh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, yeah
I found a love for me
