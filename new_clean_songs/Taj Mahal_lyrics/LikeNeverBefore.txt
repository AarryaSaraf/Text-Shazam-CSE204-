Album: LikeNeverBefore

// Take A Giant Step //

Though you failed at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will mend your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time its time its time you felt like that again

There is just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again and love at last
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind

You stare at me with disbelief
You say for you there's no relief
But girl I swear it won't do you no harm
Don't sit there in your lonely room
Just looking back inside that gloom
Mama that's not were you belong
Come with me I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And everyday everyday hold on woman just got to be seen
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind

Though you failed at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will mend your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time its time its time you felt like that again

There is just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again and love at last
Come with me leave your yesterday your yesterday behind
And take a giant step outside your mind

// Cakewalk Into Town //

I had the blues, so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
Now, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk in the town

I woke up this mornin' feelin' so good
You know, I lay back down again
Throw your big leg over me, mama
I might not feel this good again

My baby, oh, my baby
I love the way she walk
When the girl gets sleepy
I love the way she baby talk

My work don't got scarce, honey
Oh [?] it no got hard
I spend my whole day stealin' chickens
Mama, from the rich folks yard

I got the blues so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
You know, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk into town

I want to go on a picnic
In the country mama oh, and stay all day
I don't care but don't do nothing
Just while my time away

I got the blues, so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
You know, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk into town

// Don't Call Us //

Ridin' in on your big horse you look me up and down
Starin' at me like I'm some kind of stranger in your town
And I was down and out needin' a friend
And you're one, you help me put my life back together again

Don't call us, oh we'll call you, I heard
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Ooh oh, well we'll call you

I heard you fell from grace, tumbled from your throne
How does it feel now to be left all alone?
The tables have turned, it's sad but it's true
Now, you need somebody who will care for you

Oh, you need mamacita, [?] that is true
Oh, you need mamacita, but that is true

Oh, don't call us, oh we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
I said, don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
Then we'll get in touch with you

Those same people you meet on the way up
Oh, are the same people you meet on the way down
Now tell me how does it feel
When you find yourself layin' there on the ground, oh yeah
Tell me now

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you
Don't call us, we'll call you

Get in touch with you
Get in touch with you
Get in touch with you

Don't, don't call us
Don't don't, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you
If there's somethin' you need to have done
We'll get in touch with you

Don't call us, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you

// Big Legged Mommas Are Back In Style //

Talkin' 'bout big legged mommas back in style again
I mean, them short fat fannies back in style again
You ain't had no real good love till you been loved by one of them
Size 14, 16, 18, 22, 24 in style again
I mean them big fat cuties back in style again
You ain't had no juicy Lucy until you've been loved by one of them

Well momma and poppa told me, son you better shout
Woman that you got, she is gonna knock you out
Big legged mommas, now, they're back in style again
I mean them big fat cuties, back in style again
You ain't had no real good lovin' till you've been loved by one of them

She gonna rock you, she gonna roll you, she won't try to control you
Talkin' 'bout those big legged mommas, they're back in style again
I mean them thick-thighed heifers, back in style again
You ain't had no juicy Lucy till you've been loved by one of them

She's the kind of woman that drinks her coffee in a great big cup
She's the kind of woman that saves her lovin' up
Talkin' 'bout a big legged momma, they're back in style again
I mean them heart shaped booties, back in style again

You ain't had no real good lovin' till you've been loved by one of them
Well, she will not make you shout, she won't make you beg
But she will shake her hooters like a soft boiled egg
Talkin' about those big legged mommas, they're back in style again
I mean them heart shaped booties, back in style again
You ain't had no juicy Lucy till you've been loved by one of them

She says, "Honey get me some WD-40 and oil my spring
My back is made of whale bone and I'm gonna make you sing"
Talkin' about those big legged mommas, they're back in style again
Talkin' about those big legged mommas, they're back in style again
You ain't had no juicy Lucy till you've been loved by one of them
