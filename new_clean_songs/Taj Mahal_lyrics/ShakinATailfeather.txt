// Rockin' Robin //

He rocks in the tree-top all a day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song
All the little birds on J-Bird St
Love to hear the robin goin' tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Oh, rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chickadee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flapping them wings sayin' go bird go

Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Oh, rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight

A wordy little raven at the bird's first dance
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
He started goin' steady and bless my soul
He out popped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the tree-top all a day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' the song
All the little birds on J-Bird St
Love to hear the robin goin' tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Rockin' robin (tweet tweet tweet)
Oh, rockin' robin well you really gonna rock tonight

// Willie And The Hand Jive //

I know a cat named Way Out Willie
He's got a cool little chick named Rockin' Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive too

Papa told Willie, you'll ruin my home
You and that hand jive have got to go
Willie said, Papa, don't put me down
They're doin' the hand jive all over town

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Mama, Mama look at Uncle Joe
He's doin' that hand jive with sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, do that hand jive one more time

Well, the doctor and the lawyer and Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way Out Willie gave 'em all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior, and a-that ain't all
You know, the baby got famous in his crib, you see
Doin' that hand jive on TV

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

// Shortnin' Bread //

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

Three little children layin' in the bed
Two were sick and the other 'most dead
Sent for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed those children on shortnin' bread"

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

When those children layin' in the bed
Heard that talk about shortnin' bread
They popped up well and started to sing
Skipping 'round the room doing the pigeon wing

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

Put on the skillet
Put on the lid
Mamma's going to make some shortnin' bread
That's not all she's going to do
Mamma's going to cook us some cocoa too

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

I snuck to the kitchen, picked up the lid
I filled my pockets full of shortnin' bread
I winked at the pretty little girl and said
"Baby, how'd you like some shortnin' bread"

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

Got caught with the skillet
Got caught with the lid
Got caught with my mouth full of shortnin' bread
Six months for the skillet, six months for the lid
Six months in the jail eatin' shortnin' bread

Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread

// Shake A Tail Feather //

Well, I heard about the fella you've been dancing with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby
Or didn't you think I could

Well, I know that the Boogiloo is out of sight
But the Shingaling she's paying tonight
But if that were you and me out there baby
I would have shown you how to do right

Do it ri-ight, ah-hah, do it ri-ight
Do it right... do it right... do it right...

Ahhh-ah, twistin', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby-y
Here we go loop-dee-loop, shake it up baby
Here we go loop-dee-li
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather

Ahhh-ah, twistin', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby
Here we go loop-dee-loop, shake it up baby
Here we go loop-dee-li
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather

Ahhh-ah, come on, come on baby
Come o-on, yeah-eah, come on babe
Alright, do The Twist, do The Fly, oh
Do The Swim, hah-hah-hah, and do The Bird
Woh do The Jerk and do The Monkey
Hey-hey, Watoosie and uh, what about The Fool
Do The Mash Potata, what about the Boogiloo
Or the Boney Moroney, come on and do The Twist

Ahhh-ahhh, twisti-in', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby-y-y
Twisti-in', skake-it, shake-it, shake-it

// Jim Dandy //

Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

I was sitting on a mountain top
30,000 feet to drop
Tied me on a runaway horse
Uh huh, that's right, of course
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

One day, I met a girl named Sue
She was feeling kind of blue
I'm Dandy, the kind of guy
Who can't stand to see a little girl cry
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

I was riding on a submarine
Got a message from my mermaid queen
She was hanging on a fishing line
Mr. Dandy didn't waste no time!
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

Once upon a time, I went to Maine
Got a ticket on a DC plane
Mr. Dandy didn't need no chute
I was high and ready to boot
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

// Little Sally Walker //

Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your weepin' eyes
And put your hand on your hip and let your backbone slip

Oh, shake it to the East
Oh, shake it to the West
Oh, shake it to the very one that you love the best

// Follow The Drinking Gourd //

The riverbank makes a very good road
The dead trees will show you the way
Left foot, peg foot traveling on
Follow the drinking gourd

The river ends between two hills
Follow the drinking gourd
There's another tree on the other side
Follow the drinking gourd

When the great big river meets the little river
Follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is waiting for to carry you to freedom
If you follow the drinking gourd

When the sun comes back and the first quail cries
Follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is waiting for to carry you to freedom
If you follow the drinking gourd
