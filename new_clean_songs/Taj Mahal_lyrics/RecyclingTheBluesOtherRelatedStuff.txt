// Corinna //

Got a bird what a whistle, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing
Without my Corrina, sure don't mean, sure don't mean a natural thing

I learned to love you baby for I call
Honey for I call your name, baby for I call
Honey for I call your name
I wouldn't trade your love for money
Honey you are my warm heart
Baby, you're my warm hearts flame

Have mercy, have mercy, baby you're my hard luck
Mama on my hard luck soul, baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul

Got a rainbow round my shoulder
Shine like silver, baby look like Klondike gold

Got a bird what whistle, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing
Without Corrina, sure don't mean, sure don't mean a natural thing

Corinna, oh Corinna
Corinna, Corrina
Corrina
Corrina
Corinna
Oh Corrina
Corrina
Corrina

// Texas Woman Blues //

Far below the northern lights
Far below the northern lights
Far below the northern lights

Oh, I wish I was in Texas
Movin' on a steady roll
I wish I was in Texas
Movin' on a steady roll
You know I love that fine lookin'
Texas woman to satisfy my soul

You know, my baby is sweet as honey
Sweet from the honey bee
You know, my baby is sweet as honey
Sweet from the honey bee
Ain't nothin' else to sing of in my life
Ooh, she'd be so nice to me

Lord, it ain't no use to worry
Ain't no use to mourn
Lord, ain't no use to worry
Ain't no use to mourn
You know the way I love that woman
I just can't stand to leave alone

Jives on this song

Got love for ten women
But the one woman on my mind
She don't treat me like no stranger
She treat me nice and kind

She don't worry about the neighbors
'Cause they might not like what they see
She could care less about what they sayin'
She's a woman and she's absolutely free

I wish I was down there in Texas
Swingin' on a steady roll
I'd love that San Antonio woman
To satisfy my soul

I'd love that San Antonio woman
To satisfy my soul
[?]
I'd love that fine, fine Texas woman
To satisfy my soul
