// Stagger Lee //

The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark

Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw an eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty four
Said, I'm gonna to the bar
Just to pay that debt I owe

Blew them, six
Stagger Lee, Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, now, nobody move
Then he pulled his forty four

Stagger Lee, cried Billy
Ohh, please don't take my life
I've got three little children
And a very sickly wife

Well, Stagger Lee shot Billy
Ohh, he shot that poor boy so bad
So the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass

Hate that thing on most hands
Stagger Lee, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee

// Fishin' Blues //

Bet your going fishing all of the time
Baby going fishing too
Bet your life, your sweet wife
Will catch more fish than you

Many fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby going fishing too

I went on down to my favorite fishing hole
Baby grabbed me a pole and a line
Throwed my pole on in, caught a nine pound catfish
You know I brought him home for supper time
Proving any fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate

Many fish bites if you've got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby goin' fishin' too

Baby brother 'bout to run me up out of my mind
Saying, "Can I go fishing with you?"
I took him on down to the fishing hole
Now, what do you think that he did do?
Pulled a great big fish out the bottom of the pond
Now he laughed and jumped cause he was real gone

Many fish bites if you've got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby goin' fishin' too

Put him in the pot baby, put him in the pan
Honey, cook him 'til he's nice and brown
Make a batch of buttermilk hoecakes Mama
And you chew them things and you chomp 'em on down
Singing any fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate

Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby going fishing too

Play the blues...

Bet you're going fishing all of the time
Baby going fishing too
Bet your life, your sweet wife
She going to catch more fish than you

Many fish bites if you got good bait
Oh, here's a little tip that I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, mama's going fishing
And the baby going fishing too

// My Creole Belle //

My Creole Belle, I love her well
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle
My Creole Belle, I Love her well
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle

When stars shine, I'll call her mine
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle
My Creole Belle, I love her well
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle

My Creole Belle, I love her well
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle
When stars shine, I'll call her mine
My darlin' baby, my Creole Belle
