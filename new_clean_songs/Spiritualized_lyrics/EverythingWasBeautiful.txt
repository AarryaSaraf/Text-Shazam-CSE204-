Album: EverythingWasBeautiful

// Always Together With You //

"Everything was beautiful."

If you want a radio
I would be a radio for you
If you want an aeroplane
I would be an aeroplane for you
If you got a lonely heart
I would be a lonely heart for you
If you want a rocket ship
I would be a rocket ship for you

If you walk the galaxies
I would walk the galaxies for you
If you'll be my lonely girl
I would be a lonely boy for you
If you want a shooting star
I would be a shooting star for you
If you want another world
I would be another world for you
If you want a universe
I would be a universe for you

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)

If you want a silver moon
I would be a silver moon for you
If you want a unicorn
I would be a unicorn for you
If you want a satellite
I would be a satellite for you
If you want a universe
I would be a universe for you

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)

Just when you thought your life came
In a bag of white
Sucked up a silver tube
Changes your attitude
Stay with your valentine
Catie and Constantine
Just when you thought it right
Mercury's out tonight

Just like a dream come true
Catie's in love with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Just when you thought it right
Catie is out of sight (If you have a lonely heart too)
Just when you thought your life
Came in a bag of white (If you have a lonely heart too)
Sucked up a silver tube
Changes your attitude (If you have a lonely heart too)

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)

// Best Thing You Never Had (The D Song) //

Holly, you don't wake up, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and you're lying straight back
You're going out the way you can
Oh, and your eyes roll back
They roll back to where you been
Oh, and you roll that die, you never get a roll to win

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Holly, you'd best sit down
You're losing the will to go
How did you blow that mind, you never had a mind to blow?
Oh, and you love that life, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and your eyes roll back, you'd best see it the way you can

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Holly, you laid it down
You're losing the will to go
Oh, and you loved that life, you're too proud to let it show
Honey, your eyes rolled back, the best thing you've ever done
Oh, and your wasted time, you best let the water run
Holly, you best sit down, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and your lesson's learned, you take more the more you can

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Honey, you're laid in doubt, you're never getting anything done
Oh, you're wasting time, you best let the water run
Oh, your eyes light up, the best thing you ever knew
Honey, you best sit down, the good times will come to you
Honey, you lived that life, you're never getting out for free
Honey, you walked that walk, you'll never walk back to me

Gonna be a long ride down
Come on, Holly, we'll take it from here

// Let It Bleed (For Iggy) //

I laboured over these words too long
They're nothing to behold
I wanted it to be special for you
But it's just a song
I wanted it to lay close to your heart and say
"Darling, I was wrong"

I wanted it to say something so special and true
I wanted it to cut deeper and darker for you
I wanted it to show wisdom where honesty's due
Open up and bleed

I laboured over this life too long
There's nothing to behold
I wanted it to be better for you
A minute down the road
I wanted it to go straight to your heart and say
"Darling, I was wrong"

I wanted it to say something so special and true
I wanted it to cut deeper and darker for you
I wanted it to show reason where honesty's due
Open up and bleed
Open up and bleed

Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed

Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down...

// Crazy //

I didn't think it could happen again
Love just fell out of the blue
And it keeps on knocking, we can't let it in
I'm falling in love like a fool

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

And I know you can't love me now, not today
All of my thoughts are of you
But I hope in time that we might find a way
Lord knows how time can be cruel

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

Darling, I need you to tell me to stay
Say that you won't let me go
Darling, I want you but there's just no way

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

Darling, I'm sorry, I must make amends
For messing around with you
We've all heard the story, we know how it ends
Darling, I wish it weren't true

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

// The Mainline Song / The Lockdown Song //

Hush, keep your voices down
Everyone is asleep uptown
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices down
Everyone is asleep uptown
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices clear
There's a change in the air 'round here
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go take the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go tell the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices clear
There's a change in the air 'round here
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go take the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go tell the city tonight

Hush

I caught you once
And I'll court you again
I only wanted to be your friend
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city again

// The A Song (Laid In Your Arms) //

These are the words, they're as old as the hills
Cooked on a diet of mushrooms and pills
One man's crime is another man's thrill
And we're gone

Gonna get beat to the beat of your heart
Gonna get wings on your wings for a start
Take it down easy, won't know where you are
And you're gone

And we're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms

Summer is easy, the cotton is high
Mama's good-looking, your papa has died
One man's love is another man's crime
And we're gone

Idiot bastard, son of a gun
Heaven is easy, your living is done
Take it down easy, won't know what you've done
And we're gone

And we're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms

Clock on the wall says it's quarter to four
TV set's on but you've seen it before
One man's crime is another man's cure
And you're gone

Clock on the wall says it's quarter to six
TV set's on but you're sick of the pricks
One man's crime is another man's hit
And we're gone

And we're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms
We're laid in your arms

Your only love is a love of the gods
Living your life with unfortunate sods
One man's even, the other man odd
And you're gone

You're gone with a wave of your hand
Gone with your head in the sand
Gone, you won't understand
Gone, die like a man

// I'm Coming Home Again //

Maybe Faith has lost her faith again
She'd been betting on the race again
Will not see her on her way around, gonna pack that all up and fool around
Then I'm gonna take it up, baby, or leave it
I'm coming home again

I've been there and I've been back again
Gonna dull it with lorazepam
Kind've had it with philosophy, 'cause I'm thinking I am but I'm failing to be
Let it fall, take it quiet, backslide and I'm gone again

Mary Mary got a four leaf flower
Said her mind is like a Babel Tower
Said she timed it to a factor three
And this life is scaring the life out of me
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Said she read it on a railroad sign
Said we're drinking till the well runs dry
Said she had it written out in the stars
Said the whole of her life was a mess and a scar
Gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Mary Mary got a four leaf flower
Said her mind is like a Babel Tower
Said she timed it to a factor three
But you don't need to know what you don't even see
Gotta take it up, baby, or leave it
I'm coming home again

'Fraid Faith has lost her faith again
She'd been betting on the race again
Said her world is spinning round and round
But you can't make it up there for falling down
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Happiness is not a guarantee
'Cause all your problems are looking good to me
Got a dried-up bed of sympathy
And you cannot be bound if you cannot be free
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Gonna count down ten and I'm out
Gonna count down ten and I'm out
Gonna bend that wire and twist and shout
Gonna holler till they let me out
Gonna take it all, baby, or leave it
'Cause I'm coming home again

Hosanna! Head on high
I'm gonna sing it till the day I die
Ain't gonna wait around and sympathise
Gonna push on the gas, till the gas runs dry
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Mary dances on a hurricane
Said the boys in here are all the same
Will not see her on her way around
'Cause she'd rather be preaching with fools around
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
