// Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space //

Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space 

All I want in life's a little bit of love
To take the pain away
Getting strong today
A giant step each day
All I want in life's a little bit of love
To take the pain away
Getting strong today
A giant step each day
I've been told
Only fools rush in
Only fools rush in
But I don't believe
I don't believe
I could still fall in love with you 

I will love you till I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space and drift in time
All the time until I die
We'll float in space, just you and I
And I will love you till I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space and drift in time
All the time until I die
We'll float in space, just you and I 

Baby I love you today
I guess that's what you want
And I don't know where we are all going
Life don't get stranger than this
It is what it is
And I don't know where we are all going 

I will love you till I die
And I will love you all the time
Everything happens today
And we're out here in space
And I don't know where we are all going
Baby I love you today
I guess that's what you want
And I don't know where we are all going

// Come Together //

Little johnny's sad and fucked
first he jumped and then he looked
the tracks of time, those tracks of mine
little johnny's occupied

come on
come together
come on
come together

well little johnny had an ache
that hung around the poor boy's neck
every time that johnny ate
the little fucker fed the ache

come on 
come together
come on 
come together

so little j's a fucked up boy
who dulled the pain but killed the joy
and little j's a fuckin' mess
but when he's offered just says yes

little j is sad and fucked
first he jumped and then he looked
the tracks of time, those tracks of mine
little j is occupied

come on 
come together
come on 
come together
come on
come together
come on
come together

come together ......

// I Think I'm In Love //

Sun so bright that I'm nearly blind
Cool, 'cause I'm wired and I'm out of my mind
Warm as the dope running down my spine
But I don't care 'bout you,
and I got nothin' to do
Free as the water and air that I breathe
Even freer than DMT
Feel the warmth of the sun in me
But I don't care 'bout you,
and I got nothin' to do
Love in the middle of the afternoon
Just me and my spike in my arm and my spoon
Feel the warmth of the sun in the room
But I don't care about you
And I got nothin'

I think I'm in love,
probably just hungry
I think I'm your friend,
probably just lonely
I think you've got me in a spin now,
probably just turnin'
I think I'm a fool for you babe,
probably just yearnin'
I think I can rock and roll,
probably just twistin'
I think I wanna tell the world,
probably ain't listenin'
Come on

I think I can fly,
probably just fallin'
I think I'm the life and soul,
probably just snortin'
I think I can hit the mark,
probably just aimin'
I think my name is on your lips,
probably complainin'
I think I have caught it bad,
probably contagious
I think that I'm a winner, baby
Probably Las Vegas
Come on

I think I'm alive,
probably just breathin'
I think you stole my heart now, baby
Probably just thievin'
I think I'm on fire,
probably just smokin'
I think that you're my dream girl
Probably just dreamin'
I think I'm the best, babe, come on
Probably like all the rest
I think that I could be your man, oh, probably just thinkin'

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

// All Of My Thoughts //

Don't know what to do by myself
Cause all of my time was with you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you
Don't know how to sleep on my own
Cause all of my dreams are of you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you
Don't know what to do by myself
Cause all of my time was with you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you

// Stay With Me //

Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time,
Don't Go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't Go
Love the it when you lie
Stay with me, hold me all of the time
Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time,
Don't Go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't Go
Love it when you lie
Stay with me, hold me all of the time
Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, I love it when you're mine
Don't go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, love it when you're mine
Don't go
I love you you're so fine

// Electricity //

Drivin' fast down a one way street,
Lord I love you you dance so sweet,
Goin' faster, hit the sky,
Lord I love it don't ask me why
Electricity, Let it rain all over me,
Let the light be forever green,
I'm playin' with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me turn it on
Drivin' fast babe I'm on my own
I'm gonna meet you on a one way road
Gonna crash, kiss the sky
Lord I love you don't ask me why
Electricity, Let it wash all over me,
Let the light be forever green,
I'm playin' with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me turn it on
Drivin' fast down a one way street,
Lord I love you you dance so neat,
Baby touch me hit the sky,
Baby touch me make me fly, I said
Electricity, Electricity, Electricity, Electricity
Turn it on.

// Home Of The Brave //

I don't even feel it
But lord how I need it
When I'm not with her
I'm not all myself
Sometimes have my breakfast right
Off of a mirror
And sometimes I have it
Right out of a bottle
Come on

I'm gonna rip it up
Tear it out
Gotta get it off of my soul
I don't even miss you

But that's 'cause I'm f**ked up
And sure when it wears off
Then I will be hurting
And just 'cause the sun shines
When you're out of my time
And just 'cause I feel bad
And feel good to fly high
Come on
Come on

I'm gonna rip it up
Tear it out
Gotta get you off of my soul

// Broken Heart //

Though I have a broken heart
I'm too busy to be heartbroken
There's a lot of things that need to be done
Lord I have a broken heart

Though I have a broken dream
I'm too busy to be dreaming of you
There's a lot of things that I gotta do
Lord I have a broken dream

And I'm wasted all the time
I've gotta drink you right off of my mind
I've been told that this will heal given time
Lord I have a broken heart

And I'm crying all the time
I have to keep it covered up with a smile
And I'll keep on moving on for a while
Lord I have a broken heart

// Cool Waves //

Baby when you gotta sleep
Lay your head down low
Don't let the world
Lay heavy on your soul
'Cause when you gotta sleep
You gotta sleep

Cool waves wash over me
Cool water running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you

Baby if you lose your love
Don't take me by surprise
Don't think you're crying
But there's teardrops in your eyes
If you gotta leave
You gotta leave

Cool waves wash over me
Cool water running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you

Babe you know you gotta be
And let your light shine through
And don't let anybody
Tell you what to do

'Cause babe you gotta be
You gotta be

Cool waves wash over me
Cool water running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you

// Cop Shoot Cop //

Hey man there's a hole in my arm where all the money goes
Jesus christ died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man there's a hole in my head where information goes
And all my friends died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man there's a hole in my reason that I gotta close
'cause all my love died for nothin' I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe

I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more
Desert is any place without you
oh my love, I'm pretty sure that you can feel that too
and loneliness, you know it hits me and it lasts for days
cause you're so sweet you make me feel like a child my babe
desert is where I find myself when i get blown
cause you're so sweet and I can't seem to find my way back home
if this is heaven, well you know that I'm not happy here
cause heaven ain't any place where you're not there
desert is any place without you my friend
and I will love you even if I'm getting to the end
cause you're so sweet I'm always wishing babe that you were here
desert is any place without you my dear
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
and I will love you
