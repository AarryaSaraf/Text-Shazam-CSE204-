// This Little Life Of Mine //

This little life of mine
I'll gonna let it slide
I'm gonna let it burn
Cuz I'm getting sick of trying
just gonna let it go down
I'm gonna leave it burn
Ain't gonna get to slow down
gonna get it up too much.
Ain't gonna take good care of it

This little baby of mine

I'm gonna let it down
Cuz I'm getting sick and tired
just gonna let it slow down
I'm gonna leave it burn
I'm gonna let it roll, baby,
I'm gonna let it roll [?]

This little life of mine
I'm gonna let it slide
I'm gonna let it burn
Cuz I'm getting sick of trying
Just gonna let it go down
I'm gonna leave burn
I'm gonna let it roll

Ain't gonna take good care of it baby [?]

// She Kissed Me (It Felt Like A Hit) //

Uptight in her little world
Got a feeling gonna mess around
I gotta fever running in my blood
Don't care if I'm misunderstood
Gonna shoot it up and take my high
Got a feeling it ain't gonna die
Gonna fuck it up and mess around
I gotta feeling it ain't coming down
Don't care if it's hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Uptight gonna drive me wild
Got me shaking like a little child
Got a devil cutting in my blood
Damn it baby if this ain't good
Got a fever gonna make it mine
Fuck it up, take it one more time
Little baby gonna get real fucked
I got a feeling gonna me up tonight
Don't care if this is hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Uptight in her little world
Got a feeling gonna mess around
Got a fever coming in my blood
Don't care if I'm misunderstood
Gonna shoot it up and take my high
Got a feeling it ain't gonna die
Gonna fuck it up and mess around
Got a feeling it ain't coming down
Don't care if this is hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Then she kissed me and it felt like a hit [x3]
Then she kissed me and it felt like this
Come on

// Hold On //

You got to hold on baby
to those who hold dear
and have gone to people
you love

cuz death cannot part us
if life already has
hold on to those you hold dear

you got to hold on
baby to those that you love
cuz hell's not below us
or heaven above

and death cannot say
what you're already lost
hold on to those you hold dear

you got a hold on baby
to those you hold dear

you get back the love
that you send

and time makes it harder
where words already failed

hold on to those you hold dear

got to hold on baby
to those who hold dear
and gone to the people
you love

cuz death cannot part us
if life already has

hold on to those you hold dear

// Oh Baby //

Darlin'
heaven's just a heartbeat away baby

you can do anything that you want to do and darlin'
you only get a lifetime to try baby
please don't let chances like this pass you by and baby
I can't tell you any more than I know so darlin'
reach out and take it all in as you go

// Lord Let It Rain On Me //

Jesus Christ,
When your back's against the wall
It's sure hard to be grateful
When you've nothing here at all
You say that Hell's below us, Lord
Heaven can be mine
I don't believe your promises
I don't believe your lies

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

Jesus Christ,
Look at what you've gone and done
2,000 years of lookin' down
The barrel of a gun
You got the fools believin'
That there's something else to gain
Jesus Christ,
When you comin' down again?

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

// The Ballad Of Richie Lee //

My soul is weak
my eyes are blind
the fire that drove me on
is nothing more than dust and ash
the day my friend was gone

Now we got his name on a rock again
this time it's the last

party is over fire

so put your hand in my hand
and maybe we'll forget
that life had even started
before the day we met

my rotten bones full of holes
skin just holds 'em in
might look like I'm damaged
but the damage is deep within

so put your hand in my hand
and maybe we'll forget
that life had even started
before the day we met

// Cheapster //

Well, you take it all so easy
Gonna lay it on my friends
Gonna lay it all on down now baby
Do it all again
I can just hold my time up
lay it against the wall
I can't just hold my tongue
I could for-fuckin'-get it all
I'm gonna lay my soul out
and then I'm gonna lay it all on you

Well you might not crave it all but you can learn from your mistakes
And the little heart of Jesus Christ's gonna lay it all to waste

It's a bitter pill to swallow
But I'll fuckin' neck 'em all
The further you go up now baby
The further you can fall
I'm gonna take my soul out and lay it back, oh babe, again, again

Well you may not be good looking but you haven't got no faith
Sometimes I get a mouthful when I only want a taste
Sometimes you kick the devil out but angels smash your face
You can lay the law out baby but I don't think I'll behave
I'm gonna lay my soul out and then I'm gonna take it out again
I'm gonna lay my soul out and then I'm going down, again, again
(yeah)

// Rated X //

If memory was written down
I'd cut it up and cross it out
Coz memory holds the hurt inside
all the pain and all the lies
And you might think that past is through

but the past goes right on through
and memory holds the hurt inside
Regret creeps up on you
So puit your hand into my hand
And baby we'll forget that life had even started before our hands had met

// Lay It Down Slow //

If you got dreams in your heart
why don't you share them with me?
and if dreams don't come true
I'll make sure that you're nightmares
are through

if you got pain in your heart
why don't you share it with me?
and we'll just wait and see
if it's half what it used to be

and lay it down slow
lay it down free
lay it down easy
but lay it on me

if you've got love in your heart
why don't you keep it with mine?
I can't promise a miracle
but I'll always be trying

and lay it down slow
lay it down free
lay it down easy
but lay it on me

lay it down easy
lay it on me

lay it down easy
but lay it on me
