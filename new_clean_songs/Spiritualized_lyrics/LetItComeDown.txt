Album: LetItComeDown

// On Fire //

this is how high we can fly,
before the sun melts the wax in our wings.
Lets see how fast we can go
before our eyes can't follow the road

I'm on fire
Theres no water for the flames
And I'm alive
with no one but myself to blame
and I'm proud
That I've never fallen down
and I have learned
all the truth is tragedy now

Lets see how fast we can live
until our times start slowing us down
just how much further we go
before we get our place in the ground

I'm on fire
Theres no water for the flames
And I'm alive
with no one but myself to blame
and I'm free
to do what I want to do
and I burn
all the faith has had me denied

Come on my love
Come on my child
let heaven flow
into your soul
let it come on down
ease away pain
you won't feel
that way again

Come on my love
Come on my child
let heaven flow
into your soul
let it come on down
let it come on down
let it come on down
let it come on down
into your soul
into your soul
into your soul
into your soul [repeated until fade out]

// Do It All Over Again //

You gotta hope for the best and the best looks good now baby
and I don't think a few words of sympathy will make your world go round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I get
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

I love you like I love the sun in the morning
But I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make you change your mind
I'm gonna spend the day in bed and I'm planning on sleeping my life away
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You've gotta hope for the best and the best looks great now baby
and I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make your world go round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I get
You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

You'd better come right down and do it all over again.

// Don't Just Do Something //

Sometime
They say that love is blind
But I think that dumb is what they had in mind
I could let it go, but I'd rather know
If I sit around, will another show

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
I could lay in bed, like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
If I may say myself
I'm not bad at life, I'm not good as well
And though life goes on, I can't plainly see
Just what is it for, if its not for meÂ ?

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Oh...babe...

I'm going nowhere, nowhere is where I wanna be
And then I'm good for nothing
Nothing is good enough for me

Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Oh, please..

I'm good for nothing.
Nothing is good enough for me.
Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Sometime
Opportunity passes right by me didn't even slow,
I can't breathe and think and I need a drink,
All this common sense made a fool of me.

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
I can lay in bed like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I get me all confused, and the resons why are confusing too
I could be with you, try to sort it out
If I tell the truth, I like to lie about

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
Although life goes on, I can't plainly see
All this common sense made a fool of me

I don't want to live but I can't resist

I've got some reasons and I made list

I'm gonna drown before my ship comes in

And I forgot to ring my mum again

and life ain't good without cigarettes...

// Out Of Sight //

Out of sight is always out of mind 
I think out of mind is out of sight 
I was just looking for some peace of mind 
I just couldn't find a peace of mine 

They say that pride comes just before a fall 
I have fallen and I wasn't sure 
You know that I have fallen further before 
I just cannot stand falling no more 

If I am good I could add years to my life 
I would rather add some life to my years 
Life is really what you make it they say 
I can't even make my mind up today 

The world keeps turning it keeps me in my place 
Where I stand is only three miles from space 
Standing space is all the space I can stand 
Gravity just keeps on keeping me down

// The Twelve Steps //

If you got the money for a rehab cure
You ain't got a problem you can't afford
I was very nearly clean you know
Cos I only had twelve steps to go

The only time I'm drink and drug free
Is when I don't have to pay for what I need
That's rare indeed

If your willpower's weak temptation's strong
Lord knows how we're going to get along
But the worst thing about your kind of disease
is you know who can charge whatever she pleases?
It's 28 days for 13 grand
Better go get myself and insurance plan
She's my man?

I ain't got to where I'm going to
by hanging round with people like you
But then again I ain't never got
anywhere I wanted to get to

I ain't got to where I'm going to
by hanging round with people ain't my friends
But then again I ain't never got
anywhere I wanted in the end

If you got the money for me how come
You ain't got a problem you can't afford
I was very nearly clean you know
Cos I only had twelve steps to go

The only time I'm drink and drug free
Is when I get my drugs and drink for free
That's the mean

If your willpower's weak temptation's strong
Lord knows how we're going to get along
And I don't think I'm gonna find Jesus Christ
So I'd rather spend my cash on vice

28 days for 13 grand
Better go get myself an insurance plan
She's my man

Do some knitting, get some rest
Group therapy gets me depressed
You might get banned if you relapse,
We'll take you back when you got some cash

You're just as likely to find inner peace
by buying your stuff from off the street, 
come on, come on

// The Straight And The Narrow //

The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

And if jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years

You know that I got a little something I should say
I guess that I'm just so easily led astray
It's alright because I know my own way back home from here

And I don't fall of the wagon you know
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow, this time.

And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

You know a little problem or two
I guess that I keep on taking a few
I've been told its not the best thing that I can do, right now

And I don't go looking for my sins you know
They come out waiting, and I just get on and go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time

And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

And if jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years

And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes, the devil makes, good use of these hands of mine

// I Didn't Mean To Hurt You //

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I can't get along

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you, dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I can't get along

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you, dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now.

I love you like I love the sunrise in the morning
I miss you like I miss the water when I'm burning
I didn't mean to hurt you dear
the words just came out wrong
Now I'm broken down and lonely
and I'm so colder now

// Stop Your Crying //

Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone you love,
There ain't nothing you can gain that prepares you enough

Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now,
Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone you care about,
If I could take it all myself, you know, I sure would,
Without a doubt

Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now,
Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone so close to you,
I feel so broke inside, but I'll devote my life to lovin' you...

Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now,
Come on baby, stop your crying,
Come on baby, stop your crying now

[repeat chorus to fade out]

// Anything More //

Though my body gets tired
My mind does it no favors at all
And theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And theres no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
Theres so little time
So do something, something, anything more

Don't cry,baby,cry
As long as you and I
Do more than just survive
Don't cry, have a real good life

And you know the things we do
Mean more to me than you
but the rain just came right through
Don't cry, we'll have a real good life

Though my body gets old
My mind does it no favors at all
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And there's no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
Theres so little time
So do something, something, anything more

Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying

// Won't Get To Heaven (The State I'm In) //

Lord I'm feeling so weary
I guess I'm tired of being alone
So give me one more chance
And Lord I will be coming home

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long

Lord, I'm feeling so lonely
I should have had it while I could
So give me one more chance
And Lord I will be home for good

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long

Come on babe hold my hand
We should take it while we can
Believe me now you know you're not alone

Come on babe hold my hand
We should take it while we can
Believe me now you know you're not alone

Lord I'm feeling so weary
You'd better call a doctor in
And give me one more chance
I won't get to heaven the state I'm in

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long

[bridge]

I'm hoping praying Lord I'm saying
I believe my time ain't long
[x4]
[x8]

// Lord Can You Hear Me //

Lord, help me out
I'd take my life, but I'm in doubt
Just where my soul will lie
Deep in the earth or way up in the sky

Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?

All my life has left my side
Can't get enough out of life to keep me satisfied
I'm lost about everything
Lord look what state I'm in

Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?

Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, when I call?
Lord can you hear me, hear me at all?
