// Chinatown //

Well, the moon is yellow and the people are too
They roll eggs on a bar-b-que
I was feeling kinda cocky with a head full of sake
Down in Chinatown

There was dragons flyin' kites high above the stores
Dead fish heads laying on the floor
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie
Down in Chinatown

And it was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa
Yeah, suddenly Yeah, Suddenly whoa whoa

They smelled fish
We smelled like a meat
Sucking on a soda pop oh so sweet
Got a sugar rush that'd would make a nigger blush
Down in Chinatown

Won ton two ton three ton four
Smoke a cigarette throw it on the floor
I killed the pie-faced mothey with a shoeshine clothy
Down in Chinatown

It was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa
Yeah, suddenly, Yeah, suddenly whoa whoa

The moonie is yellowie and the people are too
They roll eggs on a bar-b-que
I was feeling kinda cocky with head full of Saki
Down in Chinatown

I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie
Down in Chinatown
Hey, down in Chinatown
Hey, down in Chinatown

// Automobile //

February morning, my car won't start today
I turned the key at 8:03 and the battery passed away
Inside a' my automobile
I want my automobile
I want my automobile
I want to drive it all around this world

Bride's gettin' married in the Springtime
Widow's gettin married in the Fall
I got married in high school
Or I wouldn't of got married at all
I'd be drivin' my automobile
Be drivin' my automobile
Be drivin' my automobile
I wanna drive it all around this world

Everybody said to the new groom
Groom, what ya gonna be
I said I'm gonna be a symphony
Just as soon as I find a key
To my automobile
I want my automobile
I want my automobile
All around this world

[Spoken:]
Let's take a ride

Columbus sailed the ocean
Moses parted the sea
Dolores left me yesterday
Well, I think she took the key
To my automobile
I want my automobile
I want my automobile
Wanna drive it all around this world

Now I held a little bitty baby
I held a woman all night
Whenever I get the hiccups
I hold my breath 'til my head gets light
Then I drive my automobile
Yeah I drive my automobile
I drive my automobile
I'm want to drive it all around this world

February morning, my car won't start today
Yeah, I turned the key at 8:03
And the battery passed away
Inside a' my automobile
I'm drivin' my automobile
Wanna my automobile
Wanna drive it all around this world
Go on.

[Spoken:]
It is a beautiful day for a ride
Hey, get your head down I can't see anything
Someone give me a cigarette
I don't want to take my hands off the wheel
We ought to take the air filter off this sucker.
So we can see what it will really do.
Uh oh, it looks to me like a HOS-PITAL Zone
Everybody get quiet. Shhhhhhhh.
Don't wake the dead up.
We're almost out. Hang on. Uh Oh here we go.
Well, you can just hold it until we get to the next town.

// Killing The Blues //

Leaves were falling..Just like embers
In colors red and gold they set us on fire
Burning just like a moonbeam...in our eyes

[Chorus:]
Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud.
Killing the Blues

I am guilty of something
I hope you never do because there is nothing
Sadder than losing.. yourself in love

[Chorus 2x]

Now, you ask me Just to leave you
To go out on my own and get what I need to
You want me to find..what I've already had

[Chorus 4x]

// No Name Girl //

I got a girl that ain't got no home
She ain't very fat just skin and bones
She don't cast no shadow because she's so thin
Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been
She Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been

The girl I love ain't got no name
But I love her just the same
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin
She never know where she going but know were she's been
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been
Never know where she going but she knows were she's been

[Instrumental]

She's six feet tall and got long black hair
Runs around in her sack dress but I don't care
She got great big feet with size number 10
She never know where she going but know were she's been
She never know where she going but know were she's been

[Instrumental]

The girl I love ain't got no name
But I love her just the same
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin
She never know where she going but know were she's been
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been
She never know where she going but know were she's been
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been
She never know where she going but know were she's been
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been
She never know where she going
She never knows where she going
She never know where she going
She never knows where she going
She never know where she going now
But she know were she's been Ugh...
She never know where she going
Never know where she going
But I know were she's been.

// Saigon //

You got everything that a girl should grow
I'm so afraid to kiss you I might lose control
You can hold me tighter but turn loose of my gun
It's a sentimental present all the way from Saigon
Honey, Honey, Honey, please call me
You don't need no money we can do it for free
I got a friend in Phoenix with a two-way radio
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow

I was talking to the mailman late last week
He had a letter in his sweater from Stuttering Don
He said things are getting better in Sa, Sa, Sa, Sa, Sa

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

// This Cold War With You //

The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue
Even another night of this cold war with you
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through

Oh, why oh why should love ever come
To a couple like you and me
Who's cold cold wars are never done
And hearts can't be free
So, let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you

The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue
Even another night of this cold war with you
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through

Oh, why oh why should love ever come
To a couple like you and me
Who's cold cold wars are never done
And hearts can't be free
So, let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you

// Baby Let's Play House //

You may go to college.
You may go to school
You might drive a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool

Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you

Listen to me baby.
What I'm talking about
Come on back me Little girl
So we can play some house.

Come back baby Come back
Come back baby gone.
Come back baby I want to play house with you

Well, there's just one thing baby
That I want you to know
Come on back we can play a little house
And we act like we did before.

Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you

Listen to me baby.
Try to understand
I rather see you dead little girl
Than see you with another man

Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. Come back.
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you

// Down By The Side Of The Road //

Her Father was a failure
Her Mother was a comfort
To a doctor and lawyer and Indian Chief.
The shirt ran out of buttons
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game
And they went on Relief.
The bank took away their diplomas
They locked them up inside of the chest
And she moved away to Oklahoma
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast
"God-Damn, My socks are still hard"
From lying on the sofa on the night she was over in my backyard
Yeah, We was shooting the breeze out amongst the trees
When a shot rang low
And left her standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road

Father have mercy, Whoo Whoo
Get her a nurse please
She's almost alone
I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone
We rather see her locked up inside a home
Than see her standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind.
Yonder comes a truck it drove by two men.
Shotgun man leaned out and said do you want to take a ride?
Out in the pale moonlight Light light Light Lie Lie Lie lie

Too long in the hot sun
She could've be Miss Wisconsin a long time ago
Spent to much time inside of the early show
We'd bought her a ticket but she didn't want to go
She was standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road

Headlights flashing, caught a skirt in the wind.
Yonder comes a truck it drove by two men.
Shotgun man leaned out and said do you want to take a ride?
Out in through the pale moonlight

Her Father was a failure
Her Mother was a comfort
To a doctor and lawyer and Indian Chief.
The shirt made out of buttons
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game
And they went on Relief.
The bank took away their diplomas
They locked them up inside of the chest
And she moved away to Oklahoma
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast

God-Damn, My thoughts are still hard.
From lying on the sofa on the night she was over in my backyard

Yeah, We was shooting the breeze out amongst the trees
When a shot rang low
And left her standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road

// How Lucky //

Today I walked down the street I use to wander
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, How lucky can one man get.

I bronzed my shoes and hung from a rearview mirror
Bronzed admiration in the blind spot of regret
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, How lucky can one man get.

Today I walked down the street I use to wander
Yeah, scratched my head and lit my cigarette
Well, There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, How lucky can one man get.

Today I walked down the street I use to wander
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, How lucky can one man get.
Hey, How lucky can one man get.
Hey, How lucky can
One...
Man...
Get.

// Ubangi Stomp //

Well, I rocked over Italy and I rocked over Spain
I Rocked in Memphis it was all the same
Till I rocked to Africa and rolled off ship.
And seen them natives doing a odd looking skip
I parted the weeds and looked over the swamp
I seen them cats doing the Ubangi Stomp

Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi stomp Ubangi style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild

Well, I looked up the chief and he invited me in
Said a heap big jam session 'bout to begin
He handed me a tom-tom I picked up the beat
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet
Rocked and rolled and I skipped with a smile
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style

Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild

Well, we rocked all night and part of the day
Had a good rocking time with the chief's daughter Mae
I was making time and gettin' in the know
The Captain said son we gotta go.
I said that's alright. You go on ahead
I'm gonna Ubangi Stomp until I roll over dead

Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that you ever told
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
