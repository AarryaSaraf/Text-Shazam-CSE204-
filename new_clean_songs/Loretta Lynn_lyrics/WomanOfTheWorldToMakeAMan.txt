// Woman Of The World (Leave My World Alone) //

You came from the city streets to my little country town
Your spell is on my baby and you've got me sorrow bound
You don't really love him you're playin' around for fun
Woman of the world leave my world alone
You're the devil's woman that's what my man don't know
Why I wear more in swimmin' than you wear to parties where you go
There's a place I know where you should go for that's where you belong
Woman of the world leave my world alone

I don't know about the things the bright lights talk to you
My country boy don't know them any better than I do
I'll have to watch him hurtin' after you are gone
Woman of the world leave my world alone
You're the devil's woman...

// Johnny One Time //

So he told you you're the dream that he's been searching for
And he told you that he'd never met anyone like you before
And I can hear him telling you your lips taste just like sherry wine
But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time
So he told you that he'd never lead your heart astray
And he told you that he'd love you forever and a day
And I can hear him telling you that he's the shy and bashful kind
But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time
Did he tell you that your heart will soon become
Another trinket on his bracelets of broken hearts
Did he tell you that the morning sun will find you
Patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts
Did he tell you that the special love you're savin'
Will disappear in shame and flames like mine
Did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time
Did he tell you that your heart...
Did he tell you that your heart...

// If You Were Mine To Lose //

If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go
Cause that would mean you once belonged to me
I'd gladly face the heartache of losin' you some day
Cause then at least I'd have a memory
Through all the years I've known you you've never noticed me
Just a friend that's all I've been to you
I'd gladly let you break my heart for just one memory
Just to know that you were mine to lose
If I could only hold you just one time for one short moment heaven would be mine
If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go just to know that you were mine to lose
[ piano ]
If I could only hold you...
