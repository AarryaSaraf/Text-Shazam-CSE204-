Album: BreakItYourself

// Desperation Breeds... //

Beekeeper sing of your frustration
In this litigious breeze
Of accidental pollination
In this era without bees

We keep breeding desperation
In this era of thieves
Who keep stealing respiration
From the tenderest of trees

This peculiar incantation
Sure you heard it before
Instead of breeding desperation
Make me a pallet on your floor

// Danse Caribe //

You were a shameless child
Bandied by stiff cross currents
Anything but mild
Yes and no just simply weren't
Invented yet
Oh yes oh no

Then one day you'd had it
Exiled your close advisors
Ousted your dog-eared rabbits
You're through with pacifizers
You're through with pacifizers now

Here we go mistaking clouds for mountains
Here's the thing that brings the sparrows to the fountains
Here's the thing that makes you run for the highlands
Here we go mistaking clouds for mountains
Autonomy

// Give It Away //

Did you give it away
Did you give it away for free
Don't you give it away
Let's try to keep it in the family
I know you know desolation
Coming home with your pockets full of sand
I know it's no vacation
Now you're plowing your tiny patch of land
In a nation under your command
Did you give it away
Yeah I gave it away
Did you give it away for free
What would you have us pay?
I didn't know that your love was a commodity
What about appreciation
That depends on your depth and density
What about inflation
Your charts and graphs don't mean a thing to me
In your nation with its worthless currency

Would you hide in the hay
Would you hide in the hay with me
Won't you hide in the hay
Where it's dark and we can scarcely breathe or see
Assured asphyxiation
Where the foxes and field mice make their dens
Death by association
I swore I'd never take anyone there again
To this nation
A nation under your command

// Eyeoneye //

Go ahead and congratulate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
When the eye that eyes itself is your eye
And the ear that hears itself is near
Then you're getting too close to your source
You've done the impossible now
You took yourself apart
Made yourself invulnerable
No one can break your heart
So you break it yourself

Bringing your own
Break it yourself

Go ahead and reionize yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is your hand
And you go ahead and wring it out
And you go ahead and stretch it out
And you go ahead and wear it inside out
Day trip in the desert makes this
Boy and girl too wise
Through a raging wall of sand that's
One hundred stories high
So you reionionionize
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneyeoneye
All this time it took to realize
That you could use some help
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Bringing your heart breaking the shell
Go ahead and defibrillate yourself
Give yourself a hand the hand is yours
And you go ahead and wring it out
You go ahead and stretch it out
You go ahead and wear it inside out
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye
And it's eyeoneyeoneyeoneye

// Lazy Projector //

If memory serves us, then who owns the master
How do we know who's projecting this reel
And is it like gruel or like quick drying plaster
Tell me how long til the paint starts to peel

Is it like Pyramus or Apollo or an archer we don't know
Though history repeats itself, and time's a crooked bow
Come on tell us something we don't know

Now who's the best boy and the casting director
And the editor splicing your face from the scene
It's all in the hands of a lazy projector
That forgetting, embellishing, lying machine
That forgetting, embellishing, lying machine

They say all good things must come to an end
Everyday the night must fall
How it all came to this, I simply can't recall
Too many cooks in the kitchen
How the mighty must fall

But I can't see the sense in us breaking up at all
I can't see the sense in us breaking up at all
I can't see the sense in us breaking up at all
Breaking up at all

And it's all in the hands of a lazy projector
That forgetting, embellishing, lying machine

// Near Death Experience Experience //

You used to be like toffee,
Between the kitten's teeth -
You used to build arid shelters out of sticks and leaves and
spend the whole day underneath.

You used to be like copper -
Pliable but strong,
You used to smile and nod, say "you're right," be polite,
When you know that everybody's wrong.

So you dare the plane to crash,
redeem the miles for cash when it starts to dive
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like we're grateful simply to be alive.

Dare the plane to crash,
redeem the miles for cash
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like your prognosis was that you should've died.

No, there's nothing wrong; there's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivors -
like we're grateful simply to be alive

No, there's nothing wrong; there's nothing wrong when it starts to down
And we'll dance like cancer survivors

// Lusitania //

If your loose and libel lips
Keep sinking all my ships
Then you're the one who sank my Lusitania
But some how it don't register as pain at all
Till it finds your crooked vein
It should help us not remember the Maine
You're laying mines along your shore
Through my hull it ripped and tore
We don't study this war no more

So we let our back bones slip
Till the arc spits from our fingertips
And we'll become a hazard in the rain
Oh and we'll get charged out in the rain
There's a sixty-cycle hum
Go ahead say something dumb
Boy there's no shame
There's no shame

Go ahead say something dumb boy
There's no shame

// Orpheo Looks Back //

And there are places we must go to
To bring these hollow words on back from
You must cross a muddy river
Where love turns to love turns to fear
They say you don't look
There's only one way
On back from on back from here
They say you don't look 
They say you don't look cause it'll disappear

And our eyes they keep on strainin'
As if to see what lies behind them
Through the shells of empty buildings and great columns of glass
They say you don't look
They say you don't look
Cause it'll drive you mad
And if it drives you mad
If it drives you mad
It'll prob'ly pass

// Sifters //

Sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before
What if I were the night sky
I were the night sky
Is my lullaby to leave burn

What if we hadn't been born at the same time
What if you were 75 and I were 9
Would I come visit you
Bring you cookies in an old folks home
Would you be there alone
And when the late summer lightning fires off in your arms
Will I remember to breathe no I never will
And if I could convince you that I mean you no harm
Just want to show you how not to need
If I were the night sky
If I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby
My lullaby to leave by
My lullaby to leave by
If I were the night

What if we hadn't been each other at the same time
Would you tell me all the stories from when you're young and in your prime
Would I rock you to sleep
Would you tell me all the secrets you don't need to keep
Would I still miss you
Or would you then have been mine

Sound is a wave like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin

// Fatal Shore //

Would it be easier so much easier
If you never knew us
Would you ever fear anymore
If you never knew us
Would we meet on a fatal shore
On a fatal shore?

When are you comin to shore
To never fear anymore
You never know any doubt
Like we who breathe in and out

Are you a breather
Mail receiver?
If you could see right through us
Through our clothes and through our pores
If you could see right through us
You're gonna run into your homes and lock your doors

// Hole In The Ocean Floor //

I woke with a start
Crying bullets, beating heart
To hear all God's creatures
Roaring again

Not a cricket was creaking,
Or a floorboard was squeaking,
And all the world was snoring again

There's a hole in the ocean floor
There's a hole in the ocean floor
Gonna stop bleeding alone

I woke with a start
Crying bullets, beating heart
To hear all God's creatures
Roaring again...
