// Action / Adventure //

Now if you think I'm wasting your time again
I'm wasting your time
When you pick me up in duty free
That's when I thought I'd be the cross in your T
Or must see TV

Tram pam pam pam, but
If you think I'm wasting your time again
No, oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team

Oooh please don't get too excited
Oooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream

So when you think you're on the fast track
You find it's just a cul-de-sac back
In that adult lifestyle community
Where all your little boys, your action toys are duty free

Oooh please don't get too excited
Ooooh maybe you're not invited
To my action adventure
My action adventure dream

So I wonder what you got your persona for
Cause there's a 2-for-one down at the corner-store
And I wonder could ya pep it up a bit
You know throw a fit
You go ahead and dance
I'll just sit

If you think I'm wasting your time again
I'm wasting your time again
oh, you're wasting mine
When you're playing for a prime-time dream
The CNB scene
Now I'm just a split in your seam the I in your team

So I'm looking at the back of my hand again
Oh, I'm looking at the back of my hand again,
To what end if I can't even find a goddamn pen

// First Song //

Then it was dusk in Illinois
a small boy, after an afternoon of carting dung hung
on a rail fence, a sapped thing
weary to crying

dark was growing tall
he began to hear the pond frogs all calling on his ear
they were calling on his ears with what seemed their joy

soon the sound was pleasant for a boy
listening in the smoky dusk and nightfall of illinois
and from the fields two small boys came
bearing cornstalk violins
so they rubbed the cornstalk bows with resins
and the three just sat there scraping of the joy
of their joy, they're scraping of the joy

it was now fine music
the frogs and the boys did
in the towering illinois twilight make and into dark
in spite a shoulder's ache
a boy's hunched body loved out of a stalk
the first song of his happiness
and the song woke his heart into the darkness and sadness of joy

dark was growing tall
he began to hear the pond frogs all calling on his ear
they were calling on his ear with what seemed their joy

// I //

We're keeping busy yeah we're bleeding stones
With our machinations and our palindromes
Anything but hear a voice
Anything but hear a voice
Anything but hear a voice
That says we're basically alone
Says we're basically alone

We're keeping busy yeah we're bleeding stones
With our machinations and our palindromes
Anything but hear a voice
That says we're basically alone
Says we're basically alone
Says we're basically alone

We're keeping busy yeah we're bleeding stones
With our machinations and our palindromes
Anything but hear a voice
Anything but hear a voice
That says we're basically alone
Says we're basically alone
Says we're basically alone

// Lull //

Being alone, it can be quite romantic
Like Jacques Cousteau underneath the Atlantic
A fantastic voyage to parts unknown
Going to depths where the sun's never shone
And I fascinate myself when I'm alone

So I go a little overboard, but hang on to the hull
While I'm airbrushing fantasy art on a life
That's really kind of dull
Oh, I'm in a lull

I'm all for moderation, but sometimes it seems
Moderation itself can be a kind of extreme
So I joined the congregation
I joined the softball team
I went in for my confirmation
Where incense looks like steam
I start conjugating proverbs
Where once there were nouns
This whole damn rhyme scheme's
Starting to get me down

Oh, I'm in a lull
I'm in a lull

Being alone, it can be quite romantic
Like Jacques Cousteau underneath the Atlantic
A fantastic voyage to parts unknown
Going to depths where the sun's never shone
And I fascinate myself, sure I do
When I'm alone

I'm rambling on rather self-consciously
While I'm stirring these condiments into my tea
And I think I'm so vain, I bet I think this song's about me
Don't I, don't I, don't I?

I'm in a lull...

// Weather Systems //

Quiet
quiet down she said
speaking to the back of his head
on the edge of her bed
I can see your blood flow
your cells grow

hold still a while
don't spill the wine
I can see it all from here
I can see
I can see
weather systems of the world

and every time you turn the soil
another cloud begins to boil

some things you say
are not for sale
I would hold that we're
all free agents
of a substance or scale

hold still a while
don't spill the wine
I can see it all from here
I can see
I can see
weather systems of the world
