// Capsized //

Now when you wake up
Night's falling someone is by your side
Pull it together, darling you're not alone

But when you break up
Sky's falling no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

Just keep your lamp on

Now he's a dyin' bed maker
He's a dyin' bed maker Jesus gonna make my...
It's a holy ghost, holy ghost religion
It's a holy ghost religion Jesus gonna make my...

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized
And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

And when you wake up
Night's falling someone is by your side
Pull it together, darling you're not alone

But when you break up
Sky's falling no one is on your side
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone
Spoon dirty laundry, darling you're all alone

And when you wake up, another sunrise
Another break up, this ship is capsized

// Roma Fade //

See her light, how it reigns
So hard on your high plains
So you take such pains
That she won't notice you
And your x-rays
Of your paleo-male gaze
How they rest, and play
Slowly corrupting you
I wonder what the chance is you want it to
A thousand vacant stares won't make it true
Make it true

You need a witness just to know you're there
From the tips of your fingers, every strand of hair
And know someone's watching you
Watching me, watching you
And all that we look upon
You may not know me but you feel my stare

And if she sees you, it changes you
Rearranges your molecules
And if you see her, it changes her
She's a danger now after school
And if she sees you, it changes you
Rearranges your molecules
And if you see her, it changes her
She'll be seeing you after school
Here's where gentlemen avert their eyes
Maybe she's a gentleman in disguise
In disguise

You need a witness just to know you're there
From the tips of your fingers, every strand of hair
And know someone's watching you
Watching me, watching you
And all that we look upon
You may not know me but you feel my
Stare

And if I see you, how it changes me
And if you see me, how it changes you
Changes you
And if I see you, how it changes me
And if you see me, how it changes you
Changes you

// Truth Lies Low //

Here's a little game
You can play along
Oh you do the walk of shame
From the comfort of your home
So here's another game
You can play along
Where you empty all your blame
From your guilty bones

Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, will know (the eyes will know)
Like a thousand tiny suns that glow (they're burning a hole)
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes will know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

So here's another game...

Fools are taking aim
They got pistols in their phones
Holocene is on the wane
We got plastic in our stones

Oh the lies, the lies, the lies will grow (the lies will grow)
Like a thousand tributaries flow (the eyes will know)
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, will know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

Vitriol from their pens flows
Anonymously their hate grows
But at least they care enough
At least they care enough
At least they care enough
To let you know

// Puma //

Do you see particles in the air?
Unguided particles in the air
Do you see particles in the air?
Nobody know notices, nobody cares, oh
Don't try to tell her she's less feline than human

'Cause it gives rise to the rumor she's a girl and not a puma
And that light that shines is not a pearl, it's just a tumor

She was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to be holding her anyways
But the doctors, they told me to stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays, oh

Do you see particles?
Unguided particles
Particles
Don't try to tell her that she's less feline than human

'Cause it gives rise to the rumor she's a girl and not a puma
Don't try to tell her she's a girl, that's just a rumor

And she was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to be holding her anyway
But the doctors, they told me to stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays
She was radioactive for seven days
How I wanted to be holding her anyway
But the doctors, they told me just stay away
Due to flying neutrinos and the gamma rays

// Chemical Switches //

I keep hearing a vicious rumor
From the backrooms, to the aisles, to the avenues
That you lost your sense of humor
And the first place you look is the soles of your shoes

And I watch these ice fields melt into the sea
Warming you're oceans to centuries
Will your saline waters bring you back to me?
All the weight is bringing me to my knees

Chemical switches thrown in the dark
All it takes is a spark to begin
And can you tell which is a one with a mark?
Bleeds through the clothes to the skin

Too long I keep searching the aisles and avenues
But it seems I'm doing it wrong
For I've seen neither hide nor hair of you

And it's a short short walk from pebbles to bricks
From stones back to sticks
We're lowering the boiling point
And as time goes back it's harder to fix
It's a volatile mix, like hydrogen and oxygen

Chemical switches thrown in the dark
All it takes is a spark to begin

// Left Handed Kisses //

[Andrew Bird & Fiona Apple:]
I don't believe everything happens for a reason
To us romantics out here, that amounts to high treason
I don't go in for your star-crossed lovers
In the heart of a skeptic
There's a question that still hovers near

[Andrew Bird:]
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Now you got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here, baby

[Fiona Apple:]
And all your left handed kisses
Were just prelude to another
Prelude to your backhanded love song, baby

[Andrew Bird:]
But it begs a question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
Got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here

[Fiona Apple:]
The point your song here misses
Is that if you really loved me
You'd risk more than a few 50 cent
Words in your backhanded love song

[Andrew Bird & Fiona Apple:]
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean

The point your song here misses
You got me writing love songs
Is that you really love me
With a common refrain like this one here, baby
Is prelude to another of your backhanded love songs

Now it's time for a handsome little bookend
Now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
Am I still a skeptic or did you make me a believer?
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver

// Are You Serious //

Used to have just one foot out the door
Yeah, I always wanted more
I always was the one
You thought would never marry
Used to be willfully obtuse
(or is the word abstruse?)
Semantics like a noose
Get out your dictionaries

I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

So tell me, are you serious?
Are you serious?
Cause every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious!
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it?

I see that you're down there and on the pier
Your boyfriend's gone to get a beer
Leaving us crystal clear lines of communications
Promise me you won't avert your eyes
I drop my flippers in disguise
You know it's time to do or die
No useless explanations

I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

Tell me, are you serious?
Are you serious?
Every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious!
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it?

// Saints Preservus //

I once was found
But now I'm lost
I could be anywhere
Where the strip malls are beige
And the asphalt is hot
Bring me your poor
And your trembling masses
Bring them here
To shelter in your soft-structured parking lot

I'm a stranger
In a land that's anything but strange
Bury me standing
Bury me deep
Beneath the pylons

I'm groping in the dark
My arms stretched out before me
Saints, preserve us
Beneath your cracks and fissures
Among the fossiled fishes
Our souls, our souls to keep

I'm a stranger
In a land that's anything but strange
Bury me standing
Oh, bury me deep
Beneath the pylons

I'm groping in the dark
My arms stretched out before me
Saints, preserve us
Beneath your cracks and fissures
Among the fossiled fishes
Our souls, our souls to keep

// The New Saint Jude //

Come on, all you stand-up men
You self-empowered beginners
And all your lucky ladies
To whom you write your letters

I keep moving through my days
As if I had never met her
But ever since I, I gave up hope
I've been feeling so much better
Yeah I'm feelin' so much better
But ever since I gave up hope
I've been feelin' so much better

So here's a mighty revelation
That's sure to cure what ails ya
That everyone's just a disappointment
And everyone's a failure

And this we shall celebrate
In our finest regalia
Like a choir of shining angels
A congregation of Mahalias

I'm feelin' so much better
Ever since I thought I gave up hope
I've been feeling so much better

You hear that bell now
You hear it ringing
You hear it ringing
The bells of St. Jude

So fill your lungs now
'Cause we'll be singin'
We'll be singin'
We love you, St. Jude
We'll be singin'
We love you, St. Jude

Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better
Feelin' so much better

// Valleys Of The Young //

Do you need a reason
We should commit treason
And bring into this world a son

And leave the valleys of the young
Valleys of the young
Valleys of brunch and tedium

Well, your friends will become strange to you
Just as you will become strange to them
You'll live across a great divide
And the problems that seem like luxuries
They're off getting stoned and hugging trees
All the things you'll be forsaking
Still our hearts are constantly breaking

From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish, or is it brave?

Nana nanananana
Nananana
Nananana nanana

Do you need a reason we've
Been making all to become three
And believe in this holy valley

Land of brunch and misery
I'm living on
The valleys of the young

Now you're going on 64
Driving down 65, to the hospital
To see if your adult son will survive or not
After taking those pills in the parking lot
You know the one behind the Marriott
This is a dream you won't be waking
Still our hearts are constantly breaking

From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish, is it brave?
From their cradle to our grave
Is it selfish or is it brave?

// Bellevue //

Now I find someone who can slake my thirst in a land beset by drought
Feeds my hungry heart when it feels like fallow

Now I find myself always on the ins and never on the outs
Who guides my lonely ships on through the shallows

I think I found someone

// Shoulder Mountain //

You walk into a room
And you are instantly feeling uncomfortable
But it was cold outside
Figures sodden and smug and impenetrable

They have their backs to you
And their shoulders are forming a mountain range
They don't invite you in
Though you are of their ilk and by no means strange

When you finally find your family
Will you be turning your back on your former self?
It's a story of hypocrisy
Once was poor, is now a man of wealth

Will he be turning his back on his former self?
Will he be turning his back?
Turning his back again?
Turning your back again?
Turning your back again on your former self

How do I know when a stranger's not a god in disguise
Who will fallow your fields and make you bleed from your eyes
Rain fires from the skies
And for God sakes
Open your door

They have their backs to you
They don't invite you in

Turning your back on your former self
Will you be turning your back?
Turning your back again
Turning your back on your former self

You walk into a room
And you are instantly feeling uncomfortable
But it was cold outside
Figures sodden and smug and impenetrable

How do I know when a stranger's not a god in disguise
Who fallow your fields and make you bleed from y our eyes
Rain fires from the skies
And for god sakes
Open your door

// Pulaski //

Half empty, half full
Cup runneth over
Horns of plenty, coffers full
We're starting over

I write you a story
But it loses its thread
And all of my witnesses
Keep turning up, turning up dead

I paint you a picture
Of Pulaski at night
Greetings from Chicago
City of, city of light
Come back to Chicago

(Oooh, starting over)
(Oooh, starting over)

I paint you a picture
But it never looks right
Cause I fill in the shadows
And block out the, block out the light

I send you this postcard
It says, "Pulaski at night"
Greetings from Chicago
City of, city of light
Come back to Chicago
City of, city of light
Come back to Chicago

(Oooh, starting over)
(Oooh, starting over)

Half empty, half full
Cup runneth over

// Trimmed And Burning //

I said no, don't worry
no, please don't worry
no, don't worry
see what the Lord has done

just keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
keep your lamp trimmed and burning
keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
see what the Lord has done

I said no, don't worry
no no don't worry
no, don't worry
she what the Lord has done

just keep your lamp ...ed and and burning
keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
keep your lamp ...ed and burning
oh, see what the Lord has
