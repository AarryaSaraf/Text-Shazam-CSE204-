Album: WE

// Age Of Anxiety I //

It's the age of doubt
And I doubt we'll figure it out
Is it you or is it me?
Age of anxiety
(Are you talking to me?)

Fight the fever with TV
In the age where nobody sleeps
And the pills do nothing for me
In the age of anxiety

When I look at you
I see what you want me to, see what you want me to
When you look at me
See what I want you to see
What I want you to see

In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of

It's a maze of mirrors
It's a hologram of a ghost
And you can't quite touch it
Which is how it hurts us the most

So we keep it all inside
And hide it deep in a drawer
Say your prayers tonight
Someone finds it after the war

And when I look at you
I see what you want me to, see what you want me to
When you look at me
See what I want you to see
What I want you to see is me

In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
In the age of
Living in the age of
Living in the age of
Anxiety

Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me
Gotta get the spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me

Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby
Gotta get this spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby

'Cause I can't stop crying and I really think I mean it but
The tears mean nothing to me
Another lost alien arriving on my spaceship in the age of anxiety
We can't stop crying and we really think we mean it
But the tears just fall on the sheets
Another lost soul just trying to feel something
Trying to feel something
Trying to feel something in the age of

Are you talking to me
Or about me?
Am I talking to you
Or about you?

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)
It's all about you (It's not about you)

// End Of The Empire I-III //

One last dance
Here at the end of the empire
Makes me cry
Watchin' the moon on the ocean
Where California used to be

It's not half bad, uh-oh
Spend half your life bein' sad, whoa
Don't be scared, uh-oh
Just chronically impaired, uh-oh
Just take my hand, uh-oh
Standin' at the end of
The American Empire

One last song
Here at the end of the movie
They seemed so sure
At least, that's the way I remember
The war
What New York used to be

It's not half bad, no
Spend half your life being sad, whoa
Don't you weep, uh-oh
Half your life, fast asleep, uh-oh
Feelin' uninspired, uh-oh
Standin' at the end of
The American Empire

And we know that it's time to go
Heard the news on the radio
One last round before we go
Through the pale, atmospheric glow

And the oxygen's getting low
Sing a song that we used to know
One last round before we go
One last round before we go

So sad

Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink, and I
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losin' you
Didn't use to get low
This time of night, and I
Didn't use to walk home
In the mornin' light without you
Without you

Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losin' you
You, but I do

It's you and I
It's do or die
Suicide mission
Baby, by my side
We got one life and half of it's gone
You know, I can't sleep with the television on
Didn't use to get high
With you by my side
Leave the light on

// End Of the Empire IV (Sagittarius A*) //

I unsubscribe
I unsubscribe
This ain't no way of life
I don't believe the hype

She unsubscribes
She unsubscribes
She says
"There's diamonds in your eyes"
High on her own supply
She says
"The air WE're breathin'
Is from an exhaust pipe
Just a prototype"

Midway through life
(Unsubscribe)
Virgil said "Let's take a ride"
(Unsubscribe)
You'll need a divine guide (This ain't no way of life)
'Cause this inferno's hyperdrive (I don't believe the hype)
And the dreams in your head
The algorithm prescribed
Do you feel alright?

Your heroes are selling you underwear
And little white pills for your despair

(Little black space between the stars
Dream of crashing expensive cars)

One Christ Child
And one on the way
Why don't WE name her

Sagittarius A*
What a pretty name

We unsubscribe
(Unsubscribe)
Fuck season five
(Unsubscribe)
And anyway
The clothes don't fit me right (This ain't no way of life)
Must be the wrong body type (I don't believe the hype)
And the space where they say
Heaven is gone away

Sagittarius A*
We'll see one day
What's on the other side

// The Lightning I //

Fourth place anthem playing tonight
On a broken radio
Thought WE reached the mountaintop, but now
WE just feel so low
The sky is breaking open
WE keep hoping in the distance
WE'll see a glow
Lightning light our way
Till the black sky turns back to indigo

WE can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
WE can make it, baby, please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you

WE were born in paradise beneath a poisoned sky
Under a bad sign, the micro-age of gemini
And WE are still unlearning
Tires are burning in the middle of Rodeo Drive
You know that WE've been beat down and broken
But now WE can testify

WE can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
WE can make it, baby, please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you, don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you

It's not up to YOU some you win, some you lose
(When the lightning comes)
YOU don't get to choose, some you win, some you lose
(When the lightning comes)

// The Lightning II //

I heard the thunder on a blue sky perfect day, I wonder why
Am I the only one?
I heard the thunder and I feel I'm going under, Jesus Christ
Was an only son

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?

I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer, but I find
I got the question wrong
I was trying to run away but a voice told me to stay
And put the feeling in a song

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?

// Unconditional I (Lookout Kid) //

Lookout kid, trust your heart
You don't have to play the part they wrote for you
Just be true
There are things that you could do
That no one else on earth could ever do
But I can't teach you, I can't teach it to you

Lookout kid, trust your mind
But you can't trust it everytime
You know it plays tricks on you
And it don't give a damn if you are happy or you're sad
But if you've lost it, don't feel bad
'Cause it's alright to be sad

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do

Lookout kid, trust your body
You can dance, and you can shake
Things will break, you make mistakes
You lose your friends, again and again
'Cause nothing is ever perfect
No one's perfect
Let me say it again: no one's perfect
Right

A lifetime of skinned knees
And heartbreak comes so easy
But a life without pain would be boring

And if you feel it, it's fine
I give you everything that's mine
I give you my heart and my precious time

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do

Lookout kid, trust your soul
It ain't hard to rock n' roll
You know how to move your hips
And you know God is cool with it
Some people want the rock without the roll
But we all know, there's no God without soul
Right

A lifetime of skinned knees
And heartbreak comes so easily
But a life without you
Would be boring for someone like me

And if you feel it, it's fine
I give you everything that's mine
I give you my heart and my precious time
(Precious time)
(I'll give you everything)
I give you my heart and my precious time

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do

Unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
No matter what you do
It's unconditional (Unconditional)
It's unconditional (Unconditional)
Unconditonal (No matter what you do)
It's unconditional (Unconditional)

// Unconditional II (Race And Religion) //

At the crossroad
There's a street sign
It's a construct
How'd it get in my mind?
It's a door to the divine
It's a fine line in the end times

I'll be yours
You can be mine
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides
Into the color of your eyes

I'll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no superstition
United body and soul

Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

It's joy and it's union
Your sense of rhythm
How you take communion
It's a door to the divine
It's the moonlight on a landmine

I'll be yours (I'll be yours)
You can be mine (You be mine)
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides
Into the color of your eyes

I'll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no competition
United body and soul

Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

The light arrives from the past
Hits your eyes before it divides
Into colors
YOU and ME could be WE
Could be
WE

Are the light you can't see
And WE are the roots of the tree
And WE've got one life
No time for division
New vision
Be my race and religion

Race and religion (Race and religion)
Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul (Body and soul)
I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul (Body and soul)
I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul

// WE //

I wanna get wild
I wanna get free
Would you want to get off this ride with me?

I wanna get down
Get down on one knee
Would you wanna get off this ride with me?

I wanna give in
I wanna give out
Wanna give away everything in this house

I wanna get going
Before the fires burn out
You can give away everything in this house

I wanna give up
I wanna give down
Wanna give away everything in my hometown

Already know I
I wanna know we
Would you want to get off this ride with me?

When everything ends
Can we do it again?
When everything ends
Wanna do it again?
When everything ends
Can we do it again?
When everything ends
Can we do it again?
