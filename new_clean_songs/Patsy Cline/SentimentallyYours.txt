Album: SentimentallyYours

// She's Got You //

I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got your picture, she's got you

I've got the records that we used to share
And they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got the records, she's got you

I've got your memory, or has it got me
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be

I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it, dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you

I've got your memory, or has it got me
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be

I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it, dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you

// Heartaches //

Heartaches, heartaches,
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches, heartaches,
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches, for you

Heartaches, heartaches.
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches, heartaches,
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches, for you

Heartaches, heartaches,
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches
And my heart breaks
And my heart aches, for you...

// That's My Desire //

To spend one night with you
In our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you.
That's my desire!

To meet where gypsies play
Down in that dim cafe
And dance 'til break of day.
That's my desire!

We'll sip a little glass of wine,
I'll gaze into your eyes divine,
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine.

To hear you whisper low,
Just when it's time to go,
"Darling, I love you so!"
That's my desire!

We'll sip a little glass of wine,
I'll gaze into your eyes divine,
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine.

To hear you whisper low,
Just when it's time to go,
"Oh, darling, I love you so!"
That's my desire!...

// Your Cheatin' Heart //

Your cheatin' heart
Will make you weep
You'll cry and cry
And try to sleep.

But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you.

When tears come down
Like fallin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name.

You'll walk the floor
The way I do
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you.

When tears come down
Like fallin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name.

You're gonna walk the floor
The very way I do
Your cheatin' heart
Is gonna tell on you...

// Anytime //

Anytime you're feelin' lonely
Anytime you're feelin' blue
Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come on home to you

Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come on home to you
That's the time I'll come on home to you

// You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It) //

You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it.
I guess you always knew it.

You made me happy sometimes
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad.

You made me sigh for
I didn't wanna tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some lovin', that's true.
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for
You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you.

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't wanna tell you
I want some lovin', that's true.
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do.

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for
You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you...

// Strange //

Strange how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Strange you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring

Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring oh, oh, oh

Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange
How strange, how strange, how strange...

// You Belong To Me //

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me

See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

I'm gonna be so alone without you
And I'm hoping maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

// You Were Only Fooling (While I Was Falling In Love) //

You were only fooling,
But I was falling in love.

It's a story as old
As Adam and Eve,
I was making love
But you were making believe.

You lied to me with kisses,
I tried to stop dreaming of,
You were only fooling me,
While I was falling in love.

[Instrumental]

It's a story as old
As Adam and Eve,
I was making love
But you were making believe.

You lied to me with kisses,
I tried to stop dreaming of,
You were only fooling me,
While I was falling in love...

// Half As Much //

If you loved me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down

If you miss me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

If you loved me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I loved you

// I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You) //

Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And she looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

// Lonely Street //

I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called "Lonely Street?"

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called "Lonely Street?"

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called "Lonely Street?"

[Instrumental]

Where's this place called "Lonely Street?"...
