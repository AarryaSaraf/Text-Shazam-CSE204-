// That Wonderful Someone //

That wonderful Someone
Who makes the stars all shine
Who fashioned the mountains
To reach to the sky
Who brings each tomorrow
Who hears every prayer
In sunshine or sorrow
If you call He'll be there

That wonderful Someone
Who makes the flowers grow
Who paints ev'ry sunset
With colors that glow
Look all around you
And these wonders you'll see
Designed by that Someone
For you and for me

(That wonderful Someone)
(Who makes the flowers grow)
(Who paints ev'ry sunset)
(With colors that glow)
Look all around you
And these wonders you'll see
Designed by that Someone
For you and for me...

// Hungry For Love //

I'm hungry for love
Like a hobo for food
Like the devil hunts for bad
Like the angel looks for good

I've been oh, so lonesome
Your letters aren't enough
My arms will welcome you home, dear
I'm hungry for love

I've cried so many tears, dear
Sweetheart, since you've been gone
I hope that you forgive me
I'll admit that I was wrong

I won't try to change you
I miss you much to much
Darlin' please come home
I'm hungry for love

I've cried so many tears, dear
Sweetheart, since you've been gone
I hope that you forgive me
I'll admit that I was wrong

I won't try to change you
I miss you much to much
Darlin' please come home
I'm hungry for love

// Too Many Secrets //

Last night I met a woman
You'll recognize her name
Who, in our conversation
Told me you were her old flame
Well, I didn't want to listen
But as she told me more
I learned more about you
Than I'd ever known before

[Chorus:]
(You're keepin') too many secrets from me
But, baby, now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too

[Instrumental] 

Well, I walked up to a counter
To buy some cigarettes
And standin' there beside me
Was a gal I'd never met
She pulled out her wallet
And, much to my surprise
There she held your picture, baby
Right before my eyes

[Chorus:]
(You're keepin') too many secrets from me
But, baby, now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too

Too many secrets from me
But, baby, now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too

You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too...

// Don't Ever Leave Me Again //

Wake up ever' mornin'
Heart's full of pain
Looked out the window
And it's pourin' down with rain
And I cried, baby, oh baby
Don't ever leave me again

I miss your lovin'
Your kisses, too
Ain't nothin' on earth
I wouldn't do for you
And I cried, baby, oh baby
Don't ever leave me again

When rain starts fallin'
And I start callin'
Oh, baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin'
I feel like dyin'

Baby, you know
I want you so
Tell me that you're mine
'Til the end of time
And I cried, baby, oh baby
Don't ever leave me again (no)
Don't ever leave me again

When rain starts fallin'
And I start callin'
Oh, baby, how I love you
My heart is cryin'
I feel like dyin'

Baby, you know
I want you so
Tell me that you're mine
'Til the end of time
And I cried, baby, oh baby
Don't ever leave me again (no)
Don't ever leave me again

// Ain't No Wheels On This Ship //

Row, row, row
Row, row, row
I used to have big money
That was many moons ago
You use to call me honey
Now you call me so-and-so

'Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row, row, row
We can't row, row, row
We can't row
Row, row, row
Row, row, row

You used to be big, papa
The cat of every ball
Now listen, little papa
Well, I'm at your big downfall

'Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row, row, row
We can't row, row, row
We can't row
Row, row, row
Row, row, row

You use to like my lovin'
Because you liked my gold
Now ya don't want my lovin'
'Cause there ain't no dough no more

And there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row, row, row
We can't row, row, row
We can't row
Row, row, row
Row, row, row

Well, I'll tell you for the last time
And I told you this before
If you want to keep your mama
Ya gotta love me more and more

'Cause there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't row, row, row
We can't row row row
We can't row

// I Can't Forget You //

I can't forget you
I've got these memories of you
I can't forget you
I'll always be loving you

Once we were happy
We were so carefree and gay
Then something happened
And you went away

I can't forget you
Please tell me what must I do
My memories haunt me
Because I'll always love you

Where are you, darlin'?
Are you with someone new
I can't forget you
I'll always be loving you

(I can't forget you)
(I've got these memories of you)
(I can't forget you)
(I'll always be loving you)

I can't forget you
Please tell me what must I do
My memories haunt me
Because I'll always love you

Where are you, darlin'?
Are you with someone new
I can't forget you
I'll always be loving you...

// I Don't Wanna //

Don't wanna walk unless I'm walkin' with you
Don't wanna talk unless I'm talkin' to you
Don't wanna be lonesome, don't wanna be blue
Baby, that's how much I love you

Don't wanna live unless I'm livin' with you
Don't wanna give unless I'm givin' to you
Don't wanna be lonesome, don't wanna be blue
Baby, that's how much I love you

I built my whole world around you
Darlin', don't ever break my heart
I'm so glad that I found you
And in my life, you'll always play a part

Don't wanna cry unless I'm cryin' for you
Don't wanna sigh unless I'm sighin' for you
Don't wanna be found with somebody new
Baby, that's how much I love you

I built my whole world around you
Darlin', don't ever break my heart
I'm so glad that I found you
And in my life, you'll always play a part

I don't wanna cry unless I'm cryin' for you
I don't wanna sigh unless I'm sighin' for you
I don't wanna be found with somebody new
Baby, that's how much I love you.

Baby, that's how much I love you...

// Three Cigarettes In An Ashtray //

Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I, in a small cafe
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes in the ashtray

I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away

I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away

// Fingerprints //

I feel the fingerprints
That you left on my heart
You played a game of love
And then you said we had to part
You left me all alone
And as the teardrops start
I feel the fingerprints 
Of sorrow on my heart

I know you didn't mean to be unkind
And hurt me so
And you've made up your mind
But I just thought you ought to know

That when the day is thru
I think of only you
I sit alone and dream
And think of things we didn't do
Now I am all alone
And as the teardrops start
I feel the fingerprints
That you left on my heart

And when the day is thru
I think of only you
I sit alone and dream
And think of things we didn't do
Now I am all alone
And as the teardrops start
I feel the fingerprints
That you left on my heart...

// Then You'll Know //

You don't know the meaning
Of the words "I love you so"
But when you've found your one love
Then you'll know

You don't know the heartache
Or the laughter you'll forego
Until you've lost that one love
Then you'll know

Now you pretend to care for me
But, honey, if you do
Why don't you give the kind of kiss
I always give to you

So, I've just made my mind up
Even tho' my tears will flow
Go on and find your true love
Then you'll know

Now you pretend to care for me
But, honey, if you do
Why don't you give the kind of kiss
I always give to you

So, I've just made my mind up
Even tho' my tears will flow
Go on and find your true love
Then you'll know

Then You'll Know...
