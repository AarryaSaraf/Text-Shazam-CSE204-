Album: Habit

// Thinning //

Haven't felt right in a week
And I'm thinning out
And it hurts bad
I gotta get back

Hot head and dreamless sleep
I could just slip down
And on the wrong track
I gotta get back

I wanna spend the entire year
Just face down
And on my own time
I wanna waste mine

And spend the rest of it asking myself
"Is this who you are?"
And I don't know
It just feels gross

I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong
And I don't think there's anything wrong
I don't think there's anything wrong

Sunlight on the back of my arms
Just thins me out
To a different time
I wanna waste mine

// Habit //

Had a dream it was on my ceiling
I had a feeling it was in my head
If I walk outside every time it's freezing
I have to wonder if it wants me dead again

It's not something I can run my hands over

I'm not afraid to walk without a way
If I close my eyes I'm scared I'll never get to leave the grey
I wanna sleep and never leave my bed
And then I won't hesitate to call it my friend again

It's not something I can run my hands over

Oh, never sleep again

// Static Buzz //

Shutters on my house
Keep the sunlight in
If that's not enough to keep the people out

Then I don't wanna know what's on the other side

Turn on the TV
I wonder who thinks of it all
We could be watching the same thing

But I always shock myself when I plug it into the wall

So should I ask?
Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

Cover me in flies
They're breaking through the door
That'll show the garbage man
What everyone else is always so bitter for

So should I ask?
Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

// Dirt //

I've been down countless halls
And once you've seen one it's like you've seen 'em all
And I've seen two open doors
And I can't help but wonder what the second is for

I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
Even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt
The dirt

There's a weight and I feel it and it's pressing down
And it won't be for nothing and it won't stick around
If it is about anything that I can fix
Then I'll see you on the other side if it really exists

I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
Even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt
The dirt

No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough
No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough

Let's forget it now
Baby when I'm 30 I'll laugh about how dumb it felt
Baby when I'm 30 I'll laugh it out
And oh god it's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny
But I know we can laugh it out

// Slug //

Oh garden slug
What would you give to live like one of us?
Or would you rather wait in the shade?
Just the same as everyday

Oh useless thing
What does another useless day bring?
Did you just lie in place?
Emulated by the way I lie awake

And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

And oh is it easiest to hide?
Under covered rocks
Or would you rather cut it all down?
Just to keep it from dragging you around

And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him
Because there's nothing and there won't ever be
And in moss covered springs you'll never find anything
So what's the use in hiding under our feet?
