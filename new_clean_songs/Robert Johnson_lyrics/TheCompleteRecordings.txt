// Kind Hearted Woman Blues //

I got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women
Man, they will not let me be
I love my baby
My baby don't love me
I love my baby, oooh
My baby don't love me
But I really love that woman
Can't stand to leave her be

A-ain't but the one thing
Makes  Mister Johnson drink
I's worried 'bout how you treat me, baby
I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart
When you call Mister So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You well's to kill me
As to have it on your mind

When you call me Mister So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You wells to kill me, baby

'Cause I just ain't satisfied

// When You Got A Good Friend //

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right

I mistreated my baby, and I can't see no reason why
I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why
Everytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry

Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
Would she sympathize with me
She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be

Babe, I may be right ay wrong
Baby it's yo'y opinion, oh, I may be right ay wrong
Watch your close friend, baby, then your ene'ies can't do no harm

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right

I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why
Everytime I thinks about it, I just wring my hands and cry

Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
Or would she sympathize with me
She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be

I love my baby, but I can't make that ag'ee
I love that woman, but what can we can't agree
I really love that woman, nnn, wonder why we can't agree

It's your opinion, friend-girl, I may be right or wrong
It's yo'y opinion friend-girl, I may be right or wrong
But when you watch your close friend, baby
Then your enemies can't do you no harm

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right

// Come On In My Kitchen //

You better come on in my kitchen

Some joker got lucky stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Oh-ah, she's gone 
I know she won't come back

Oh, can't you hear that wind howl? 
Oh-y', can't you hear that wind would howl?
You better come on in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

When a woman gets in trouble everybody throws her down
Lookin' for her good friend none can be found
You better come on in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

(spoken: Mama, can't you hear that wind howl?
Oh how the wind do howl!)
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Nnn, the woman that I love, I crave to see
She's up the country, won't write to me
Then, you better come on in my kitchen, goin' to be rainin' outdoors

I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman, lonesome blues got me
But she better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

My mamma dead, papa well's1 to be, ain't got nobody to love and care for me
She better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

But I'm cryin', pleease, pleease don't do me wrong.
Who been drivin' my Terraplane1 now for, you since I been gone.

Mr. highway man, please don't block the road
Puh hee hee, please don't block the road
'Cause she's reachin' a cold one hundred and I'm booked and I got to go

Yoo... you hear me weep and moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane1 now for, you since I been gone

I'm gon' get down in this connection, keep on tanglin' with your wires
I'm gon' get down in this connection, oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires
And when I mash down on your little starter, then your spark plug will give me fire
