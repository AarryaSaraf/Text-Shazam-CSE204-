Album: TellMeHowYouReallyFeel

// Hopefulessness //

You know what they say
No one is born to hate
We learn it somewhere along the way
Take your broken heart
Turn it into art
Can't take it with you
Can't take it with you

I don't wanna
I don't wanna know

Empty bottle blues
Sleep in different rooms
Hardly a maverick, lesser than average
Your vulnerability
Stronger than it seems
You know it's okay to have a bad day

I don't wanna
I don't wanna know

Just get this one done
Then you can move along
Can't take it with you
Can't take it with you
You know what they say
No one is born to hate
I'm getting louder now
I'm getting louder now

// City Looks Pretty //

The city looks pretty when you been indoors
For 23 days I've ignored all your phone calls
Everyone's waiting when you get back home
They don't know where you been, why you gone so long
Friends treat you like a stranger and
Strangers treat you like their best friend, oh well
Spare a thought for the ones that came before
All in a daze bending backwards to reach your goal

Sometimes I get sad
It's not all that bad
One day, maybe never
I'll come around

The city takes pity on your injured soul
And heavenly prose ain't enough good to fill that hole
Everyone's soaked in animosity
It's vicious in winter, you never say what you mean
Friends treat you like a stranger and
Strangers treat you like their best friend, oh well
Wakin' up to another dismal day
You got a ways to go, you oughta be grateful

Sometimes I get mad
It's not half as bad
Pull yourself together
And just calm down

I'll be what you want oh when you want it
But I'll never be what you need
And the city looks pretty from where I'm standing...

// Charity //

At the end of every season I'm spent up
Keep thinking this will be the one
Hesitation lingers to all my reason
As if you care, I know you got your own stuff
Going on

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

Can we talk about it once we've slept
And when can we, yeah, can we work it out?
Meditation just makes you more strung out
I wish you had a guru who told to let it go
To let it go

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

You don't have to pretend you're not scared
Everyone else is just as terrified as you
Medication just makes you more upset
I bet you got a lot to prove
I know you're still the same
Still the same

You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?
You must be having so much fun
Everything's amazing
You're so subservient I make myself sick
Are you listening?

// Need A Little Time //

I don't know a lot about you but
You seem to know a lot about me so
I take a little time out
I take a little time out

I'm sorry that I lost my patience
You deserve better, it's true
I need a little time out
I need a little time out
From me, me, me, me...
And you, oooh, you, oooh...

Open up your insides, show us
Your inner most lecherous
I'll rip it out carefully
I promise you won't feel a thing

Everybody wants to have their say
Forever waiting for some car crash
I need a little time out
I need a little time out
From me, me, me, me...
And you, oooh, you, oooh...

Shave your head to see how it feels
Emotionally it's not that different
But to the hand it's beautiful
Yeah to the hand it's beautiful

You seem to have the weight of the world
Upon your bony shoulders well hold on
You need a little time out
You need a little time out
From you, you, you, you...
And me, me, me, me...
Me, me, me, me...

// Nameless, Faceless //

Don't you have anything better to do
I wish that someone could hug you
Must be lonely
Being angry
Feeling over-looked
You sit alone at home in the darkness
With all the pent-up rage that you harness
I'm real sorry
Bout whatever happened to you

I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them
I hold my keys
Between my fingers

He said "I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup
And spit out better words than you"
But you didn't
Man, you're kidding yourself if you think
The world revolves around you
You know you got lots to give
And so many options
I'm real sorry
Bout whatever happened to you

I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Men are scared that women will laugh at them
I wanna walk through the park in the dark
Women are scared that men will kill them

I hold my keys
Between my fingers
Go on, tell me
You're just kidding
He said, she said
Nameless, faceless

// I'm Not Your Mother, I'm Not Your Bitch //

I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
I hear you mutter under your breath
Put up or shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes

I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
D-did I stutter a little bit?
Sit down and shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes

I get myself defensive
When I know I'm wrong
Think we all can agree
I try my best at being patient
But I can't only put up with so much shit

I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
I hear you mutter under your breath
Put up or shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes

// Crippling Self Doubt And A General Lack Of Self Confidence //

Yes, they say whoever pays
The piper calls the tune
Oh, let's avoid the truth
Make you all feel special
And your desperation stinks
I can smell it on your breath
A certain absolute anosmic
Got yourself to blame for this

(Tell me how you really feel)
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything

Your opinion means a lot
Well, tell me what's the use
I never feel as stupid as when I'm around you
And indecision rots
Like a bag of last week's meat
And I guess it's hard to keep everybody happy

(Tell me how you really feel)
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything

I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything
I don't know, I don't know anything

// Help Your Self //

Darkness depends on where you're standing
Jump the creek and watch the sunshine swim
You found it in a place in the end of northeast
Gotta a momentary bend
Give me dreams, upstream, low and screaming

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation

You catch the moon so carefully
Breath out, breath in
This target forgets patience
Pull back and release
The sign on the shelf says:
"Please help your self"

Won't you tell me something new?
You're in tune with who surrounds you

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation
You gotta learn your mind
You know they're half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation
You gotta learn your mind
You know they're half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you

// Walkin' On Eggshells //

One, two, three, four

Before we get started it I'll clean this up
No use drinking from a leaking cup
You know what I mean?
Not really, it seems
And when we get going, we'll keep it saying
Changes as good as a holiday
I'm not claiming I'm some patron saint

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away

Walkin' on eggshells gets tiring and
Pulling teeth, white-knuckling
And I don't wanna hurt your feelings
So I say nothing
A sort of self-righteous, my heart of gold
Just sit back, do what you're told
If you spot it, you got it
Well, maybe I got it too

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away

And it goes
And it goes
Yeah, it goes away
Say what you need to...

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away
Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what you got you throw it all away

// Sunday Roast //

Don't come with your arms swinging
Throw them around me
Some kind of sweet relief
I hope you never leave

It's all the same to me
Just bring yourself
You know your presence is present enough
I got a front row seat
It's all the same to me
I spend a lot of my time
Doing a whole lot of nothing

I know you're doing your best
I think you're doing just fine

I know it's been a long week
And now you're taking your time
Some kindness goes around
Some kind of backfires

It's all the same to me
Ignore that voice
It puts you down
You make your choice, I'm here for you
It's all the same to me
I got a lot on my mind
But I don't know how to say it

I know you're doing your best
I think you're doing just fine

Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
'Cause if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
And if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
Keep on keeping on
You know you're not alone
And I know all your stories
But I'll listen to them again
And if you move away
You know I'll miss your face
It's all the same to me
You know it's all the same to me
