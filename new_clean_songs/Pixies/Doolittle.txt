// Tame //

got hips like cinderella

must be having a good shame

talking sweet about nothing

cookie i think you're 

tame


i'm making good friends with you

when you're shaking your good frame

fall on your face in those bad shoes

lying there like you're tame


uh huh huh


tame

// Wave Of Mutilation //

cease to resist, giving my goodbye

drive my car into the ocean

you'll think i'm dead, but i sail away

on a wave of mutilation

a wave

wave


i've kissed mermaids, rode the el nino

walked the sand with the crustaceans

could find my way to mariana

on a wave of mutilation,

wave of mutilation

wave of mutilation

wave


wave of mutilation

wave

// I Bleed //

as loud as hell

a ringing bell

behind my smile

it shakes my teeth

and all the while

as vampires feed

i bleed


prithee, my dear,

why are we here

nobody knows 

we go to sleep

as breathing flows

my mind secedes

i bleed


there's a place

in the buried west

in a cave

with a house in it

in the clay

the holes of hands

you can place 

a hand in hand

in bleed

// Here Comes Your Man //

Outside there's a box car waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait 'til face turns blue

I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man [4x]

Big shake on the box car moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man [4x]

There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man [13x]

// Dead //

tan belly

uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

// Monkey Gone To Heaven //

There was a guy
An underwater guy who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge
From New York and New Jersey

This monkey's gone to Heaven [x4]

The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole
Now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold
Everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns
I'll get mine, too

This monkey's gone to Heaven [x4]

Rock me Joe!

If man is 5 [x3]

Then the devil is 6 [x5]

Then God is 7 [x3]

This monkey's gone to Heaven [x9]

// Number 13 Baby //

that flows to her bones

and a comb in her pocket 

if the winds get blown

stripes on her eyes when she walks slow

black tear falling on my lazy queen

choir in the yard

in the house next door

where a grandma brought

some songs from the shore

six foot girl gonna

sweat when she dig

stand close to the fire

when they light the pig

standing in her chinos shirt pulled off clean

gotta tattooed tit say number 13


viva 

don't want no blue eyes

la loma

i want brown eyes

rica

Been trying to meet you
Hey

Or whores in my head
Whores at the door

And the whores like a choir
Go uh all night
And Mary ain't you tired of this?
Uh

The
Sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks

We're chained

// Gouge Away //

gouge away

you can gouge away

stay all day 

if you want to


missy aggravation

some sacred questions

you stroke my locks

some marijuana

if you got some


gouge away 

you can gouge away

stay all day

if you want to


sleeping on your belly

you break my arms

you spoon my eyes

been rubbing a bad charm

with holy fingers


gouge away

you can gouge away

stay all day

if you want to


chained to the pillars

a 3-day party

i break the walls

and kill us all

with holy fingers


gouge away

you can gouge away

stay all day

if you want to

// Silver //

in this land of strangers

there are dangers

there are sorrows

i can't see this lady

it is shady

i am leaving tomorrow

tomorrow

tomorrow


even there's a reason

it's silver

it's gone

in this land of strangers

there are dangers

there are sorrows

sorrows 

sorrows

sorrows
