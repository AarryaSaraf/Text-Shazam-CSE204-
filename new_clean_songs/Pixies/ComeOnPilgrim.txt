// Caribou //

I live cement

I hate this street

Give dirt to me

I bite lament

This human form

Where I was born

I now repent


Caribou  [3x]


Repent

Re-pe-ent


Give me white

Ground to run

And foregone

Lets me knife

Knife me lets

I will get

What I like


Caribou  [3x]


Repent

Rep-pent

Our own animal sings for free for the people,

Hey babe what are we doing here?

Laaa Loooh,Fatherland.


Island of the enchantment,

I'm leaving!

// Ed Is Dead //

Her head is in a bitter way

Her brain's on fire

She's just looking for the perfect wave

It's her brain's desire

I'll think of her when I walk the strand

On this true Hermosa night


Ed is dead  [4x]


She's just rotting in stupid bliss

With music on her bars uh

Her face burning in the L.A. sun

She got no got no fear of cars

I better kick my strand cruiser

To the friendlier oh oh oh oh oh oh


Ed is dead  [4x]


Ed is dead

Ed is, yeah Ed is

Ed is dead  [3x]

E.I.D.  [3x]


No, no, no, no, no

// The Holiday Song //

Well sit right down my wicked son

And let me tell you a story

About the boy who fell from glory

And how he was a wicked son


This ain't no holiday

But it always turns out this way

Here I am with my hand


He took his sister from his head

And then painted her on the sheets

And then rolled her up in grass and trees

And they kissed 'till they were dead


This ain't no holiday

But it always turns out this way

Here I am, with my hand


Well sit right down my evil son

And let me tell you a story

About the boy who fell from glory

And how he was a wicked son


This ain't no holiday

But it always turns out this way

Here I am, with my hand


This ain't no holiday

But it always turns out this way

Here I am, with my hand

// Nimrod's Son //

One night upon my motorcycle through the desert spead

And smashed my body so that all my friends thought I was dead

My sister held me close and whispered to my bleeding head

"You are the son of a mother fucker"


One two three four


I shook all night and held her hand

Chocolate people well I'll be damned

Land of plenty, land of fun

To find out I'm Nimrod's son


Oh bury me

Far away please

Bury me


Ha-haaa

The joke has come upon me


In my motorcycle mirror I think about the life I've led

And how my soul's been aking all the holes where I have bled

My image spoke to me, yes to me and often said

"You are the son of incestuous union"


One two three


Now my head is clear

My luke hands washed

My daughter's pure

My son is tall

Land of plenty, land of fun

To find out I'm Nimrod's son


Oh bury me

Far away please

Bury me


Ha-ha Ha-ha

The joke has come upon me

// I've Been Tired //

One two three

She's a real left winger 'cause she been down south

And held peasants in her arms

She said "I could tell you a story that could make you cry"

"What about you?"

I said "Me too"

"I could tell you a story that will make you cry"

And she sighed "Ah"

I said "I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed"

"I like Lou Reed" she said sticking her tongue in my ear

"Let's go, let's sit, let's talk"

"Politics go so good with beer"

"And while we're at it baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?"

I said "Loosing my penis to a whore with disease"

"Just kidding" I said

"Losing my life to a whore with disease"

She said "Excuse me please?"

I said "Losing my life to a whore with disease"

I said "Please... I'm a humble guy with a healthy desire"

"Don't give me no shit because..."


I've been tired  [6x]


I tell a tale of a girl, but I call her a woman

She's a little bit older than me

Strong legs, strong face, voice like milk, breasts like a cluster of grapes

I can't escape the ways she raise me

She'll make you feel like Solomon be one of your babies even if you had no one

(And while we're at it baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?)

Took my sleep after setting my loins on fire

But that's OK because...


I've been tired  [6x]


I've been tired  [9x]

T-i-r-e-d spells it

Spells it
