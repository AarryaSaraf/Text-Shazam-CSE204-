// I Don't Want You //

What's going to happen to me, when I leave here?
To go, somewhere else

That's far enough, did it make you leave?
That's long enough, did it make you stay?
That's long enough, did it make you leave?
Thats' far enough, did it make you leave?

He didn't take you to me
He didn't want me to leave
He didn't take you to me
He didn't want me to leave now

What's going to happen to me, when I leave here?
To go, somewhere else

He didn't take you to me
He didn't want me to leave
He didn't take you to me
He didn't want me to leave now

I don't want you
I don't want you
I don't want you
I don't want you

// I Am Afraid Of Literally Everything //

I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything

I can't make friends
I can't get a job
I can't shake hands
I can't go out

I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything

I can't play guitar
I can't sing loudly
I can't write words, that mean anything to me

I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally anything

// 100 Minutes Of Solitude //

Was that a thing when we met last time
Was that me asking when we met this time
Would you mind all that's happening to come back again

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be [?]

You have a thing or two about you
Did you know a thing or two about me
Would you know I forgotten everything again

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be [?]

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be [?]

// Neon Sign //

I was blind at the start, my sunglasses were far too dark
I was a danger to myself and to pedestrians
But lo' I did blink, at the sign that gave a wink
And told me that this establishment was open for business

It was a neon sign, that confused my eyes
And the disconnected lines, that were arranged in the letter 'i'

Walked up the window, and pressed it against my nose
And held hands with the people to my left and white
Black or white there was no, difference in that neon glow
And we told the world this establishment was open for business

Yes that neon sign, that opened my eyes
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'
Saw the neon sign, that disturbed my eyes
And my disconnected mind, told me everything was fine

And I voiced my sighs, to the neon sky
And the Lord came down in a glowing light
And the glowing light was the neon sign, that destroyed my eye
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'
Paint the neon sign, that destroyed mankind
Cus' the voltage was too high, and the colors were too bright
For our disintegrated hands, that looked to the sign and read
And found out what looked as if, and it said
O-P-E-N

// Samson's Golden Axe //

Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong

No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you

[reversed:]
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong
Something went wrong and then something else went wrong

No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you
No man loves you, no man loves you

// I Scream Social //

Hard to sleep when you're not alone
Hard to talk when you're on the phone
I can't laugh when you say something
That is not funny, I mean I guess I'm sorry
It's okay, I know you're trying hard
It isn't working out, why don't we try again
At a later time

Awkward jokes
(Awkward jokes)
Won't help me get to know you
But it's the only
(But it's the only)
Way we can communicate, break the ice open

I don't like people I don't know
I shaved my eyebrows a bit too much
It's not that I don't like to talk to people at all
I just don't know where to start, or how can I jump in
To this conversation

"Don't be shy"
(Don't be shy)
Is not genuine encouragement
Hard-earned trust
(Hard-earned trust)
That is what I'm looking for, not an ice cream social
(And a ropes course)

// Wachovia Receipts //

I never told my mom-

Does it make you with the Anti-Christ when it does sexual fantasies you have are Christmas theme-

From car door, using a Wachovia receipt which might or might-

One night, my only lover sees me, she involuntarily grits her teeth
And then my own father beats me
In a game of Monopoly

It looks like your eyes are broke in half, only seeing north-

What are you listening to?
That's a good song

Running through his "baby", you know in his head, he sees a "b a y hyphen b e e"

Running through his "baby", you know in his head, he sees a "b a y hyphen b-"

I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it

// The Singles Song //

Well I shaved my pubic hair off
There was no one to stop me (Ow!)
I shaved my pubic hair off
There was no one to stop me

Nutri-Grain, and surge protectors
For general purpose, Oh
Nutri-Grain, and surge protectors
For general purpose, Uh

I shaved my pubic hair off
There was no one to stop me (Stop me)
I shaved my pubic hair off
(I shaved my pubic hair off)
There was no one to stop me
(There was no one to stop me)

// Squid Desert //

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

I don't really want to see you anymore, you now took it all away
I don't really want to see you anymore, you now took it all away

This is an outrage, I, cannot explain it

// Ff //

Fangface, I wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk
Fangface, really wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk

And I went to a show, just to get out of my head
And I didn't talk to anyone at all
And I went to a show, just to stop thinking of you
And I didn't talk to anyone at all

Fangface, did you not notice?
All the quiet obscure things
That I've been dropping for the past seventeen years
Fangface, I really love you but
Fangface, you just wanna eat me
And that is not such a healthy relationship
And speaking of love, honey I'm sick of this

I got startled
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
And it's all gone, it's all
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

And I thought I saw a star, but it was just a plane
And I thought I saw the moon, but it was just you
And I thought I saw a star, but it was just a plane
And I thought I saw the moon, but it was just you

Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk
Fangface, I should really learn how to talk

(Stop it, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.)

// Nothing //

It's one of your best
An empty studio
I've got a prepared statement that I'm prepared to make

This all was for nothing
This all was for nothing
This all was for nothing
This all was for nothing

It's one of your best
An empty studio
I've got a prepared statement that I'm prepared to make

It's one of your best
An empty studio
I've got a prepared statement that I'm prepared to make

This all was for nothing
This all was for nothing
This all was for nothing

Attractive like a pomegranate
Attractive like a pomegranate
Attractive like a pomegranate
Attractive like a pomegranate

// Surf Jerk //

Surfing is like jerking off
You've gotta wait for the perfect one
Surfing is like jerking off
You've gotta wait for the perfect one

I got my wax and board
Swear to God I'll never get bored
Looking for the perfect wave
And another wave
And another wave

// A Pleasant Sort Of Terror //

It was as if the two of them, had taken a third
A little girl, swimming to the cold English sea
With a little girl held between
Had taken her out deep, beneath, the grey English sky

It was as if the two of them, had taken a third
A little girl, swimming through the cold English sea
With a little girl held between them
Had taken her out deep, beneath, the grey English sky

I was found far enough out into the sea
They let her go and they watched her
Here's some cash an camera
I took some expanded photographs of the drowning

I was found far enough out into the sea
They let her go and they watched her
(I was found far enough out into the sea
They let her go and they watched her)

Expanded photographs of, expanded photographs of

Here's some cash, here's some cash
Here's some cash, here's some cash
(Far enough, far enough, far enough, far)
(The sea, the sea, the sea, the sea)
Expanded photographs of, expanded photographs of

Here's some cash, here's some cash

Expanded photographs of, expanded photographs of

// The Staying Song //

I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
I want to close my head in something heavy with a locking mechanism
It's just bad timing, I only moved here two weeks ago
And the rent was so expensive, my parents would kill me if I left

I dropped every pick I have on the floor
It'll take me so long to pick them up
And I don't have the strength to put on my clothes
And I don't have the strength to open the blinds

I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
Don't unplug the alarm clock until I'm done with this
I want to put duct tape in sensitive areas and rip it off
And a buzzsaw to divide perpendicular sections of my brain

I hate the fluorescent light so I'm sitting here in the dark
And I don't have the strength to go to a restaurant
And I don't have the strength to pour a bowl of cereal
I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
...

// I Can Talk With My Eyes Shut //

I think you could be beautiful
I wouldn't love you if you were
Eyes the size of light bulbs
Irises sharpie dots

Sometimes I think you're beautiful
I don't love you when you are
Every other day like this
Alone on the bedroom floor

Let's stare each other in the face
Don't tell me we are not in space
The rags we started out with
The rags we ended up with
I'll text you walking on your legs
I'll need to see you when I'm dead
I said you know that when we kiss
It's never on the lips so

You can talk
You can talk
You can talk!
You can talk!

Sometimes a cigarette, is just a phallic symbol
I've come up sporting half a haircut, that scissors couldn't fix
And sometimes a cigarette, is just a good way to die
My legs around your back, I just needed words to sing

Never look me in the eye
Cause yours see so much more than mine
The rags with which we started out
The rags with which we ended up
You walk with spine curved backwards
I'd like to be your actor
I can't get to sleep until I know
For sure that you've moved on

You can talk
You can talk
You can talk!
You can talk!
You can talk!
You can talk!

// The Vice President Of Google And Et Al //

I have not even bothered to call
[?]
Take any pictures of me

It doesn't mean
Anything to me

I just want to go home
And get paid

Breathe with me
Or else everything will go away
With me
Take me to the parking lot and
Breathe with me
Or else everything will go away
With me
Take me to the parking lot and

It doesn't mean
Anything to me

I just want to go home
And get paid

It doesn't mean
Anything to me

I just want to go home
