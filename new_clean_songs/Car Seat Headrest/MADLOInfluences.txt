// Golden Years //

Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

// Substitute //

You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young but I'm just back-dated... yeah

(Substitute) Your lies for fact
(Substitute) I see right through your plastic Mac
(Substitute) I look all white but my dad was black
(Substitute) My fine-looking suit's really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all, just pass it by... pass it by

(Substitute) Me for him
(Substitute) My coke for gin
(Substitute) You for my mum
(Substitute) At least I'll get my washin' done

// March Of The Pigs //

Step right up!
March!
Push!
Crawl right up on your knees!

Please!
Greed!
Feed!

I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I wanna watch it come down

Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I wanna watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

Shove it up inside
Surprise!
Lies
Stains like blood on your teeth
Bite
Chew
Suck

I wanna break it up
I wanna smash it up
I wanna fuck it up
I wanna watch it come down

Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I wanna watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

The pigs have won tonight
And they can all sleep soundly
And everything is alright

// Running Up That Hill //

It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?

It's you
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Said if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
There is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me we both matter, don't we?

It's you
It's you and me
It's you and me and we won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Said if I only could, oh

It's you
It's you and me
It's you and me and we won't be unhappy

C'mon baby, c'mon darlin'
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

Said if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
With no problem

Said if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
