Album: TallyAllTheThingsThatYouBroke

// You've Got Me Wonderin' Now //

Cavity click keeps the rhythm, keeps it movin'
Any day it's gonna crack
Popcorn kernel, olive pit, at any moment smashed to bits (yeah)

Toothache's better than heartache baby
I've figured that much out
And I thought I knew a thing or two about the blues
But you've got me wonderin' now

Dog-eyed kindess (naïve and trusting)
Fans the purest flame of morning fire
But once it fizzles out into charred, formless evening
How do you ignite without turning to ash (yeah)

Seasick's better than heartsick, baby
I know that much by now
And I thought I knew nausea from sea to cars

But you've got me wondering' now
But you've got me wondering' now
But you've got me wondering' now
But you've got me wondering' now

Forced into morning, tempted into night
Tally all the things that you broke
Bending her branches, snapping, sapping and writhing
For me alone

Yeah, I guess sunburn's better than heartburn (barely)
I know that much by now
And I thought I knew a thing or two about the blues

But you've got me wonderin' now
But you've got me wonderin' now
But you've got me wonderin' now
But you've got me wonderin' now

// Descend (The Way) //

Traveled boots, they fit right
Leather creased by steps since I lose squalor
Aged like wine but still there's a hum
Climbing midway up the map
Other pavement, dress school slacks
Sneers remind me here that still there's a hum

Turn it over, pour out the cup
You see the bottom, you've got enough
Descend, descend, it's the way

Like copper in a coffee tin
Worthless though in palaces
Water plus vitamins and still there's a hum
Edit clear of webs and vines
Real ambition can't be defined
Cliché but, never mind, still there's a hum

Turn it over, pour out the cup
You see the bottom, you've got enough
Descend, descend, descend, descend, it's the way

Turn it over, pour out the cup
You see the bottom, you've got enough
Descend, descend, descend, descend
Descend, descend, descend, descend
Descend, descend

// The More It Works //

Express yourself without the tools that they give you
Want something they didn't tell you to want
Say something without the words that they fed you
Find something they didn't tell you to hunt for

Because
The more you use it, the more it works [x8]

Be yourself and not the figure they mould
Look for something they've been trying to hide
Do something you were never told to
Don't keep it to yourself, don't keep it inside

Yeah
The more you use it, the more it works [x4]
The more you flex it, the more it grows
The more you feed it, the less it owes
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Yeah
The more you use it, the more it works [x4]
The more you flex it, the more it grows
The more you feed it, the less it owes
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Yeah
The more it works [x6]

Yeah listen up, listen up everybody
What could I even mean?
Could it be your teeth, could it be your eyes
Could it be your mouth, could it be your spleen

It's kind of like all those things
It's kind of wrapped into one
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Define yourself, not in title
Embrace a concept not taught in school
The more you use it, the more it works
If you waste it, you're a fool

Yeah
The more it works [x40]

// Fall On Yr Face //

Well, did you hear his headphones when the needle floated over Caverns of Sonora's grooves?
Old thesaurus, I can do that better
With incentive removed, if we reach extensions of optimus arms crushing on urban decay
It was an honor but not a pleasure
How it feels to fall on your face

Maxwell, he says "make it weird"
What do you think now that you hear?
Johnny, bring that back, that's not what I had in mind
Let's get to Mexico, did I sell my soul?
Well, I bet you saw a celebrity in its place
If so, Johnny, press erase!
No! Hey! Don't! No!
How it feels to fall on my face

// He's Seeing Paths //

He's got a MetroPCS and a bike and an alibi
Chinatown, downtown, to Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy
Green paths, grey paths, one way streets
Running through the grid trying to get to point B
Chinese food drivers taking wrong way rides
Driver side doors trying not to collide
Nothing in his mind but a five borough map
Left, right, north, south, east, west, he's seeing paths

He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths

His eyes going side to side, scanning for the haters
Suspicious doorman pointing at the elevator
Later, he's sitting in the park and thinking
Then he hits the ground running when the burner starts beeping
So [?] and the train [?]
First goes up, the second goes down
James on Broome went six for five
And Mike in Union Square got three
Jimmy on Sixty-Ninth got one
Pablo wasn't home, so he got none
Like the boys in the park making [?]
Like a rook through the board he's seeing paths

He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths

At the Wilson Ave checkpoint, he's got to trust his instincts
And slips into the hands of the 83rd Precinct
"Don't touch my bag," he pleads, "Mr. Officer
Nothing in there but clothes and fabric softener"
Yeah they're perched outside every corner store
Cause the powers that be choose to surveil the poor
Avoiding eye contact every time he goes past
[?] to the gut of the beast, he's seeing paths

He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
He's seeing paths
