Album: ToBeKind

// Screen Shot //

Love, child, reach, rise
Sight, blind, steal, light
Mind, scar, clear, fire
Clean, right, pure, kind
Sun, come, sky, tar
Mouth, sand, teeth, tongue
Cut, push, reach, inside
Feed, breathe, touch, come

No pain, no death, no fear, no hate
No time, no now, no suffering
No touch, no loss, no hand, no sense
No wound, no waste, no lust, no fear
No mind, no greed, no suffering
No thought, no hurt, no hands to reach
No knife, no words, no lie, no cure
No need, no hate, no will, no speech
No dream, no sleep, no suffering
No pain, no now, no time, no hear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear

Love! Now!
Breathe! Now!
Here! Now!
Here! Now!
Here! Now!

// Just A Little Boy (For Chester Burnett) //

Now I sleep in the belly of woman
And I sleep in the belly of man
And I sleep in the belly of rhythm
And I sleep in the belly of love
I sleep in the belly of oceans
I sleep in the belly of truth
I sleep in the belly of kindness
And I sleep in the belly of you

I'm just a little boy
I'm just a little boy
I'm not human
I'm not human
I need love!
I need love!

// A Little God In My Hands //

Pink little lamb, on a granite slab
Black chasm creeping, forever leaking
Oh universe: Sing in reverse
Oh sucking lung: We'll never come
Forever loving! Forever waiting!
Oh yeah! 
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!

Eye full of sun, hand full of mud
Oh universe: you stink of love!
Forever lazy, forever crazy
Forever holy, forever hungry
Forever hateful, forever beautiful
Forever needing, forever reaching
Forever stinking, forever breathing
Forever growing, forever leaving

Oh shit and blood! Forever love!
No ebb or flood, will ever come!
Oh shit and blood! Forever love, love, love!
Forever draining, forever leaving
What's my name? 
What's my name?
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!

// Some Things We Do //

We seed, we feel, we need, we fight
We seal, we cut, we seek, we love
We grow, we take, we eat, we break
We hunt, we hurt, we seize, we kneel
We heal, we fuck, we pray, we hate
We reach, we touch, we lose, we taste
We learn, we lie, we wound, we waste
We hold, we kill, we love, we veil
We crawl, we seek, we fail, we rage
We fuck, we come, we love, we work
We search, we share, we wound, we keep
We blind, we take, we hide, we hold
We breathe, we steal, we bind, we build
We seed, we fuck, we rage, we weep
We betray, we serve, we regret, we learn
With tooth, and claw, we touch, we teach
We fuck, we love, we forget, we regret
We love, we love, we love, we love
We fuck, we love, we love, we love

// She Loves Us! //

I am no thing
I am no one
Come to my mouth
Come to my tongue
I am your girl
I am your son
Come to my house
Come to my lung
Come to my house
Come to my mouth
Come to my tongue
Fun fun fun!
I am your girl
I am your son
Come to my mouth
Come to my lung
Fun fun fun!
Mau mau mau
Fuck fuck fuck!
Your name is fuck!
I'm going home! I'm going home!
Halleluiah! Halleluiah!

// Kirsten Supine //

May moonlight fall upon your breast
May god send wind to lick your lips
The river flows beneath your comb
Granite, pines -silver shine, green velvet throne
Folding in, folding in, the watern sings the black horse scream
May planets crash, may god rain ash, to sear our skin, to fold us in
Kneeling close, seeking hands, our blood is warm, but what comes next!

I will let it go, I can't let it go
I won't let it go, I can let it go

// Oxygen //

Oxygen: Amen! Oxygen: Amen!
I can breathe again. I can breathe again.
Oxygen -come in! Oxygen -come in!
Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen!
Black oil smoke
Thick blue sky
Dead red eye
Hear me cry
Eat my throat
Feed my mind
Yellow eye: Feel me cry
Take me now
Peel my skin
Scrape my vein
Seal me in
Break my bones
Dance and spin
Cut a hole
Feed me now!

I'll steal all the oxygen!

Hey there Dog Man, now I drink from your bowl
Hey there Mr Skull, I'm not scared of your cull
Oxygen! Amen! Oxygen! Amen!
Breathe in! Breathe in!

// Nathalie Neal //

Hey hey hey Nathalie
Hey hey hey Nathalie
Love is strong, Love is long
Live forever in this song - Nathalie!
Kill the cruel, heal the blind
Cut your name onto the sky - Nathalie!

Hey hey hey Nathalie
Hey hey hey Nathalie
Scatter joy, Steal the light
Dance upon a useless lie - Nathalie!
Love is strong, hate is gone
Live forever in this song - Nathalie!

// To Be Kind //

To be kind, to be kind
To be real, to be new
To be sung by a song that's untrue
The falling sun, the fallen one
In a bed, painted blue, touching you
Listening, just listening
To the rain, to the wind, in the field
To be kind, to be kind
To be lost, in a bed, touching you
To be lost, to be lost
To be found in the sound of this room

"There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes..."
