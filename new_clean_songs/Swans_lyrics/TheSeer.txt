Album: TheSeer

// Lunacy //

In the mind 
of no one
Forming sun
Forming love
Break the chain
Hide within
Innocence
Not innocent
Innocent
In no sense
Eat the beast
Keep him in
Take the blame
Speak the name

LUNACY

Hide beneath
Your monkey skin
Feel his love
Nurture him
Kill the truth
Or speak the name

LUNACY

Your childhood is over (is over)

// Mother Of The World //

In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again

And where are you now
O Mother of the world

Ah we feed from your hands
and we drink from your filth and your oil

So send them down 
to scrape and suck the soil

Keep us safe inside
your damp and rusty coil

In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again

Mother sun
Mother of senseless things

Mother come
Kill time as it begins

// The Wolf //

Now feed me through
The power line

Wash me in
Your bloodless light

To be splayed upon
Your silver gate

I am proud in flesh
I am bruised but I am raised

// The Seer //

I see it all
...

// The Seer Returns //

Behind the veil of silver scars, there is a special inverted star
He's a greasy beast, heaving in a field of sticky black mud

I'm down here naked
There's a hole in my chest
Both my arms are broken
Pointing east and west

Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your light pours into my mouth
Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your life pours into my mouth

There's a jagged deep crack in the crust of the earth, spreading from north to south

Put your light in my mouth

Ahh the mountains are crumbling
Ahh the canyons are thundering
All the people are fucking
They're just a pile of writhing selfish bliss

I know I'll never die. I scream up at the sky:

You have arrived

Hey
Bring the children home

// The Daughter Brings The Water //

In the screen
In the screen
The daughter in white water

In the screen
But not seen
Her hand describes the father

Stilted bones
Cloaked in foam
Squeeze laughter from the lather
Drink water from the daughter

Neither matter
Neither taste
Neither solid
Neither space
The daughter brings the water
The daughter brings clear water

// Song For A Warrior //

There is a growing 
Golden light
a flower unfolding 
Behind the mirror of your eyes

If an angel could hold it
In his polished white hand
I know he'd release it
Like a bird to the sky

Now you are the warrior
Who will conquer this land
On a horse made of clouds
You will scatter the sands

Some people say
God is long dead
But I heard something inside you
With my head to your chest

Within
All the wrong
They say
I have done

There lies
A seed
Of a million more
Just waiting to become

Send them home!
Send them home!
Send them home!

Use your sword
Use your voice
And destroy
And destroy

Then begin again

// Avatar //

Your light is in my hand 
Your light is in my hand
Your light is in my hand
Your light is in my hand
Your mind is in my eye
Your mind is in my eye
Your eye is in my mind
My mind is in your hand
Your mind is in my mind
Your eye is in my eye
My mind is in your mind
Your eye is in my eye
Your eye is in my eye
Your light is in my hand...

// A Piece Of The Sky //

Through a door in the air
On a crumbling stair
In a clear and rushing vein
In a tunnel full of rain 
In a piece of yellow light
On the skin of my eye
Are you there?

In the wind of my lung
In methane and in love
In petroleum plumes
There's a floating slice of moon
In your tooth and your claw
and your unforgiving jaws
Are you there?

In a burning white ship
In the taste of her lips
In the blood of the swans
as the sun fucks the dawn
In the mud of a lake
In the drunk and the dazed
Are you there?

In the now that is not
on a ladder to god
On a mountain stripped bare
With your hand in my hair
Behind the face of the sky
on a disappearing line
Are you there?

In the then that was now
In the now that is not
In our names we forgot
In a thought we just lost
We become what we choose
We are stumbling fools
Who are not there

There's some tangled dirty twine
in some idiot's clouded mind
there's some wires that won't unwind 
around the ankles of the blind
There's walls lined with soft lead
and in that room is your bed
Is that really you?

Are you in there?
On the moon?
In the air?
Crushed in my hand?
Thrown in a fire?

// The Apostate //

It's not in my mind
It's not in my mind
Na a na not in my mind
Na a na not in my mind
We're on an infinite line
We're on an infinite line
Get out of my mind
Get out of my mind
Ge ge ge get out
Ge ge ge get out
God I can fly
God I can fly
We're on a ladder to god
We're on a ladder to god
Ladder to god
Ladder to god
Space cunt
Brain wash
Star dust
Space fuck- cunt
Cunt

Ge ge ge ladder to god
Ge ge ge ladder to god
Get fucked
Get fucked
We're on a ladder to god
We're on a ladder to god

We are blessed
We are blessed
Fuck
Bliss
