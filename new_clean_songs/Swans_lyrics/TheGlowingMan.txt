// The World Looks Red / The World Looks Black //

Push it away
The world looks red
People wish fish eyes
The ground sucks

Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog
The weight of my body is too much to bear
The memory drains the life from a dog

An ocean of insects works like a sheet
The immevoable fact buries my mind
In a horse-hair coat in a pile on the floor

Bury my mind
Bury mind
Bury my mind
Bury my mind

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Maker Man
Follow the Keeper Man
Follow the Leaver Man

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man

// People Like Us //

We're drifting goodbye
On a rust-colored cloud
Oh fallopian friends
Abandon us now
Our systems are full
Of bones ground to dust
The sky shows a bruise
Where our fingers have touched

Come suck on this vine
It tangles and nets
Come swallow the wine
We squeezed from our breast
The ocean is shifting
We're sailing amok
The methane is rising
To heaven above

We're tracing our shape
On the walls of your house
We're surfing the sand
That spills from your mouth
We're calling for more
Cause nothing is left
The words are all gone
There's more to be said

Send us away
On ships made of silk
Send us to fly
Black skies washed with milk
People like us
We need a dream to escape
People like us
We need to sleep to awake

// When Will I Return? //

One, two, three, four

His hands are on my throat
My key is in his hand
I'm splayed here on some curb
Shards of glass say starry night
When will this pigman stop?
His stink is like the dog
My life is mine to keep
I still kill him in my sleep
The car door is open wide
The mouth of death still calls my name
I'll beat him on his face
And I stab with all my strength
And I scream until he goes
I scream until he's gone
Then I crawl across the road
Then I crawl across the road
When will I return?
When will I return?

(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive

// The Glowing Man //

He's a real go-getter
He's a real heartbreaker
He's a real head-splitter

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!

He's a real mean keeper
He's a real deep teacher

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO: YES

Joseph is standing behind my back
Joseph is digging his hands in my chest
Joseph is drinking the light in my lung
Joseph is moving his tounge in my neck
Joseph is riding a vein in my head
Joseph is cutting my arm on his bed
Joseph is making my body fly
JOSEPH IS MAKING MY BODY FLY!

Joseph is me and you are a liar!
Joseph is me and you are a liar!

I am a Glowing Man I am!
I am a growing, Glowing Man!
I am a Glowing Man I am!
I am a growing, Glowing Man!
I am a nothing, No-Thing man!
I am a nothing, No-Thing Man
I am a growing, Glowing Man!
I am a growing, Glowing Man!
I am a no no no no no No-Thing Man!
I am a no no no no no No-Thing Man!

"What is, is what?"

// Finally, Peace //

With glittering hands
On collapsible land
We're praising the sun
For the damage he's done

A ruinous eyesore
Oh what is a mind for?
Just a knife in a lake
Just an arrow in space

All creation is hollow
And a picture's a shadow
Just a symptom of love
With a lack of a cause

Now the city's dissolving
And heaven's inhaling
While the ocean is thinking of a surface reflecting
Your glorious mind

Your glorious mind
Your glorious mind
Your glorious mind
Your glorious mind...
