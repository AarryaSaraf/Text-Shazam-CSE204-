// Laugh //

Choking while laughing
the dog splits open
his steel heart cracks
and his blood pumps out on the sidewalk
you laugh out loud
the sound hangs in the air
and discolors the walls
and poisons your mind
it sticks to your mind [x2]
bolt the door shut
and sit down at the table
while hiding your teeth
your insides split open
you choked on a laugh [x2]

// Speak //

Inhuman and stupid
the idiot crawls
into a crack
and eats his food
a diet of pain
he completely ignores
closing his mouth
he closes his mind
he talks to himself and listens
and says:
speak
talk to me in my sleep [x2]
walk me to the corner and strike a match
put it on my tongue
and say: speak

// Take Advantage //

Play with a pig, and you become a pig
Play in the mud, and you sink in the mud
fall in a hole, and you stay in a hole
you'll be there to look at, at the top of the stairs
they're talking about you
when they come down, they'll know what to do
they've worked out a scene
according to your weakness, according to how you can be used
look at the monkey suck and pull
look at monkey chew on his leash
because he wants control of his movements

// Sensitive Skin //

Standing naked in the corner
Sinking into the ground
Our hands connected to our feet
Our shadows burnt into the wall
Like the insomniac dreams:

Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension

Connecting tongues in the basement
X's tongue move moves down Y's throat
Y spits it back and fills X
Stalemate
Tied together in a permanent knot
Pressed together into one face

Throat:
Getting taken to basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
