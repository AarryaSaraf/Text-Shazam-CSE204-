// Jingle Bells //

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack! You'll take the lead.

// Santa Claus Is Coming To Town //

You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list,
And checking it twice
Gonna find out
Who's naughty
And nice. Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh! You better watch out!
You better not cry.
Better not pout, I'm telling
You why. Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

// Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas //

Have yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the yule-tide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon, we all will be together, if the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon, we all will be together, if the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

// What Are You Doing New Year's Eve? //

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Aah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's
New Year's Eve?

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
Welcoming in the New Year
New Year's Eve

Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of a thousand invitations
You received

Aah, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's
New Year's Eve?

// Sleigh Ride //

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you

// Good Morning Blues //

Good morning blues, blues how do you do
Good morning blues, blues how do you do
Babe, I feel alright but I come to worry you

Baby, it's Christmas time and I wanna see Santa Claus
Baby, it's Christmas time and I wanna see Santa Claus
Don't show me my pretty baby, I'll break all of the laws

Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea
Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea
Don't send me nothing for Christmas but my baby back to me

// Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! //

Oh the weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
It doesn't show signs of stopping 
And I've bought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 

When we finally kiss goodnight 
How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
But if you'll really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm 

The fire is slowly dying 
And, my dear, we're still goodbying 
But as long as you love me so 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight 
How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
But if you'll really hold me tight 
All the way home I'll be warm.

// Winter Wonderland //

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married ?" We'll say, "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Are you listenin', snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married ?" We'll say, "No man
You can do the job when you're in town"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonder, wonderland

// Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer //

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

// Frosty The Snowman //

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
with every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright,
and may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright,
and may all your christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
with every christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright,
and may all your christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright,
and may all your christmases be white

And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)
And may all your christmases be
(All your christmases be white)
(All your christmases be white)

// The Secret Of Christmas //

It's not the glow you feel
When snow appears
It's not the Christmas card
You've sent for years

Not the joyful sound
When sleigh bells ring
Or the merry songs
Children sing

The little gift you send
On Christmas day
Will not bring back the friend
You've turned away

So may I suggest, the secret of Christmas
It's not the things you do
At Christmas time but the Christmas things you do
All year through

// Christmas Island //

Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go

How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray, for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true
On Christmas Island your dreams come true
