Album: HelloDolly

// Hello Dolly //

Hello Harry, well, hello Louise
It's so nice to be back where I belong
You're looking great, Mary, I can tell, Jerry
You're still glowing, you're still crowing
You're still going strong

I feel the room swaying for the band's playing
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So here's my hat, fellas, find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello Harry, well, hello Louise
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You're looking great, Stanley, lose some weight, Stanley
You're still glowing, you're still growing
You're still going strong

I feel the room swaying for the band's playing
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So wow, oh wow, fellas, looking at all got loud, fellas
Dolly, you'll never go away
Dolly, you'll never go away
No, no, Dolly will never, ever go away again

// People //

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who need people

People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

// Can't Buy Me Love //

Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you'd say you love me too
I may not have an awful lot
But what I've got I'd give to you

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Love
Can't buy me love

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
Don't want money
Who wants money?
I don't care too much for money
'Cause money can't buy me love

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Money can't buy me love
Money cannot buy me love
No, no, money can't buy me love

// The Sweetest Sounds //

The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
Are still inside my head
The kindest words I'll ever know
Are waiting to be said

The most entrancing sight of all
Is yet for me to see
And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me

And the dearest love in all the world
Is waiting somewhere for me
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me

// My Man //

It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man

Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget
With my man
He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books
Is my man
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him!
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?

Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him

Sometimes I say
If I could just get away
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream
Of a cottage by a stream
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is
I am his forever more

// Volare //

Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!

No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings

// Memories Of You //

Waking skies
At sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be
Bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there
Everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all
Just recall
Memories of you

How I wish I could forget
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams
In my dreams
Spite of all I do
Everything
Seems to bring
Memories
Memories of you

// Lullaby Of The Leaves //

Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
Days so long ago when I was a tot, so high
And now that I have grown
I've found myself alone

Cradle me where summer skies can watch me with a million eyes
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with Heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
That pine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me
I've heard it before
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

That's heaven
Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Lullaby of the leaves

// Pete Kelly's Blues //

There are sad things
There are bad things, the blues
When they threaten
Start betting you'll lose

You hide yourself behind a prayer
The blues'll come and they'll find you there
I mean the blues they call Pete Kelly's Blues

There's no exit
You can try the blues
If you're born with
You will die with the blues
Think what you choose
That happy dream is yours they say
If you can pay the dues
That's why I'm stuck with
Fresh outta luck with the blues

There's no exit
None you can try with the blues
See if you're born with
You gotta die with the blues
Think what you choose
That happy dream is yours they say
If you can pay the dues
That's why I'm stuck with
So outta luck wit the blues

Some call 'em Pete Kelly's Blues
You can call 'em anything you choose
I call them blues
