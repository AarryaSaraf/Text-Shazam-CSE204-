// Call Me Darling //

Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
Thrill me, darlin', with a words I want to hear
In your dark eyes so smilin' a promise I see
But your two lips won't say you care for me

Oh my darlin', if my daydreams would come true
You would meet me at a secret rendezvous
And I'd find the paradise that lies deep in your eyes
Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear

// Sweet And Slow //

Sweet and slow
Rock-a-by me to and fro
While the band is moaning low
Honey take your time
Sweet and slow
We ain't got no place to go
We ain't going to buffalo
Honey take your time

You heard about the turtle
And the rabbit ran a race
You heard about the rabbit
Ended up in second place
Sweet and slow
While these lights are burning low
Honey I know
We can make it if we take it
Sweet and slow

Sweet and slow
While these lights are burning low
Honey I know
We can make it if we take it
Sweet and slow

// Georgia On My Mind //

Georgia
Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The roads leads back to you

Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

// Street Of Dreams //

Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams

Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams

Poor, no one is poor
As long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Love, love, love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams

Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams

Gold, silver and all
All you can hold
Is in the moonbeams

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

// It's A Blue World //

It's a blue world without you, it's a blue world alone
My days and nights that once were filled with heaven
With you away, how empty they have grown

It's a blue world from now on, it's a through world for me
The sea, the sky, my heart and I, we're all an indigo hue
Without you, it's a blue, blue world

// Darn That Dream //

Darn that dream, I dream each night
You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that dream, that dream, that dream
That wonderful dream

// She's Funny That Way //

I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
Just glad I'm livin' and happy to be
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

Though she'd love to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

When I hurt her feelin's once in a while
Her only answer is one little smile
I got a woman, crazy for me
She's funny that way

// My One And Only Love //

The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only, only love

// Body And Soul //

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh
Ffor you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul

// All Of Me //

All of me, why not take all of me?
Baby, can't you see, I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I'll never use them
Take my arms, I want to lose them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose 'em
Take my arms, I'll never use them
Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

[Scatting]

Come on and take, take all of me
