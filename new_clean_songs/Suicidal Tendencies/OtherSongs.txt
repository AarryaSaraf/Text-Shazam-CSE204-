// Don't Give Me Your Nothin' //

Don't you give me give me give me your borrowed time
Don't you give me give me give me your recycled line
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something

Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing

And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing

Don't you give me give me give me your look of concern
I don't need your meddling when you gonna learn
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'

Well I just made my perfect world-oops you're gone
Well now you know what it feels like not to belong-so long

So don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no

Don't give me your second-hand sympathy
Don't give me your nothin', just let me be
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something

Don't you give me give me give me your worried tone
You can't fool me with that crap just leave me alone
And I don't need it, I don't need nothing

Now I have a perfect world, now you're gone-oh oh oh
Don't give me your nothin', don't give me your nothin'

Don't give me give me give me that "What did I do?"
You don't have to do nothing, you're just being you
I'll tell you why, you ain't nothing

If you make your perfect world you will find
The only place that's perfect is in your mind
What's perfect for you is like a hell for me
Two perfect worlds, it just cannot possibly be-oh oh oh oh

Don't give me your nothin'
Don't give me give me give me your "I'll be there"
I don't believe how you lie, you don't care
Don't give me your shit, don't give me your nothin'

Don't give me give me give me your "I love you"
They just are words and the words ain't true
You're full of shit, your words mean nothing

And I just made my perfect world, now you're gone
And in my perfect world your perfect world don't belong-so long

No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'

// How To Kill A Rat //

A rat, a rat, I think I smell a rat
Don't stay stand there get the poison and the bat
Don't be squeamish, there's nothing wrong with that
A rat, a rat, got to kill a rat

No one likes a rat
How to kill a rat

Got to kill a rat

A rat, a rat, damn another rat
They're even worse than a little fluffy cat
Don't just stand there shoot 'em with a gat
A rat, a rat, how to kill a rat

No one likes a rat
How to kill a rat

well I may not have the best of manners
You'll never ever hear me say please
But I ain't here to mess with nobody
I'm just here to get myself some cheese

And I'm too smart to eat the rat poison
And mouse traps really are a bore
I'm looking for something of an extra challenge
Won't you call the exterminator

For fun I like to wait for him to ambush
Then I dash and slash and scamper cross the floor
Well I'm too quick for him, he'll never catch me
He'll just chase me till I'm tired and I'm sore

And I'm too smart to eat the rat poison
And mouse traps really are a bore
I'm looking for something of an extra challenge
Won't you call the exterminator

A rat, a rat, I think I smell a rat
Don't stay stand there get the poison and the bat
Don't be squeamish, there's nothing wrong with that
A rat, a rat, got to kill a rat

How to kill a rat

// I Shot The Devil //

I shot Reagan, I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shot you dead in heaven you'll rot
You're gonna rot in heave, hear an angel's voice
You're too bad for hell, although it's you first choice

Rot in heave, you're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven, cause you're forgiven in hell

I shot Lennon, I shot the Pope
I shot the devil, now you ain't got no hope
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an angel's voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice

// It's A Cyco Thang //

I tried it your way, it got me nowhere
Now I'm doing it my way

I'm feeling good, good, good
I wanna get bad, bad, bad
Forgot about the hurt, hurt, hurt
It's driving me mad, mad, mad
I'm going on a trip, trip, trip
I'm headed on a ride, ride, ride
I'm floating out to sea, sea, sea
I'm going against the tide, tide, tide

I don't need your approval
You'll get no explanation
I don't care what your thinking
All be told it's a cyco thang

It's a cyco thang, it's a cyco thang
You can take those flowers and shove the
Cause there ain't no hippies at this party

I ran into a hill, hill, hill
But that's O.K. I'll climb, climb, climb
I'm never giving up, up, up
I still got all my time, time, time
I wanna take it fast, fast, fast
And then I'll take it slow, slow, slow
You can not make it stop, stop, stop
It's my time to go, go, go

I know what I'm doing
I know why I am here
I got my way of living
And I don't care if you understand
Right now nothing else matters
I forgot about the pain
i got something that's better
All be told it's a cyco thang

Cyco, cyco, cyco, cyco
Eine, meine, minnie, moe
This one's died, that one can go
It's how I do it in an intellectual find
Oh my, blowing up my mind

// Suicide's An Alternative / You'll Be Sorry //

Sick of people-no one's real
Sick of chicks-they're all bitches
Sick of you-you're too hip
Sick of life-it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of trying-what's the point
Sick of talking-no one listens
Sick of listening-it's all lies
Sick of thinking-just end up confused
sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of life-it sucks

Sick of politics-for the rich
Sick of power-only oppresses
Sick of government-full of tyrants
Sick of school-total brainwash
Sick of music-top-40 sucks
Sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of life-it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of life-it sucks
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick of living-I'm gonna die

Suicide's an alternative

Well I've got a little story to tell
About a little red-assed punk that came from Hell
He said Satan's been looking especially for me
He said Satan's got a paper gonna set your body free
He said power and glory, bitches for screwin'
All in your name and all for you today

Oh yeah
Power and fame, all in your name
All the gold and bitches you ever could have

Oh yeah
You'll have power, fame, all in your name
All that you want, all that you need
Everything that you ever could read
Anything anything that you ever would need
Well sign the paper that's all you do
Sign the paper it's ready too
Anything there it's all for you
Well this is all you got to do

So I looked him in the eye and I said
"Fuck you you little red-assed goblined-breathed horned-hed motherfucker!"
Cause I don't care too much about gold
And I don't really give a fuck about what you've been told
And I don't really care for anyone looking after me
Cause I'm a meaner son of a bitch than that fuck ever could be

// What's The Word? //

So what's the word?
I'm looking for a word that can ease the pain
That we all suffer from living in a world that's insane
A simple word I could shout out or blurt
And that would take away all of the hurt
A word to soothe your soul when the tears flow
And that would make the smile on your face glow
Bury your bad memories in a deep grave
Free your mind from the chains of an emotional slave
A word as pretty as a purple sunset
A word so powerful you'll never forget
That I'd be willing to do anything for you
But I just need to know what to do

I'm looking for a word, is it a secret word?
I wish there was a word

I wish there was a word that could help you heal
That could take away all the pain you feel
Not asking for a word that can cure a disease
Just a word to put your mind at ease
I'm looking for a way to communicate
That all the people on the earth can relate
I'm looking for a word that won't let you down
That'll give you strength when I'm not around
A word that can fill you up when you're past empty
A peaceful place in your mind that's is always rent free

Yea I got to slow down
Cause too much is going down
How many times can one person cry?
How many times can one person die?

I'm looking for the word, that special magic word
I'm looking for the word, the secret word

So what's the word?
So what's the word?
My, my, my, another lie
Why, why, why, you got to lie?

So what's the word?
I spend too much time wondering what the hell is wrong with me
Where all you see is joy, pain is all I see
Suffocating in a world full of schemers
(Who are) Taking advantage of the hopes of the dreamers
I need a word to let you know that I need help
Cause sometimes I get so down on myself
Trying to find my place in this madness
Drowning myself in a cesspool of sadness

Yea I got to slow down
Cause it's getting so out of hand
Half of my homies that stood so proud next to me
Are doing time in the state penitentiary

Lie. lie, lie, until you die
Lie, lie, lie, until you die
So what's the word?
