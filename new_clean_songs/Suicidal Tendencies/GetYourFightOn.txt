// Get Your Fight On! //

We're here tonight...
It's on tonight
We're here tonight...
Tonight's the night

Just look around yo'll see the whole world gone crazy
I used to blame it on the hippies and stoners and the lazy
Cause you need a clear mind when you take it to the street
When you lift up the pipe you've already admitted defeat
We need not just the fists to lift up but the souls to rise
To fight on against the tyrants and systems we despise
And if you're waiting on a hero then we'll all be damned
While the politicians laugh on cause it's going just as they planned

We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight...so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!
Tonight's the night... let's get our fight on!

My head is pounding from the terror
That's keeps blasting out of the tv
Don't take a genius or a chemist to figure out it's pure insanity
I know it's instinct that try's tells you that you bet to hide and retreat
But we've already lost if you're afraid to be beat

So get your fight on!
And get your right on!
Now get your right on!
And get your fight on!

You got to believe in a purpose, you got to fight for the just cause
You got to know the difference of what's right and what's just a law
And you got to refuse that urge to ever, ever, ever give up
So are you ready to take on the fight, cause we know the world's
so fucked up
Let's get our fight on!

As long as we move as long as we breath- now get your right on!
As long as we live, we'll always believe – now got your right on!
As long as we breath, we'll always believe – now got your fight on!

We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight...so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!
Tonight's the night... so get your fight!
We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight...so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!
Tonight's the night... let's get our fight on!

// Nothing To Lose //

Pissed of (once again)
Red line (never ends)
Hard times (wanna loose)
Make one (out of two)
Bring down (pay my dues)
Nothing I (get no clues)
Won't quit (win or lose)
Cyco punk attitude

You said you knew the right way
I followed you but I don't like where it got me
So trust me when I say it yes I mean it
This is the truth, there's no fine line in between it

Trust me I got nothing to lose
Trust me I got nothing to lose

Let's go let's go
Let go let go
Let's go let's go
Ain't got nothing to lose
Let go let go

Let's go let's go
Let go let go
Let's go let's go
Ain't got nothing to lose
Let go let go

It's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose

Yeah

You've got a whole lot to lose

But you've got a whole world lot to lose

Trust me I got nothing to lose

Hard life? No I don't think so
It's different times and it's just the way that things go
Maybe I got it all wrong
I shouldn't care about their problems I'll just stay strong

It's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose

// Get United! //

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united
Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united

Bumped you and what do you get
A wound to your head less you soon forget
It's fast forward, it was mediated
But the vision that never showed up and created
The bye-product of when you divide
And give peace no place to hide
Another soul they say rest in peace
And now and then seeks onto a leash
The place has changed but not the pain
Over and over it gets me wiped again
It will never change until it's decided
Who's to gain by us being divided?
Fuck that, and you soon will see
Who in fact is a real enemy
The real challenge, will you face it or fight it?
It will only happen if you get united

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united

Straight for power
United
Straight for peace
Get united

Take a second, it's all so clear
The scenario, that's their worst fear
We're all low class scum in their eyes
So let's all give them a hell of a surprise
Suppose I had to take a tour in due course
And let's take it straight to the mother fuckin' source
To all of those that wanna keep us down
It's time that a new sherriff rolled his ass into town
We don't need no stinking badge on our chest
And let's get united and fuck the rest
Getting crazy and breaking laws
Put in work, for the cause
Just getting dope has got to me
We say a freedom fighter you say it's a felony
Put your recorder let's ride out the ride
If we're gonna take a side, let's do it side by side

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united

Brothers united and gangs united and folks united
Get united
United
Gangsters united and skaters united and suits united
Get united

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united
Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united

Paging Mr Psycho Michael
Please report to the microphone, immediately

We make it hit, we make you hot
Without the crazy beats that you just can't stop
Just deliver, straight over the top
The attitude is right, full rock
Fuck the name, free, pursuing legacy
Soon the fbi will say its service was after me
Said I shall make it and I'll shoot them again
That's where the love affair all began
They try to shake us down, take us down, break us down
But it takes a whole lot more than a bad rain cloud to
Bring a final fuckin' suicide man
'Cause you can't bring me down
You can't bring us down
Iauthority
You can't bring us down

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

(Okay, I think we've heard enough)
(It's time to step away from that mic)

A faster pace, in your face
Anytime or any place
For the power, for the scene or outer space
We'll dish it our like a verse you taste
I remember my first taste of police love
Got my ass beat with a Philly glove
In the alley with my hands right behind my back
That's a test of the devil of a mini attack
For four more days the police riots
The winner out there is their doughnut diets
The sign of the cross says to serve and protect
But we all know that's a bunch of shit
They give a kid a beatdown I'll never forget
So now I'm making sure that they'll never forget

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

(Drop the mic and come out slowly with your hands up)
(That was your last warning)

I done a full turn, I took the penalty
Show me no respect, no respect you see
You say fuck me? Fuck you!
Fuck my familia? then fuck yours too
Everyday I face another tear
But that won't change my definition of success
As long as this establishment tries to hold you back
It's your civic duty to be a maniac
A sense yellow pride if it can't fail
And I'll keep pushing until the end
I'll never be a law that can set you free
That's why I keep screaming: one more time

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

One more time, one more time

// Ain't Mess'n Around //

I'm sick and tired of the status quo
And here's something else that you should know
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
I don't care about authority
'Cause they don't give a damn about me
I want it, you got it, I ain't mess'n around

'Cause I'm as free as free can be
'Cause I believe and nothing can take that from me
'Cause I'm as strong as strong can be
And I will fight, I fight for what I believe

We all have our own right to live
You mess with me then something's gonna give
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
You call it wrong, but I call it right
You try to stop me then you've got a fight
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around

Come and join us and you'll see
That we are proud, 'cause we got the right to believe
Try to stop us and you'll see
That we are strong, and we fight for what we believe

The system doesn't care 'bout you or me
It only cares about prosperity
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
They lock the gates and they guard the doors
But we're good at sneaking through the cracks and pores
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around

I lost my hope and sensitivity
If that makes me crazy well I guess that's me
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
You can question my sanity
But you can't question my integrity
You got it, I want it, we ain't mess'n around, no

Come and join us and you'll see
Our future's now, and we back up what we believe
Try and shut us out you'll see
That we don't care, 'cause we know what not to believe

We're sick and tired of the status quo
And here's one more thing that you should know
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around
Don't give a fuck about authority
Cause authority don't give a fuck about me
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around

Ain't mess'n around
Ain't mess'n around
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around
Ain't mess'n around (don't give a fuck about authority)
Ain't mess'n around (cause authority don't give a fuck about me)
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around

// S.E.D. //

My house was kinda lonely
On the cutting of the emerging soil
Crazy hits, shot bitch
Hypnotised by violent fish
Feels like rats chewing under my skin (my skin yeah)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Destruction (dysfunction)
DFDS inside
It's almost like you have got nothing (nothing, got nothing)
The pressure on my chest, my tongue, makes me want to breathe
I can't breathe
While the empowered neighbor's putting pressure on me
Fuck me

Feels like rats chewing under my skin (rats under my skin)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Destruction (dysfunction)
Yeah to envision my self-hatred, right now
It's a working bombshell (hate, hate, hate myself)
No purpose, no day, no hump, no great protection
(No hope, no nothing)
Like predicted, my soul nicely mangled in suspension
(Dig, dig out of suspension)

After standing, naked and alone
I'm made to wonder just for how many other
Sins must I atone?
And as my mind's a fog and my shredded light is gone
I'm cursed with the knowledge that whatever good deeds
I do is never enough
And as you've said, it seems like things lead to multi
Multi years more
I think I won't quite receive the support I'm looking for
But I'm way too proud to have this taint me as damaged goods
As I'm quick to dare some post redemption and miracles
Sometimes meek and timid cast myself to possibly be
Another mercy, talk of mercy
It's a passing prize, I needed, you can't even care less
Everytime I tried to slay, demons were deep, deep
Deep within
You've been caught by the spirit
To better prevent the course of sin
You better have it in your conscience just as father, mother, mother
A simple deed for you, it's all I want to talk to now

No you, can't take me
No you, won't save me
No you, can't save me
Just change your state of mind
Systematic Emotional Destruction

Feels like rats chewing under my skin (my skin yeah)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Distruction
Systematic Emotional Distruction

To fight on against the tyrants and systems we despise
