// Concrete Jungle //

No sun will shine in my day today
(No sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(That high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said darkness has covered my light (Darkness has covered my light)
And has changed my day into night, yeah (And has changed my day into night)
Where is the love to be found?
Won't someone tell me?
'Cause life (Sweet life)
Must be somewhere to be found (Has got to be, out there somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
Where the living is hardest (Concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle (Concrete jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you've got to do your best (Concrete jungle)

No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
Yeah, now (Never know what happiness is)
I've never known happiness
I've never known what sweet caress is (Never know what sweet caress is)
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me?
'Cause I (Sweet life, has got to be)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(Out there somewhere for me)
In this here concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
I said, what do you got for me now (Concrete jungle)
Oh ! Concrete jungle (Concrete jungle, jungle, jungle)
Why won't you let me be, now? (Concrete jungle)

I said that life (Sweet life)
It must be somewhere to be found (Has got to be out there somewhere for me)
Oh, instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
Illusion (concrete, jungle !)
Confusion (Concrete, jungle !)

Eh ! Concrete jungle
You name it, you've got it in
Concrete jungle, now (Concrete jungle)
Eh ! Concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)
What do you got for me, now?

// Slave Driver //

Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Slave driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now
(Catch a fire)

Slave driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
You're gonna get burned
(Catch a fire)

Whoa now

Every time I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good God, I think it's illiteracy
It's only a machine that make money

(Slave driver)
The table has turned, y'all
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Slave driver, ugh)
The table has turned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Slave driver)
The table is turned y'all (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now (Catch a fire)

Every time I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
(Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh)
Oh God have mercy on our souls!
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Oh!

Slave driver
The table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned
(Catch a fire)
Slave driver (Slave driver)
The table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire
So you can get burned (Catch a fire)

// 400 Years //

400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And, the people, they still can't see

Why do they fight against
The youth of today?
And without youths
You'd be gone, all gone astray

Come on, let's make a move
(Make a move, make a move)
Now that the time, the time has come
Fools don't see
(Fools don't see, fools don't see)
But I know, the weak is strong

So, come with me
To a land of liberty
Where we can live
Live our lives and be free

400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same, the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And my people, still cannot see

Come with me, you black and you brown
You got to be free
Stop sittin' down on your pride
Just can't hide

400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Same, same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Why do black people close their eyes?
Come to reality
(400 years, 400 years)
You've got ability
Just can't see
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)

// Stop That Train //

Stop that train: I'm leaving - today!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teaching my people who don't understand
And even though I tried my best
I still can't find no happiness

So I got to say

Stop that train: I'm leaving - any day, now
Stop that train: I'm leaving - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some going east; and-a some going west
Some stand aside to try their best
Some living big, but the most is living small
They just can't even find no food at all

I mean, stop it

Stop that train: I'm leaving - leaving, mm-hmm
Stop that train: I'm leaving - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train: I'm leaving â€“ leaving!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - can't take it!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

// Midnight Ravers //

Do-do-do. Do-do-do. Do-do-do
(You can't tell the woman from the man)
No, I say you can't, 'cause they're dressed in the same pollution
(Dressed in the same pollution)
Their mind is confused with confusion
With their problems since they've no solution
They become the midnight ravers

Someone say

Oh, please, don't let me - ee-ya-bab, oh, please don't let me down!
(Midnight) Midnight ravers! (ravers) Midnight ravers!
(Please don't) Oh, please, please
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders - they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)
So you couldn't make them out in smoky place
(Make them out in smoky places)
In that musical stampede, where everyone is doing their thing
Musical stampede - people swinging
Musical stampede. Someone say
People, ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(Keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(Keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!
People, ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(Keep a-riding!) Ride on!
(Keep a-riding!) Midnight ravers!

I can't tell my woman from the man
She is dressed in the same pollution; (dressed in the same pollution)
Her mind is confused with confusion
To my problem seems there's never - never no solution!

I've become a night-life raver
And I'm begging you, (please) please, please
Oh, beel-ya-ba-ba - please don't you let me down!

(Night-life ravers) Night-life ravers! Night-life ravers!
Oh, please, please, please, please, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down!

I see ten thousand chariots (ah-ah-ah-ah)
And they coming without horses; (coming without horses)
The riders they cover their face, (ah-ah-ah-ah)

In that musical stampede, oh!
It's the musical stampede. Ride on!
It's the musical stampede, some preacher say!
People ride on! (keep a-riding!)
(Keep a-riding!) Ride on!
