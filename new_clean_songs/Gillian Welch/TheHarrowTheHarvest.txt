// Scarlet Town //

Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Never been there before
You slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor

I don't mind a lean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I spent some time in New Orleans
And came along a bend
But Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

On the day I came to Scarlet Town
You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like holly on a mountainside

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door

So fare you well, my own true love
If you never see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

// Dark Turn Of Mind //

Take me and love me if you want me
Don't ever treat me unkind
'Cause I had that trouble already
And it left me with a dark turn of mind

Now I see the bones in the river
And I feel the wind through the pine
And I hear the shadows a-calling
To a girl with a dark turn of mind

But oh ain't the nighttime so lovely to see?
Don't all the nightbirds sing sweetly?
You'll never know how happy I'll be
When the sun's going down

And leave me if I'm feeling too lonely
Full as the fruit on the vine
You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some have a dark turn of mind

You know some girls are bright as the morning
And some girls are blessed with a dark turn of mind

// The Way It Will Be //

I lost you awhile ago but still I don't know why
I can't say your name without a crow flying by
I got to watch my back now that you turned me around
Got me walking backwards into my hometown

Throw me a rope on the rolling tide
What did you want it to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it, that's the way it will be

It was seven years on the burning shore
With Gatling guns and paint
Working the lowlands door-to-door
Like a Latter Day Saint
Then you turn me out at the top of the stairs
You took all the glory that you just couldn't share

I've never been so disabused, I've never been so mad
I've never been served anything that tasted so bad
You might need a friend any day now, any day
Oh, my brother, be careful, you are drifting away

Throw me a rope on the rolling tide
What did you want it to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it, that's the way it will be
The way you made it, that's the way it will be

// The Way It Goes //

Becky Johnson bought the farm
Put a needle in her arm
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

And her brother laid her down
In the cold Kentucky ground
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when she and I were friends

Well, Miranda ran away
Took her cat and left LA
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

She was busted, broke and flat
Had to sell that pussy cat
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when he and I were friends

See the brightest ones of all
Early in October fall
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

While the dark ones go to bed
With good whiskey in their head
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

Now Billy Joe's back in the tank
You tell Musso, I'll tell Frank
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

Did he throw her down a well?
Did she leave him for that swell?
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when all of us were friends

When you lay me down to rest
Leave a pistol in my vest
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

Do you miss my gentle touch?
Did I hurt you very much?
That's the way that it goes
That's the way

That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when you and I were friends

// Tennessee //

I kissed you cause I've never been an angel
I learned to say hosannas on my knees
But they threw me out of Sunday school when I was nine
And the sisters said I did just as I pleased
Even so I try to be a good girl
It's only what I want that makes me weak
I had no desire to be a child of sin
Then you went and pressed your whiskers to my cheek

Fa la la la
Fa la la lee
Now let me go, my honey oh
Back to Tennessee
It's beef steak when I'm working
Whiskey when I'm dry
Sweet heaven when I die

Now I've tried drinking rye and gamblin'
Dancing with damnation is a ball
But of all the little ways I've found to hurt myself
Well you might be my favorite one of all

Fa la la la
Fa la la lee
Now let me go, my honey oh
Back to Tennessee
It's beef steak when I'm working
Whiskey when I'm dry
Sweet heaven when I die

Why can't I go and live the life of Riley?
Why can't I go back home to apple pie?
Cause your affront to my virtue was a touch too much
But you left a little twinkle in my eye

Fa la la la
Fa la la lee
Now let me go, my honey oh
Back to Tennessee
It's beef steak when I'm working
Whiskey when I'm dry
Sweet heaven when I die

Now some will come confessing of transgressions
Some will come confessing of their love
You were there strumming on your gay guitar
You were trying to tell me something with your thumb

Fa la la la
Fa la la lee
Now let me go, my honey oh
Back to Tennessee
It's beef steak when I'm working
Whiskey when I'm dry
Sweet heaven when I die

// Down Along The Dixie Line //

Way down in Dixie, oh do they miss me
Down along the Dixie Line
Banjos are strumming
Horseflies are humming
Ripe melons on the vine
The gold and the grey weeds
Saying look away
Way down along the Dixie Line

I spent my childhood walking the wildwood
Down along the Dixie Line
Freight trains are squalling
Eyeballs are bawling
Four engines at a time
I was so happy with Momma and Pappy
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball man
Leave that North Land far behind

A river of whiskey flows down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
They pulled up the tracks now
I can't go back now
Can't hardly keep from cryin'
Oh do they miss me way down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball man
Leave that North Land far behind

Down along the Dixie Line

// Six White Horses //

Six white horses coming two by two
Six white horses coming two by two
Coming for my mother, no matter how I love her
Six white horses coming two by two

Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
So broken hearted, up now they started
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels

See them horses pulling on a rein
See them horses pulling on a rein
Sunshine and sorrow, yesterday, tomorrow
Bedlam and Barlow Billy are their names

Some bright morning what will you see
Some bright morning what will you see
Some bright morning looking on it coming
Some bright morning what will you see

There's six white horses coming after me
Six white horses coming after me
Pretty as a picture, certain as a scripture
Six white horses coming after me

// Hard Times //

There was a camp town man, used to plow and sing
And he loved that mule and the mule loved him
When the day got long as it does about now
I'd hear him singing to his muley-cow
Calling, "Come on my sweet old girl, and I'd bet the whole damn world
That we're gonna make it yet to the end of the row"

Singing "hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more"

Said it's a mean old world, heavy in need.
That big machine is just picking up speed
They were supping on tears, they were supping on wine
We all get to heaven in our own sweet time
So come all you Asheville boys and turn up your old-time noise
And kick 'til the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor

Singing, hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, brother
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more

But the camp town man, he doesn't plow no more
I seen him walking down to the cigarette store
Guess he lost that knack and he forgot that song
Woke up one morning and the mule was gone
So come on, you ragtime kings, and come on, you dogs, and sing
And pick up the dusty old horn and give it a blow

Playing, hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, honey
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, sugar
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more

// Silver Dagger //

I'm on the dark side of a hollow hill
The sun comes up, babe, but it's hard to get my fill
Your blues are rapping and it fits my mood
I'm through with Bibles and I'm through with food
Somebody's calling, trying to track me down
And if I don't answer, I'd hang around
As side-passed lovers lost in the dark
I look for high ground for to build an ark
I can't remember when I felt so free
Maybe September, the year you believed in me
In 1900 and 99
When I found the angels a-drinking wine
Seems every castle is made of sand
The great destroyer sleeps in every man
Here comes my baby, here comes my man
With the silver dagger in his hand
Ooooh
With that silver dagger in his hand

// The Way The Whole Thing Ends //

Say you wanna see my garden
And you wanna make it shine
Say you wanna see my blue jeans
Hanging on your old clothesline
Standing in the backdoor crying
Now you wanna be my friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole thing ends

Now what's a little baby doing
Dressing up in banker's clothes?
What's a little sweetheart like you
Doing with a bloody nose?
Standing in the backdoor crying
Now you're gonna need a friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole thing ends

Now once you had a hook and ladder
Up into the headless night
And once you had a motorcycle
But you couldn't ride it right
Standing in the doorway crying
Now you're gonna need a friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole thing ends

Someone said something one time
But Daddy didn't talk too loud
People oughta stick together
That's the way to make a crowd
But here you come alone and crying
Now you wanna be my friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole thing ends

Momma's in the beauty parlor
And Daddy's in the baseball pool
Sister's in the drive-in movie
Brother's in the old high school
Now here you come alone and crying
Once, you know, you were my friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole thing ends

Standing in the backdoor crying
Now you wanna be my friend
That's the way the cornbread crumbles
That's the way the whole things ends
