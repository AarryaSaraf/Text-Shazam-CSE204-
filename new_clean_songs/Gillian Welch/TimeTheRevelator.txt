Album: TimeTheRevelator

// Revelator //

Darling, remember when you come to me
I'm the pretender and I, what I'm supposed to be
But who could know if I'm a traitor
Time's the Revelator

They caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
The Fortune Lady came along, she walked beside
But every word seemed to date her
Time's the Revelator, the Revelator

Up in the morning, up and on the ride
Drive into Corning and all the spindles whine
And every day is getting straighter
Time's the Revelator, the Revelator

Leaving the valley, fucking out of sight
I'll go back to Cali where I can sleep out every night
And watch the waves and move the fader
Time's the Revelator, the Revelator

Queen of the fakes and imitators
Time's the Revelator

// My First Lover //

My first lover
My first lover

He was tall and breezy with his long hair down
But he gets a little hazy when I think of him now

My first lover
My first lover

He was always talking tryin' to bring me down
But I was not waiting for a white wedding gown

From my first lover

I do not remember any goin' wrong
Just a record playin' that old Steve Miller song

Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl

At a surfer party with the whiskey pourin'
And the bottle rollin' I was on the floor

With my first lover
My first lover

I do not remember any fights or fits
Just a shaky morning after callin' it quits

With my first lover

Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl
Quicksilver girl and she's free

// Dear Someone //

I want to go all over the world
And start living free
I know that there's somebody
Who is waiting for me

I'll build a boat, steady and true
As soon as it's done
I'm going to sail along in the dreams
Of my dear someone

One little star, smiling tonight
Knows where you are
Stay, little star, steady and bright
To guide me afar

Rush, little wind, over the deep
For now I've begun
Hurry and take me straight into the arms
Of my dear someone
Hurry and take me into the arms
Of my dear someone

// Red Clay Halo //

All the girls, all dance with the boys from the city
And they don't care to dance with me
Now it ain't my fault that the fields are muddy
And the red clay stains my feet

And it's under my nails and it's under my collar
And it shows on my Sunday clothes
Though I do my best with the soap and the water
But the damned old dirt won't go

But when I pass through the Pearly Gate
Will my gown be gold instead?
Or just a red clay robe with red clay wings
And a red clay halo for my head?

Now it's mud in the spring and it's dust in the summer
When it blows in a crimson tide
Until trees and leaves and the cows are the color
Of the dirt on the mountainside

But when I pass through the Pearly Gate
Will my gown be gold instead?
Or just a red clay robe with red clay wings
And a red clay halo for my head?

Now Jordan's banks, they're red and muddy
And the rolling water is wide
But I got no boat, so I'll be good and muddy
When I get to the other side

And when I pass through the Pearly Gate
Will my gown be gold instead?
Or just a red clay robe with red clay wings
And a red clay halo for my head?

I'll take the red clay robe with the red clay wings
And a red clay halo for my head

// April The 14th Part I //

When the iceberg hit
Oh, they must have known
God moves on the water
Like Casey Jones

So I walked downtown
On my telephone
And took a lazy turn
Through the redeye zone

Was a five-band bill
A two-dollar show
I saw the van out in front
From Idaho

And the girl passed out
In the backseat trash
There were no way they'd make
Even a half a tank of gas

They looked sick and stoned
And strangely dressed
No one showed
From the local press

But I watched them walk
Through bottom land
And I wished I played
In a rock 'n' roll band

Hey, hey
It was the fourteenth day of April

Well, they closed it down
With the sales in rags
And I swept up the fags
And the local rags

I threw the plastic cups
In the plastic bags
And the cooks cleaned the kitchen
With the staggers and the jags

Ruination day
And the sky was red
I went back to work
And back to bed

And the iceberg broke
And the Okies fled
And the great emancipator
Took a bullet in the back of the head

// I Want To Sing That Rock And Roll //

I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I want to reach that Glory Land
I want to shake my Savior's hand

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to sing that rock and roll

// Elvis Presley Blues //

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem Queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler, baby
Like you never seen, like you never seen, never seen

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

How he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
He shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake, with his soul at stake, soul at stake

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
He shook it and he shine like gold
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, well bless my soul

He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, what's wrong with me?

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

Just a country boy that combed his hair
Put on a shirt his mother made and he went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
He shook it like a Harlem Queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler, baby
Like he never seen, never seen, like he never seen, never seen

// Ruination Day Part II //

And the great barge sank.
And the Okies fled.
And the great emancipater 
took a bullet in the head.

in the head...
took a bullet in the back of the head.

It was not December.
Was not in May.
Was the 14th of April.
That is ruination day.

That's the day...
The day that is ruination day.

They were one.
They were two.
They were three.
They were four.
They were five hundred miles from their home.

From their home...
They were five hundred miles from their home.

When the iceberg hit
well they must have known
that God moves on the water Casey Jones.

Casey Jones...
God moves on the water Casey Jones.

// Everything Is Free //

Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gonna give it away

Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
Try to make a little change
Down at the bar

Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
Never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

And everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away

Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home

And sing a little love song
My love, to myself
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That's what I say
No one's got to listen to
The words in my head

Someone hit the big score
And I figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

// I Dream A Highway //

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come and rest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

John, he's kicking out the footlights
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand
I dream a highway back to you

I think I'll move down into Memphis
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue
I lie and wait until the wagons come
And dream a highway back to you

The getaway kickin' up cinders
An empty wagon full of rattling bones
Moon in the mirror on a three hour Jones
I dream a highway back to you

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come arrest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram
I send a letter, don't know who I am
I dream a highway back to you

I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight
Any second now, I'm gonna turn myself on
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray
I dream a highway back to you

I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds
Fire riding, wheeling when I lead 'em up
Drank whiskey with my water, sugar in my tea
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags
I dream a highway back to you

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come molest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

Now, give me some of what you're having
I'll take you as a viper into my head
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed
I dream a highway back to you

Hang overhead from all directions
Radiation from the porcelain light
Blind and blistered by the morning white
I dream a highway back to you

Sunday morning at the Diner
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears
I watched the waitress for a thousand years
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call
I dreamed a highway back to, you

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come molest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

Step into the light, poor Lazarus
Don't lie alone behind the window shade
Let me see the mark death made
I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you

What will sustain us through the winter?
Where did last years lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow
I dream a highway back to you

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision, come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to you
