Album: GetIntoSomething

// Get Into Something //

Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Love, let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began

But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

No no no no

Tell me what it is
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find a place for me
Try to find, find a place for me

'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, let me know
Let me know, oh
Love
Oh, baby
Stay at your best baby, yeah
Please do it for God's sakes

// Freedom //

// Take Inventory //

Ooh, I want all you fellas to take good inventory
Listen to my story:

"If you give true love
And I know you do
Soon your woman
Will believe in you
So you can't be too sweet
I know you can't be too kind
She'll break your heart, boys
And control your minds"
(Listen to my story)
One thing I know now
And this is a fact (Take an inventory)
She'll be cryin'
And tryin' to take you back

No, good man
Don't go for it
Don't be a fool
Well, well, won't you tell her (Listen to my story)

To dry her eyes
And go away (Take an inventory)
But not too far, baby
You may want her back someday (Listen to my story)
And if this happens
She'll go by your rules (Take an inventory)
She'll do what you tell her
And you'll do what you wanna do

Alright, just sit back and be cool
(Listen to my story)
Alright
And she'll do what you tell her to do

Ooh
Well, well, well, well

Be sure to lie (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
And be sure to cheat (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
(Listen to my story)
Always keep that woman beggin'
At your feet
Don't be so loyal (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
And don't be so true (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
(Take an inventory)
'Cause if you are, boy
They'll run over you

Show who's the boss, now (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
And show who's the king (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
(Listen to my story)
Show you can be cold, now
And you can be mean
Alright (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Tell me how you like my story (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
(Take an inventory)

Ah, did you take good inventory? (Take an inventory)
If you have, then it's good, now (Take an inventory)
Oh, but if you haven't, you should (Take an inventory)
Ha, tell me how you like my story (Take an inventory)
Did you take good inventory? (Take an inventory)
Ow, if you haven't, you should, babe (Take an inventory)
Well, if you have, then it's good (Take an inventory)

// Girls Will Be Girls, Boys Will Be Boys //

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another

They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now

They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh, don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but [?]

You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another

They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers

// I Need You So //

I wandered around in a daze
Not knowing just what to do
When all at once, the moon came out
And there in the light stood you

I need you so
I'll never let you go
So please say you need me, too
Girl, I'm so hung up on you
I need, I love you so

Well, love
Love is strange and it's simple
It's easy to fall into
So, if I should fall, no one would blame me
For falling in love with you

I need you so
I'll never let you go
So please say you need me, too
Girl, I'm so hung up on you
I need you so

And now, darling
More than ever before
I find myself completely lost in you

Ooh, I love you
I want you
I need you

I love you (I love you)
Girl, I want you (I want you)
I need you

I love you (I love you)
Girl, I want you (I want you)
I need you
Oh

// If He Can You Can //

If he can do it
Then you can do it
If it's right for him
Then it's right for you
Two can play the game
There's no excuse
If it's good for the gander, doggone!
It's gotta be good for the goose

I ain't gonna stand here (If he can do it, you can do it)
Uh uh, and tell no lie (If he can do it, you can do it)
I sure like [?] (If he can do it, you can do it)
'Cause you sure look fine (If he can do it, you can do it)
What he don't know, don't know
And what he can't see, sure 'nuff, pal
Will never hurt him, baby
But sure help me

Make up your mind, now (Right on, right on)
If you're gonna do it (Right on, right on)
Right on (Right on, right on)
Keep on (Right on, right on)
Yeah

While you in the kitchen, hey, now, now
Your man is running around (If he can do it, you can do it)
When you need a little love (If he can do it, you can do it)
He's nowhere to be found

Make up your mind (Right on, right on)
If you're gonna do it (Right on, right on)
Right on (Right on, right on)
Right on, yeah (Right on, right on)
