// Hold On Baby //

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, he's tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now

When he tries
Please don't let him
My advice will be
Better forget him

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

I don't blame him, baby
You're so fine
If he thinks he's gonna get you
He's out of his mind

Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

// You Better Come Home //

You better
You better come home right now
Don't wanna keep waiting around
For you to make up your mind

Honey, you better read this letter
I ain't gonna wait too long

Yeah, you better
You better stop moving around
Don't wanna keep hearing from friends
That you found somebody new

Honey, you better read this letter
Or I'll find someone better than you

You write me and tell me
You're gonna crack
I believe that you're
Never, never coming back

Well, maybe, baby
That is true
Just how long you think
I'll wait for you

You better, better
Better, better, better
You better take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better
Take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

You better, better
Better, better, better
I ain't going away, baby
Come home before it's too late

// Time After Time //

Ooh, time
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you, you run to see
In the evening or when
The day is through

And I
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so, so new

And time
Time after time
You're gonna hear me
I'm gonna say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
