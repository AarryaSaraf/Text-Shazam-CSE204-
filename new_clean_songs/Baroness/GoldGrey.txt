// Front Toward Enemy //

So, I lied
It was a cold summer
By fall, true winter flows like a virgin spring

We're headed for disaster
But I won't close my eyes until it's over
So carry on
Some wars I gladly died in
But most fights only got me bloody
I carried on
And when every drop of blood I shed
Was spilled in vain
I carried on

We're headed for disaster
Disaster
Front toward enemy
We can only face
Front toward enemy

Front toward enemy
Enemy

There's a mile of rope that lays between my shoulders
It doesn't mean that I intend to hang
And I'm not afraid of dying
Like I know I should be

So, I lied
It was a cold summer
By fall, winter's truth will flow like a virgin spring

// I'm Already Gone //

Did I make a huge mistake
When I said your name?
Oh, I miss the sweet perfume
Of oil and gasoline
All the stars, all the suns
All the air I breathe
All the empty bottles that I leave

Before you know
I'll be on the open road
Now I'm black and green
Golden at the seams

I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone

All I made were big mistakes
Always went too far
All the stars, all the suns
All the air I breathe
All the empty promises I keep

Before you know
I'll be on the open road
Now I'm black and green
Golden at the seams

I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
And I'm already gone

// Seasons //

Where are the seasons that have passed?
Wouldn't they wait?
Staring outside the window, trashed
Swimming inside me

Where are the shadows I have cast?
Wouldn't they wait?
Didn't they find the way out
Living inside me?

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn but we survive

Forget me when I'm gone
Settle in and don't forget to go to bed
You tucked your fingers away
All of the seasons that I have lost
Where did they run and hide?
Where do we go when the well runs dry?
Seasons all we know

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive

// Tourniquet //

Bought an artificial heart and it's broken
It never started
Please operator, take it out of here
Don't let it be the death of me
Filled my bloodstream up with poison and ashes
Now I'm starving
Don't ever let me go, my sweet amphetamine
Holding on, all alone

Somebody throw me a tourniquet
I'm open-hearted
I took a shot in the dark and I'm wasted
Start it all again
I tried to save myself from a heart attack
But I had it coming
Another shot to my cardiac
Did not start it up

Wake me up on the ocean floor
A storm's passing overhead
Warning me to come ashore
In the blink of an eye
My heart still breaks
My blood still waits
I'll never sleep alone

I've got an artificial heart
It beats but I can't feel a thing
It's an unofficial part
It bleeds but I'm already gone

Better hurry up with the tourniquet
'Cause I'm open-hearted
Please operator, take it out of here
And start it up

I've got an artificial heart
It beats but I can't feel a thing
It's an unofficial part
It bleeds but I'm already gone

// Anchor's Lament //

Throw me an anchor
Throw me an anchor
Throw me an anchor
Throw me an anchor

// Throw Me An Anchor //

The stars that shone between us
Were bluish-green and golden-like
Beware the hand that feeds us
Where the birds of prey
Hold onto the stolen light

Throw me an anchor
I hope you learned
When you gave me fire
I made it burn

The stars that shone between us
Were bluish-black and gold
The colours spreading everywhere
Begin to fade
Like bleach on poison-ivy skin

This is an emergency
This is an emergency

The stars that shone between us
Were all in monochrome

This is an emergency
The last one out will pay
This is an emergency
This is an...
Emergency

You'd throw me an anchor
And hope I'd learn
When you hold me to fire
You'd think I'd burn

When you bathe in fire
I'd throw you an anchor
I know you learned
When you hand me a lighter
I will make it burn

// I'd Do Anything //

If you pulled gently I'd fall right back into line again
You help me check myself and all that I surround
It was moments ago
Knew exactly what to say
Spilling on the ground
The words forever gold and grey

When I make my escape
Will I get sucked up by the rain?

I am selfish, I am wrong
I'm scared to be alone
Every aching joint breaking at the bone

I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive
I would do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything, anything

The world keeps burning
So it's back into the fire again
You kept me low but I am
High above the ground
No, you didn't miss a word
You know exactly what I said
"I lost myself when I loved my enemy"

I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive
I would do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything, anything

// Emmet: Radiating Light //

When I go out
Will you find me?
Where I'm supposed to be
Is no longer a place for me

If I go out
Will you find me?
Where I'm supposed to be
Is no longer a place for me

If you go out
I will find you
(It's) Where you're supposed to be
Is no longer a place for me

This blood upon my hands
Bruises on my knees
Don't belong to me

I'm in a shower
Of radiating light
But not where I belong

"If I walk in
Will you find me?"
Is where I want to be

"When I go out
Will you find me?"
Is where I want to be

// Cold-Blooded Angels //

Cold-blooded angels in blankets of ash
Alone in the southern pines
There's a place in the garden
Where nothing will grow
But I could stay forever
Where I lay every night on the forest's floor
Asleep with both eyes open
'Cause I need that bitter hand
That struck me blind
To keep my eyes from closing

Pale as the rose or the shadow it throws
Over earth and sky
If the rocks in my pocket
Were cinder and stone
I'd owe it all to nothing

Wasted years on an empty road
Where flies buzz around my head
Now I miss the bitter hand
That cut me down
All the way to nothing

Wasted years on an empty road
Where flies buzz around my head
If the dust in my pocket
Was silver or gold
I'd spend it all on nothing

There's something waiting at the door
I hear it breathing
Follow even though I'm sure
I should be leading
There's something waiting at the door
I see it bleeding
Every time I ask for more
I can't believe it

All I need was hanging 'round the door
I'm not sleeping anymore
'Cause I remember every single word
Every little thing I can't forget

Cold-blooded angels
Stop staring at the sky
We all pay a terrible price
When we learn to fly
And if I could forget you
Oh, how hard I tried
Please, somebody tell me
How the hell did I survive?

// Broken Halo //

She is the deepest ocean
That I could hope to drown in
If my iron wings should break again
I hope I'd fly into your eyes

Cold and grey
Your eyes were cold and grey
I would do anything
To feel like I'm on fire again

I wouldn't hold my breath and stop the tide from rising
I'd open up my lungs

Let me hold your salt and sorrow in place
Like a wind that never breaks

I would tear my heart out
I'd walk a thousand crooked miles
Then I'd start a fire
Turn the world to flame
To watch it shining in your eyes

Cold and grey
Your eyes were cold and grey
I would do anything
To feel like I'm on fire again

I won't close my eyes to keep the sun from rising
I'll hold them open wide

Let me hold your broken halo inside
Like a sun that never shines

I hope your eyes
Are black on fire

Let me hold the salt and sorrow in place
Where the waves will never break
Let me hold your broken halo
Where the sunlight never shines

// Borderlines //

Falling like a hammer
On a solitary arc
It struck a nail
Now we'll never be apart
Just a shadow on the wall

And I curse the ground beneath my feet
Curse the boiling sea
Curse the stars above my head
Staring back at me

Damn the whip that cracked and split
Damn the hand behind it

Wait for me
By my gallows pole
Hang around
I won't be long

Borderline
Get me out alive
When it rains
I am right where I belong

I'm sorry but the voice
Inside my head, won't let me go
I know you won't forgive me
For the things you'll never know
Come back to me sweet Armageddon
Hurry up and find me

Wait for me
By the iron rail
Hold on

Borderline
Get me out of line
When it rains
I am right where I belong

Across the borderline
The architect stunned by his design
I never fell so hard
You'll be the axe... I'm your hesitation marks

Borderline
Gets me out alive
When it rains
Boy, it really rains

// Pale Sun //

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Night fall
Panic setting in again around me
Night fall
You've hidden your black eyes away again
Knives fall
I don't want to hear
The sound of breaking skin
Knives fall
Of fear and darkness
Coming down around me

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking
