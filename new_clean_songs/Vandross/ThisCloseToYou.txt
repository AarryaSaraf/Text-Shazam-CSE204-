Album: ThisCloseToYou

// This Is For Real //

If I wanted to
I'd have anything
I could ever need
Anything, indeed

But if I can't have you
I'd be lost within
And everything else, baby
Would really not be worth having

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real

If I had a little time
I'd change what I am
But without you baby
I don't even give a damn

Cause what I am won't change
Until you change it to
Anything you want it to be
I'm putting my trust in you

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
Real

I thought it out the other day
And came to the conclusion
That I wouldn't last a minute without you, baby
You did it to me, baby
When you walked out on me
Now I've got to make you understand
That I wont be bad anymore

Honey, this is for real
Everything that I'm saying
Ever word that I'm saying
Is the thought of a brand new man
I've gotta have you back
So that I can make you see
That I'm not fooling around
This is a brand new me

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
This is how I feel
So you, you've got to understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
You've got to understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real

// A Lover's Change //

I'd like to be the kind of guy
Who has love in his heart
Every minute of the day and night, oh yes
I'd like to be the perfect lover

But if my heart were never wrong
You wouldn't want me very long 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

From when I get up in the morning
I've got to show you how (I love you) I truly feel
[?] see what I feel now
For you I've got to be real
Yes I do now

Though sometimes we don't get along
My love for you is very strong 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

Sometimes we kiss and hug all day
I love it when we do
But I don't always feel that way 'cause

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

When in love you change
Everyday ain't the same
It's a lover's change
Feeling joy, feeling pain

// Don't Take The Time //

Now and then I look at you
And feel that we ain't really
What we used to be
Love ain't easy
It seems you've been away
From loving me for such a long time
That it's no surprise that you're leaving

Well if by chance you should run into me
Don't take the time to make me cry
You've been away for quite a while
But darling so have I

Last time I saw you
You said that loving me
Was something you couldn't forget
You think you're leaving me
But it's a two way kinda feeling
That we seem to have

So if by chance you should see me dear
Don't take the time to explain why
You've been away for quite a while
'Cause darling so have I

This is the time to realize
That love didn't last forever
No no, no no
Love can be make believe, it can be fun
It's only fun when it don't go wrong

Don't tell the world that you gave me up
Because you know that it's only a lie
It's only your side
Don't say that you're leaving me
'Cause you know down in your heart
That it's only half true
I'm leaving you too

So if by chance you should run into me
Don't take the time to make me cry
You've been away for quite a while
And darling so have I
You've been away for quite a while
And darling so have I
You've been away for quite a while
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I
You've been away
And so darling have I

If you should see me
Don't take the time to make me cry
Darling
If you should pass me by
Don't take the time to make me cry
Darling

// Jealousy In Me //

I lay awake every night
Trying to find a reason
Why jealousy possesses me
Even when you're teasin'
Fire is in my mind
My whole world is burnin', burnin'
Jealousy possesses me
Keeps me tossin' and turnin'

The jealousy has got a hold on me
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby

I'm alone again at night
But it leaves me time for thinking
Why jealousy possesses me
Where are you this evening?
All of my life
I've had this jealous way
Jealousy will be the end of me
Where are you today?

Jealousy is in me
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby
I get crazy, baby
Stone cold crazy, baby

My heart's filled with jealousy
Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy (jealousy)
Stone cold crazy (jealousy)
Jealousy

Everytime I see you walkin'
With somebody else
I get crazy (jealousy)
Stone cold crazy (jealousy)

Tell me, tell me why
My heart's filled with jealousy
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is
Everytime I see you walkin' down the street
My heart's filled with jealousy

Oh yes it is
Everytime I see
You walkin' down the street
My heart's filled with jealousy
Oh yes it is, oh yes it is

Take it away
Everyday in every way
Jealousy has got a hold on me
Mercy, mercy
Cause' jealousy has got a hold on me
Jealousy

Take it away...

// I'm Not Satisfied //

When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

I start to walk and call you up
And you're still on the line
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

Don't give me like
When it's love I need
When I need your warmth
Don't leave me out to freeze
Expecting to wake up to laughter
And find that you've cried
Isn't that enough
Not to be satisfied

When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

I wait around
For you to come
But you always seem
To keep me hangin' on
You don't come
You don't call
Sometimes I think
You don't care for me at all

When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied
No, not not, not at all, no

I walk around with my head hung low
I can't get love, no
No satisfaction, no, baby

I walk around with my head hung low
I can't get love, no
No satisfaction, no, baby

Everytime that I'm with you
I'm in heaven, yes I am, yes I am
Sometimes when I call you
I can't find you nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Would you be there
So that I can love you, baby
Love you, baby

// This Close To You //

It's funny how I used to see you every day
But on one particular day I looked over at you in the usual nonchalant way
And it seemed as if I had never seen you before
It felt strange that I used to deny your existence
And then it dawned on me that I had never been

This close to you
I feel the strange and eery vibrations of love
This close to you
Is like a breezy summer day
And for the first time
I feel the compulsion to say hello, ooh

Well I'm the one that you've talked about in song
You've been going out of your head
And I never knew what you were up to
I apologize for making you wait so long
You've been very, very kind
And I feel kinda crazy, baby, crazy, crazy

This close to you
Has made this a strange and ominous day
Ooh, my love, is this an omen telling me
That I should run for love
I never thought that I'd be in love
And I never thought that I'd want to be
This close to you

It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be this close to you
It ain't never even crossed my mind
That I'd want to be...

I never knew, never never
Never, no
I never knew that I'd want to be
That I'd want to be this close to you

// Don't Wanna Be A Fool //

I was alone and blue
Until I came by you
Yeah, I was always down
Until you come around

But what I could not see
Is that you were playin' with me
Instead of happiness
You brought the misery

I couldn't face life without love
Now I see it's no good for me
From now on I'll be alone
And I won't have to be a fool anymore

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
So I surely will never love again
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
We can never be more than friends

Can't help remembering
Some of the better things
Like when we used to do
The things we loved to do

This really can't be real
Because you made me feel
That I had everything
That happiness could bring

I thought that it was all a lie
When they told me that you were payin' around
You know it really makes me cry
When I think about how you brought me down

Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
So I surely will never love again
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool
We can never be more than friends

Oh baby
Oh oh
I'll never love again (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
We can't be more than friends (Can't be a fool, my baby)
Cause there's a million broken-hearted people in the world (Can't be a fool)
That's why I can't be a fool, no (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
And that's for love (Can't be a fool, my baby)
There's not enough guarantee on it, yeah (Can't be a fool)
True love is hard to find (Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
And it ain't every day (Can't be a fool, my baby)
That you can get it, get it, get it, get it all (Can't be a fool)
(Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
That's why I can't be a fool, no (Can't be a fool, my baby)
I can't be a fool, no no (Can't be a fool)
(Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool)
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be a fool no
(Can't be a fool)
No oh
(Can't be a fool)
Can't be a fool

// Come Back To Love //

I've never been alone before
And sometimes it makes me cry
But I have a feeling
That all the love
That's missing from my life
Will have a way back to me
If you come back to love

I never had to think about
The bad side of my love
But lately over and over again
I can't seem to think of nothing else
And life without love
Is scaring me to death
And I've been crying
I need someone
Come back to love

Will you come back to
The love that I'm used to
Will you come home to
The love that I'm used to
And give me the love that I count on
The love that I depend upon
That love that helps me make it through the night
And makes everything alright
Come back to love

I've never been alone before
And sometimes it makes me cry
But I have a feeling
That all the love
That's missing from my life
Will come back to me
If you come back to love

Will you come back to
The love that I'm used to
Will you come home to
The love that I'm used to

Come back to love
I need you here
I want your love, so come on
...

// Follow My Love //

I am a sunshine person
But it's been rainin'
I wish the clouds would go
So the sun can restore the light

I've cried a thousand tears or more
Maybe a million
But of one thing I'm very sure
I'm gonna be alright

So if the sun would come
And shine on my love
I'd be the happiest man
In the world

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love
Ooo, follow my love
Ooo, my love

I am a sunshine person
You are my lady
You're everything I live for
Sunshine and love
If I have peace of mind
I'm thinking of you
When I'm thinking of sunshine and love
That's all I need to do

So when the sun comes down to
Shine on my love
I'm in a world
That keeps me satisfied

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love

Ooo, follow my love
Ooo, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love
My my my my my my...

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love
...
