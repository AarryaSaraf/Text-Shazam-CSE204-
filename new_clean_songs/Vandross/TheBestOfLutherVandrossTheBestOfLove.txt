// Never Too Much //

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinkin' of you

I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'

Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I'm winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginnin'

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop

Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

// A House Is Not A Home //

A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Woah girl

A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears

Pretty little darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there
Sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah

I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there, still in love
I said, still in love, still in love with me, yeah

Are you gonna be in love with me?
I want you and need you to be, yeah
Still in love with me
Say you're gonna be in love with me
It's drivin' me crazy to think
That my baby couldn't be still in love with me

Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Well well, well well

Still in love, so in love, still in love with me
Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna be
Still in love with me, yeah

With me, oh
Still in love with me, yeah

// Bad Boy / Having A Party //

Roll back the rug everybody
Move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Everytime that we meet
We skip and we dip to the beat, Yeah Yeah
What in the world could be better
Than getting together

The last time we had a party
It ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you
That you couldn't go out
Stay in the house

[Chorus:]
Bad boy
He's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
'Cause he sure wants to get out and dance
Everyone's here, let 'em all in
The chandelier downstairs has fallen
I know it's hard to resist
This is the party no one wanted to miss
But if you don't get home on the double, boy
You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does she'll be here soon

Boy, she's gonna be mad
You're a bad boy and you've got it bad boy
Boy, say goodbye to your friends
'Cause it's gonna be a while til you see them again

[Chorus]

Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio
Having a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music
On the radio
You can't go

[Chorus]

// Since I Lost My Baby //

[Chorus:]
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Oh since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore
And with money I'm poor
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh since I lost my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Next time I'll be kinder, to my lady
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)
Someone just remind her
Of this love she left behind her
Til I find her I'll be trying to
Everyday I'm growing kinder
Tryin' to find her,find her
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)
I've been looking everywhere (My baby)
Hey baby I really really care

My determination is fading fast
So fast, so fast so fast
Exploration is a thing of the past
I can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad
So sad, so sad, so sad

[Chorus and Fade]

// Promise Me //

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me
Can we stay together

[Bridge:]
Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing
But now you've turned around
Don't you even care how this love
We've had turns out

[Chorus:]
(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(That we'll be in love forever)
(Promise me, you'll leave me never)
(And that we'll be in love forever)

We can work at our love
And make it all brand-new
If we stay together
There's nothing we can't do
Improve the lovin' is what I'm seeing
Let's do it baby
Don't fight the feeling
Won't you love me
Can we stay together

[Repeat Bridge and Chorus]

Forever, ever, promise me you'll leave me never
Won't you promise me (That you'll leave me never)
Promise me, forever and ever, and ever

[Fade]

// Superstar / Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do) //

I wanna tell you, baby
The changes I've been goin' through
Missin' you, missin' you, oh...oh...
Till you come back to me
I don't know what I'm gonna do
N-n-n-no, n-n-no

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you
Yeah...I really do

Long ago
And oh, so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show

And your guitar
And you sound so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yeah
I love you

(To belong) Whoa...ho...oh...whoa...ho...ho...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

You looked for me to be yours
You want my love, but you're on the road
Don't you remember me anymore

Loneliness
Is such a sad affair
A sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again

And what to say, to say
To make you come again
Oh, honey
Come on back to me again, yeah, hey
I wanna be, I wanna be anywhere you are

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, woo, baby, oh, baby

Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright
Alright now
Keep it right there, keep it right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright

I used to be sad
But now it's alright, it's alright
Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright
Alright now
I wonder, I wonder
Where are you again tonight
Are you holdin' someone else real tight
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

// 'Til My Baby Comes Home //

There's a whole lot of girls
Messin around
Trying to get me

They do things cause they know
My girl is away
They try to upset me

They can't believe I resist
How can I hold out,
Where is that girl now
But the truth really is
I don't worry cause I love you baby so, That...

[Chorus:]
No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
Til my baby comes home
If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin
Head gets to achin
Is she thinkin of me
Or feelin the fire
With some other guy, yeah
I can't believe I can be
Worried about her
I should'ntdoubt her
Cause our thing is for real
And I don't worry
Cause I know, I know, I know...

[Chorus]

Bring it on
Home to me
She makes everything alright, shes
Good to me
Shes the best part of my life
Can't you tell
That I'm just like a new guy, I'm doing
Very well
Cause I know shes coming back tonight

Every night when I sleep
I dream of my baby
Shes such a lady
Then I wake up and see
That shes laying by me
Right there beside me
I can't explain how I fell
I really love her, keep dreaming of her
Cause our love is for real
And I don't worry
Cause I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]

// If Only For One Night //

Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fear
It would be so nice
If only for one night

I won't tell a soul
No one has to know
If you want to be totally discreet
I'll be at your side
If only for one night

Your eyes say things i never hear from you
And my knees are shakin too
But i'm willin to go thru
I must be crazy
Standin in this place
But i'm feeling no disgrace

For asking...

Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fear
It would be so nice
If only for one night

I tell you what i need is
One night, one night oh (and oh, oh)
What i need is
One night, one night
Of your love, of you love, of your lovin ooh
I'm asking...

Let me take you home
To keep you safe and warm
Till the early dawn
Warms up to the sun
It would be so nice if only for one night

If only for one night
If only for one night
If only for one night, night, night, yeah one night
If only for one... night

// Creepin' //

I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be that you always
Creep into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting,
Huggin' squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be that you always
Creep into my dreams

When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ectasy
When you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy
Oh love is so amazing (Oh oh oh oh)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be that you always
Creep into my dreams

[Fade]

// Stop To Love //

Lately love keeps keeping up at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight
Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not
You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me
But you fly away almost everyday
You work a lot but you never stop to love

[Chorus:]
Stop, I love you so stop
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop
Say you're coming home

You say my love has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime?
Too many empty nights, can make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get whenever he's at home alone.

Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away, but you couldn't rest
Had to do your best to reach the top
But you did not stop to love

[Chorus]

And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya
Gotta stop to love
No one loves you better
Can't you stay forever?
Stop to love
I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on home, that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

[Chorus]

// So Amazing //

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and it's changed my whole world
Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...I'd go

And it's so amazing, amazing
I could stay forever, forever
Here in love and no, leave you never
'Cause we've got amazing love

Truly it's so amazing, amazing
Love brought us together, together
I will leave you never and never
I guess we've got amazing love

Ooh, so amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Oh, and it's so, it's so

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
And you know, it's so

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Hey...hey...hey...yeah...it's so

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Hey...hey...yeah...hey...yeah...yeah...hey...it's so

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

// Give Me The Reason //

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh
Eah-eah-eah
Oh

What's there to say, there's not much to talk about
And whatever happened to all of the love that we vowed
Yes, it's true
And there's nothing new
You can say

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love

Yeah-eah
Ooh-ooh-eah

I was secure and so glad there was you to love
What in the world would I ever do without us
But it's getting clear
That I have to get over you

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love

No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You, ooh-eah-eah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again
Do you know, tell me how
How to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you
To love you, girl
Ooh

To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl

// There's Nothing Better Than Love //

I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed that the night
And almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away
Oh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved

There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love
And I mean all these words I've said
And you don't have to guess
What's going on inside my head
Just try to know
All the things that our heart says
Listen to love and always
Get love to lead the way
Whenever you love

There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love

You know for love I'd go anywhere
(For love) I would go there
(For love, for love) For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love
(And for your love)
I would, I would, I would love
And I would love (would love)
To just spend all my time
With the girl who makes me
Feel her love is mine
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
And she'd be in love
Just because she'd wanna be
She'd wanna be loved

There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world
Could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

// I Really Didn't Mean It //

[Chorus:]
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it

[Verse 1:]
Out of my head to say the things I said
I didn't mean a word
Think jealousy just took a hold of me
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see
I can't face the world if she don't love me

[Chorus:]
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
When I walked away I cried (cried)
And I really didn't mean it
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)
Really didn't mean it

[Verse 2:]
Dear one from me take my apology
I need you back
I promise I know o never let you go
Is there a chance to see you baby
(They talk about all) the love that we still share
(From her emotion) I barely miss your happiness
(You're missing and mourning) the way it used to be
I know it's true but I don't believe

[Chorus:]
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)
And I really didn't mean it
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)
And I really didn't mean it
When I walked away I cried (cried)
And I really didn't mean it
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)
Really didn't mean it

[Hook:]
I want you back it can't be any other way
I want you back and I've waited for the day
I want you back I'm gonna be a little smarter
I want you back I'm gonna try a litte harder
She's good She's fine and always on my mind
I know our love will stand the test of time
She's my girl and my best friend
And I really didn't mean it
Her love is love so fine and so for real
I want the world to know the way I feel
She's my girl and my best friend
And I really didn't mean it
Yeah... yeah... oooh...

[Chorus: fade]

// Any Love //

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say,
"Oh my in a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy and
Now all you need is a chance to try any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out, hey
Are all those feelings that want to touch any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind, my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find any love, any love?

And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know there's a love waiting to enter my life, enter my life

Every day as I live, I try to think positive
And I, I pray for someone good to come, any love

Ooh, love is sweet and so divine
And I can't wait for my love life to shine, to shine
Can anybody tell me where I can find any love, any love?

And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know there's someone waiting for me
To enter my life, come into my life

Suddenly out of the clear, blue sky, lonely tears start to fill my eyes
I can weep, but I refuse to cry, I've got to keep holdin' on
I've got to be very strong, to keep holdin' on

Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know, I know, I know, I know now she'll come into my life
Into my, into my life

Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, any love yeah
And I need you, yeah should've been in my mind, in my mind
Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, ooh

// Love Won't Let Me Wait //

I need to have you next to me in more ways than one
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun

The time is right, you hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please tell me, 'Yes' and don't say, 'No'
Honey, not tonight

Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

Yeah, yeah

The time is right, turn down the lights
And take my hand, ooh, ooh, yeah
We'll take a flight and spend the night
In Wonderland

And I need to have you next to me in more ways than one
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun
Creep through your window pane
Because love won't let me wait
Not another minute

Ooh... ooh... ooh... yeah... yeah

And I need your love so desperately and only you can set me free
When I make love to you, we'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait

Love won't, no, no, no
Love won't, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
(Love won't let me wait)

Yeah... yeah
Love won't
I said

My baby
My temperature's risin', ooh

Not another minute
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me

Baby, baby
(I can't wait) I can't wait (I can't wait) I can't wait, I can't wait (I can't wait)
I can't wait, no, no, no, can't wait
(Wait) No way, no way, no, no, no, no
No way, no way, no, no
(Doo... ooh...) Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... yeah
(Wait) I can't wait not another minute
Not another minute (I can't wait, I can't wait) I'll be there (I can't wait) yes, I will
I'll be there
(Wait) Comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'
(Ooh... ooh...) I can't wait, can't wait
I can't wait, can't wait
No way, no way, no way, no, no
No, no, no, no
(Wait) Ooh... yeah... ooh... ooh
(I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait)
(Wait)

// If This World Were Mine //

If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine

I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give anything

If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine

I'd give your each day so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight

Baby (Baby)
Ooh...hoo...
It would be yours
If you'll believe

// Treat You Right //

I think I dream about you 
Most of the time. 
What can I say? Hey, Hey. 
But I don't see you much. 
It's only once in a while. 
I want to know what you feel. 
i used to hang around 
Being the toast of the town. 
But it's strange how your friends 
can sometimes let you fall down. 
But you 
And everyone in the world can see 
That I'm for real, honey. 
See, I don't know how to fool your heart. 
I just know what I know and what I know is. . . 
[Chorus:]
I will treat you right. 
Cause little darlin' 
You've got to be mine. 
I see your love light. 
We'll have a beautiful time. 
All night. 
I think about you; you're so fine. 
It just might work out 
If I treat you right. 
I want to keep you close to the heart. 
What can I say? Hey, hey. 
So I know, you will never ever, never go far. 
Cause I can feel if it's real. 
Though your friends say they still doubt me 
They don't know of the you I see. 
And I don't know how to do you wrong. 
I just know what I know and what I know is. . . 
[Chorus]
You and everyone in the world can see 
That I'm for real, honey. 
I don't know how to fool your heart. 
I just know what I know and what I know is. . . 
[Repeat Chorus and fade out]
