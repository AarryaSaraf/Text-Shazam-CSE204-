// Movin' On //

That big eighteen-wheeler, rollin' down the track
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin'on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, We're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin on

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on

// It's Not Love, But It's Not Bad //

He was always there each time I needed you,
Holding on to me like I held on to you
We still don't have what you and I once had
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad.
No, It's Not Love, not like our love  It's Not Love,
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who he's had
No, It's Not Love  But it's not bad

I turn to him when you leave me alone,
Sometimes even when you're here you're still gone.
He's slowly changing what you leave so sad
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad
No, It's Not Love, not like our love  It's Not Love,
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I don't have to wonder who he's had
No, It's Not Love  But it's not bad

No, It's Not Love  But it's not bad

// So Sad //

We use to have good times together dear
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad

Remember how you used to feel  dear
you said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
so sad to watch good love go bad

Is it any wonder that I'm feeling so blue
when I know for certain that I'm losing you
It breaks my heart to see us part
so sad to watch good love go bad

So sad to watch good love go bad

// Grievous Angel //

Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll tell you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
We flew straight across that river bridge,
Last night half past two
The switchman waved his lantern goodbye and good day as we
Went rolling through
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel
And now   I know just what I have to do
Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And headed out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down  down  down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

// Restless //

I don't belong to no one
I don't belong at all
Got my face in the corner
Got my back to the wall

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

I'm a hair trigger lover
And I can't face up to nothing
I'm impatient with the wind
But I'm waitin' here for somethin'

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

Restless sleep, twisted dreams
Moving targets, silent screams
Restless city, restless street
Restless you , restless me

I'm a face at the window
I'm a black satin sheet
And I can't stay warm
I stay out in the street

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

// Racing In The Street //

I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
>From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And  go racin' in the street
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street

He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels

Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street

// Long May You Run //

We've been through some things together
With trunks of memories still to come
We found things to do in stormy weather
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you run

Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run

Well it was back in Blind River in 1962
When I last saw you alive
Rollin' down that empty ocean road
Gettin' to the surf on time
Long may you run
Long may you run

Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Long may you run.
Long may you run.

Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run

// We'll Sweep Out The Ashes //

We know it's wrong  to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

Each time when we meet we both agree that it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

Yes we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

// Juanita //

No affection were the words that stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I don't know what I've done and I'm feeling so ashamed

Then an angel appeared she was just 17
In a dirty old town with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
She's brought back the life that I once threw away

// Devil In Disguise //

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Now a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can do without

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's alright to call her but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise
in disguise (in disguise) in disguise (in disguise)

// (Lost His Love) On Our Last Date //

It's over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more I'll share
Now he's gone I'm alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date

I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date

Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby's eye
Walked away didn't know that
I'd soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn't see
how much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last date

// Love's Gonna Live Here //

Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Thing's are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again

Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again

No more loneliness
Only happiness
Love's gonna live here again

I hear bells a ringing
I hear birds a singing
Love's gonna live here again

I hear bees a humming
And I know the days a coming
Love's gonna live here again
