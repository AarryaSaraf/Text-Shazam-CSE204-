Album: TheBalladOfSallyRose

// Ballad Of Sally Rose //

Her mama picked him up in south Minnesota
He promised her the world but they never got that far
For he was last seen in that '59 DeSota
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota

She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations

No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes
With bugs on her headlights
And runs in her hose
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose

They've got a national monument carved out of stone
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose

So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting tower

// Rhythm Guitar //

She played around town 'til she opened the show
For a high-rollin' singer up from Tupelo
He saw her in the lights and he give her a hand
Next thing Sally knew she was one of the band

She said "don't give me nothin' that I can't use
I got the rhythm and I do don't need the blues
I don't wanna ride no shootin' star
Just wanna play on the rhythm guitar"

She was the sweetest thing that he ever had seen
And he'd had quite a few of them backstage queens
She was the pretiest thing that he ever had heard
Playin' rhythm guitar and singin' the third

Well Sally keeps her feet planted on the ground
She don't lose her head when the sun goes down
Everybody's out lookin' for romance
But Sally just wants to get the people to dance

// I Think I Love Him //

I think I love him
I think I knew the first time
He called my name
And said you are my sunshine

I think I love him
I think I knew the hour
He held me close
And said you are my flower

// Heart To Heart //

Heart to heart we'll hold together
Hand in hand we'll find a way
Oh, the storms of life may blind us
But with the loving vows that bind us

Heart to heart hand in hand we'll stay
Side by side forever and always
Day by day till our lives are done
This sweet love is ours to treasure
Far beyond all time and measure
Side by side day by day as one
The years cannot take what's between you and me
We'll stand her together for the whole world to see

Heart to heart there'll be no other
Hand in hand for our love is true
Oh, the words that we have spoken
Will be a promise never broken
Heart to heart hand in hand with you

// Woman Walk The Line //

Don't bother sittin' at my table
Just because I'm on my own
Yes I'm a woman and I'm lonely
But that don't mean I can't be strong

Once again he's not  beside me
And tonight he won't be coming home
So I just need a place to miss my baby
When he goes out to do me wrong

Tonight I wanna do some drinkin'
I came to listen to the band
Yes I'm as good as what you're thinkin'
But I don't wanna hold your hand
And I know I'm lookin' lonely
But ther's nothin' here I wanna find
It's just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line

Every night's a little longer
Than the one that came before
But when I hear them sing a sad song
I know just what I'm cryin' for

I don't wanna stay home waitin'
Don't have to wonder where he's been
He'll be someone else's baby
Before he's in my arms again

// Bad News //

Bad news black day
Ther's been a wreck on the highway
Drivin' fast in distress
Hit a curve and died in the darkness

He'll never know how much I lose
Bad news
Bad news sirens whine
He rode the devil down the white line
Johnny Walker by his side
Always our there lookin' for the last ride

He'll never know how much I lose
Bad news

// Timberline //

Oh the stars they did shine
The night you swore that you'd be mine
And you promised always to be true
And to be kind
On that Shenandoah Hill
Where our love bloomed until
I went away and left those
Promises behind

But when I rise from the timberline
And call your name will you remember mine
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds
Like the wild, wild rose and the columbine

To that place I will go
Where the wildwood flowers grow
With a ribbon in my hair
And a grown of calico
To those Shenandoah Hills
I'll go back I swear I will
To the sweetest kiss my lips will ever know

// Long Tall Sally Rose //

Well tonight I'm gonna wear my dancin' shoes
'Cause I heard the word and I heard the news
Ther's a gal in town she's packin' 'em in
If you've seen her once, you'll see her again

She's got a red hot dynamite band
They're burnin' down another one-night stand
Headlinin' double shows
Everybody go see Sally Rose

She sure knows how to rock the crowd
Rocks 'em slow rocks 'em loud
So you better move fast 'cause tickets are tight
If you wanna see Sally Rose pick it tonight

// White Line //

It seems like I was there from the start
A witness to your wild and reckless heart
You showed me the way but now you're gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaw's gun
Living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me on

White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away

We worked the road as hard as we could drive her
But now I am the only survivor
From night to night at every place I play in
The sweetness of your song remains
I'll be the keeper of the flame
Til every soul hears what your heart was saying

White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away

All the nights you spent alone
All the love I'd never shown
All the words I could not say
Till that white line took you away
White line took you away
I'll follow this white line down where it's winding
Cause somewhere up ahead your light's still shining
The sound of the silver strings  will guide me
I've stood and watched the bridges burn
I'm past the point of no return
Oh how I wish that you were here beside me

// Diamond In My Crown //

As each long day rolls by and falls behind me
In the lonely night there's a peacefulness I've found
Tho' I'm weary even then
When I rise to start again

Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
I have wasted all that life has laid before me
I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown
But I shall not disavow
All these ties that bind me now

Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
Shinning down some day I know
Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down
And the sorrows I have known
I'll see them all be overthrown

Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
Through the passing of the years I will grow stronger
Just as sure as this old world keeps spinning 'round
Then the closer I will be
To my sweetest victory

Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

// Sweetheart Of The Rodeo //

I hear the sound of sorrow in the wind
Blowing down from every mile I've ever been
Calling me out on some road that just won't end
Where the sweetheart rides the rodeo again

A thousand nights a thousand towns I took the bows
But there is no compensation for me now
Out along the highway where the west was won
No matter how fast I ride or far I run

Waiting for the sweetheart of the rodeo
They're comin' down from Tonopah to Tupelo
She'll come to town to ride the radio
Like she's slidin' down the walls of Jericho
There goes the sweetheart of the rodeo

I stepped into the light you left behind
I stood there where all the world could see me shine
Oh I was on my way to you to make you mine
But I took the longest road that I could find

// K-S-O-S //

Come gather 'round me boys and lend an car
I've got some things I think you all should hear
It's time to shift into another gear
I've reached my final destination
Bought a radio station
And she's fifty thousand watts, pure and clear

K-S-O-S help is on the way
Twenty-four hours of every day
A voice in the wilderness
And we're here to stay
K-S-O-S

// Sweet Chariot //

Oh my darlin'
I have searched the desert and the sky
Just to find you
And take the mourning from my eyes
When I lost you
I suffered and you were sanctified
We are all born to live we are all bound to die

Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will afll and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow you'll carry me not
My heart is bound my soul is chained
To the rock
Rock of ages cleft for me
I swung down my hammer out in Joshua Tree
It rang on the mountain and rolled to the sea
And it will ring from the rock

Oh my children
Sorrow shall come to each of us
All our trials
Will soon lay buried in the dust
Long forgotten
But quick as silver turns to rust
Love is found when the heart is lost
