// Green Pastures //

Troubles and trials often betray those
On in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still waters
With the Good Shepherd leading The Way

Those who have strayed were sought by The Master
He who once gave His life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us to despair
Following on with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

// Evangeline //

She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight

They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin' the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Bayou Sam from South Louisian'
Had gamblin' in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin' insane

High on the top of a Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'
She watched that Queen go under

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

// If I Needed You //

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

Well the night's forlorn
And the morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
And that would break
My heart in two

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

Baby's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay
Her lilly
Hand in mine
Who would ill agree
She's a sight to see
A treasure for
The poor to find

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

// The Price I Pay //

They tell me I'm the talk of the town
I've been staying home alone every night
It's nobody's business where I'm bound
As if to be alone and lonely just ain't right

On a old freight train moving down the line
I'm counting each day and every minute that your away
I've never been the stay at home kind
But for you it's just the price that I pay

It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us

I knew I was in trouble when we met
Dark clouds all around me I couldn't find the light
The hard time ain't hard to forget
I believe in love at first sight

I put my heart and soul on the line
And know your love is with me every day
Your picture always there on my mind
But for you it's just the price that I pay

It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us

// Love Hurts //

Love hurts, love  scars, love  wounds and mars
Any heart not tough  or  strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud  holds a lot of rain
Love  hurts,  mmm,  mmm, love  hurts

I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts

// That Lovin' You Feelin' Again //

When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just  no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
It's really got me reeling  again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop  to start all over again  with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close  we were too far apart

I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday  haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try
This loving you feeling
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling  loving you
That loving you feeling again

// We Believe In Happy Endings //

Who can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile

We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside

We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I

Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done

And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love

We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside

We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe in happy endings
You and I

// Thing About You //

I'm not much on mystery
Yeah you gotta be careful what you dream
I thought this might pass with time
Yeah I thought I was satisfied

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I, got a thing about you

Somewhere deep in the middle of the night
Lovers hold each other tight
Whisper in their anxious ears
Words of love that disappear

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I, got a thing about you

Baby you hold some strange control over me
Yeah it's so wild it hypnotizes me

// Star Of Bethlehem //

Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness
Lingerin' on.

You might wonder who can I turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.

All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you,
They're only passing through you in the end.
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,
And wait for you to come back again.

You might wonder who I can turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.

From that lamp on down the hall.
Maybe the star of Bethlehem
Wasn't a star at all.

// All Fall Down //

Castles tall
Houses small
Left alone
All fall down

Dreams so clear
Disappear
Without a sound
All fall down

Lovers meet
Lovers quarrel
Lonely boy
Lonely girl

I lost him
And I have found
Dreams like walls
All fall down

All fall down
All fall down
She don't want me to call her
And she's told me not to bother comin' round
All fall down
All fall down
When you take a love for granted like I did
You're bound too see it all fall down

Castles tall
Houses small
Left alone
All fall down

Dreams so clear
Disappear
Without a sound
All fall down

// Wild Montana Skies //

He was born in the Bitteroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
Bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin'
the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:

Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
There was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone

But some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

// Gulf Coast Highway //

Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails
He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing we've owned is this old house here by the road

And when he dies he says he'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring

She walked through springtime when I was home
The days were sweet, our nights were warm
The seasons changed, the jobs would come
The flowers fade, and this old house felt so alone
When the work took me away

And when she dies she says she'll catch some blackbird's wing
And she will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring

Highway 90, the jobs are gone
We kept our garden, we set the sun
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow
And once a year they come and go
At this old house here by the road

And when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring

Yes when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away together
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
