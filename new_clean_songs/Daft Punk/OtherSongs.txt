She says I'm cold
Only time I'm comfortable kissing is sending X and Os
I send a message back to dispute this fact, but this I know
I hope to find my love, like we used to before dial-up
Whatever happened to our phone sex?
Right now, can't think of anything we don't text
I broke her heart on the email
I'm so cold, I'ma just spare y'all the details
I can't even tell y'all whats real
I got an iTouch, but I can't feel

Past was the word, now I'm living in the future

Start mackin' on my black berry
She got jealous I was tappin' on my Blackberry
So she didn't keep in touch
And I can't tell the difference
We ain't see each other much
Aside from some late night texts
A couple Os, a few Xs
My current feels just like my exes
Different characters, same letters
Red light, another message
Spilling her heart out, what a mess this is
P.S., this is B.S., I can't even spell it out
Am I that unaffectionate?

I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real

Past was the word, now I'm living in the future

She said it got better and worser
And it's supposed to be vice-versa
I don't know, I kinda like this surf stuff
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
We iChat, that's how she comes over
That's better than not seeing her
And I'm so glad I'm serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena
And we close, no matter how many miles between us
I told her, "Welcome to the future"
That's just how it is, I'm a user

// Derezzed (Avicii "So Amazing Mix") //

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh, let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

// The Grid //

The grid... 
a digital frontier...
I tried to picture, clusters of information,
as they move through the computer...
What did they look like?
Ships? Motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world, I thought I would never see...
And then... 
One day...
I got in...
