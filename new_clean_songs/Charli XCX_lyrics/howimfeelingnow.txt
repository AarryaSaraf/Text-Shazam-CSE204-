// pink diamond //

Yeah
Yeah

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

I just wanna go real hard
Lip gloss on and I'm lookin' like a star
Got a tiny bag, but I got a big heart
On the video chat, cute skirt and a bra
I'm feeling so fine, kinda feelin' like a slut
Gonna give you good views, watch me whip it up
I'm really so rare, I'm sent from above
Wish you could come 'round, pick me up in your car, yeah

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard (Real hard)
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

I just wanna go real hard for days (Days)
I just wanna feel in different ways (Ways)
Every single night kinda feels the same
I'm a pink diamond, I need space
I'm online and I'm feeling so glamorous (Ah)
Watch me shine for the boys and the cameras (Hey)
In real life, could the club even handle us? (Uh)
In real life, could the club even handle us?

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard (Real hard)
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Go real hard, I just wanna go real)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Go real-real hard-hard)
Yeah

I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard
Pink diamond in the dark
I just wanna go real hard, I just wanna go real hard

// forever //

Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head (In my head...)

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

Head, in my head

You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever (Ever)
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever (I know-I know)
I know in the future (Love you)
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

I know-I know (Love you)
Oh, I love, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, love you
I'll love you forever
I know-I know (Love you)
Oh, I love, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, love you
(I know-I know)
Future, we won't see each other
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you

Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, never leave you behind
We say promises and we gave up the lies
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front of my mind

Like your mind, like your smile

Aeroplane, you are so fly
Singin' songs by Jeremih

I'm not shy, make you sigh
Slip and slide up my thighs (Ah)
Juicy just like clementines
Sorry if I make you cry

// 7 years //

So hard, things that we've been through, yeah
Could've fallen, but we only grew, yeah (Uh)
So I made my house a home with you (Oh)
I'm right here and it feels brand new
I used to live inside a lie with you (With you)
And now we're honest and it feels so good (Ah, ah)

Hello, hello, hello, I see clearly
So long, been scared to show off my feelings
Hello, hello, hello, got new meanin'
Now I really see it

I know that look inside my eyes means always
Even if we fall apart, split two ways
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

Oh yeah, I really, really love you for life (For life)
Without the Holy matrimony, I'm wife (I'm wife)
We went from distant to inseparable types (That's right)
Oh yeah, it's really, really, really, really nice (It's really nice)
And now I never, ever, ever think twice (Not twice)
'Cause you're exactly really, really my type (My type)
I think we took some sleeping pills on that flight (That flight)
The seven years, it really, really flown by (Swoosh)

I know that look inside my eyes means always (Always)
Even if we fall apart, split two ways (Two ways)
Used to be afraid to say it, that's so strange
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
Really complicated, we're too deep, babe (Deep, babe)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane (Me insane)
Used to be afraid to say it, now that's changed
Seven years and it's been you and I, always

Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no

(Always)
(Always) Yeah
(Now that's changed) Oh
I know that look inside my eyes means always
Even if we fall apart, split two ways (Now, now)
Yeah, that's so strange, always, yeah (Always)
I know that look inside my eyes means deep pain (So strange)
Really sad, the way our song drives me insane
(Now, now) Ooh
(No way) Oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah (So strange)
I, always (No way)
(Now that's changed) Ooh
(No, no, no way)
Seven years and it's been you and I, always (Always)
(So strange)
No, oh

// detonate //

Close myself off in new ways
Building walls in my sleep, I can't turn back
I've been reelin' for twelve days (Twelve)
When I start to see if it gets real bad

Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone

I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

I'm not tryna be rude
I'm just feelin' confused
My emotions get blue
Had to push 'em all through
Know you hope that I'll prove
Everything will stay cool
But I can't promise that's true
'Cause my emotions so blue

Hurt me, know you won't hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone
Sorry, never say sorry
All my silence resonates
Think you worked me out, but you're wrong
Dirty, I can talk dirty
I can make you feel so sick
Switch your faith and leave you so low
Hurt me, know you'll never hurt me
I'm about to detonate
Pull you close, and then, I'll be gone

I don't trust myself at all
Why should you trust me?
I don't trust myself alone
Why should you love me?

Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
So do you love me?
Do-do-do-do you love me?
Why should you love me?

// enemy //

They say, "Keep your friends close"
But you're closer, I love when you're here
I'm so far away sometimes, I'm distant, yeah
You might help me, intimacy, I'll admit, I'm scared
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Suddenly, you're in my bedroom under my sheets every night
Suddenly, I lose my fear, it feels good, yeah
I feel guilty, I feel nervous, I feel certain now
Maybe, maybe you can reach me, yeah

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Oh, yeah
Yeah, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

So calm at the surface
I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous
Can you reach me?
So calm at the surface
Told you I'm scared of nothin'
Underneath, I'm nervous, yeah
Can you reach me?

I think a tough journey to be on
Whilst you're around a lot of people
I feel like I'm learning that about myself
And I don't fully really understand it yet
It hurts here, it like hurts here

Maybe you're my enemy
Now I've finally let you come a little close to me, oh
Maybe you're my enemy
You're the only one who knows the way I really feel, oh
Now it's really clear to me
You could do a little damage, you could cut me deeper
Maybe you're my enemy
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah

Can you reach me?
Maybe you're my enemy
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?
Baby, you're my enemy, yeah
Can you reach me?

I seem to think that I'm a really bad person

// i finally understand //

Oh
Oh, oh
Baby, lately
Baby, yeah

The walls are all gone, did we melt 'em down? (Baby)
Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth (Oh)
Footage on my phone, did it with your tongue (Oh)
And now we're sticking close, and I understand

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

I finally understand, finally understand
My therapist said I hate myself really bad
You tell me it's fine, let me cry and hug it out

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

'Cause lately

Liquid in my hands, liquid in my mouth
Got me drippin' out, got me drippin' out
Many nights gone, finally understand
I finally understand, I finally understand
Feel it in my core and the feeling's raw
You love me even when I hate myself, I'm sure

That baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground
Baby, I love you bad
'Cause lately, I finally understand
That maybe this feeling that I've found
Might kill me, put me in the ground

Baby

White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window
Phone calls every night, had a new glow
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow
We were so in love, so we let go
Took it in our lungs, then we all choked
Long drive, so divine when the sun showed
My clique running through my mind like a rainbow

I miss them every night
I miss them by my side
Catch my tears when I cry
My clique on me for life
Driving 'round at dawn, look at you, lip bite
Something in my chest, feel the tension breaks
Want to stand still, won't forget this time
I miss them, I miss them, I miss them

White sheets, you and me used to lay close
Blue summer, sittin' high in the window

// anthems //

Hello

I'm so bored (Woo)
Wake up late, eat some cereal
Try my best to be physical
Lose myself in a TV show
Staring out to oblivion
All my friends are invisible
Twenty-four seven, miss 'em all
I might cry like a waterfall
I feel afraid when I feel alone, yeah, uh
Have sex, me and my Romeo
He says I'm irresistible
I'm gassed up like I'm Texaco
I ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride it
Sometimes, I feel okay, some days, I'm so frightened

I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (You)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh
These days exhausting
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Go online shopping
I'm so uninspired, I just wanna breathe
Flowers and the trees, dirt all on my knees
Got some hands to hold on to
I get existential and so strange
I hear no sounds when I'm shouting
I just wanna go to parties
Up high, wanna feel the heat from all the bodies

I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (You)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
We might, we might, we might, we might, we might
Yeah

I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
I sleep, wanna wake up brand new
I sleep, wanna wake up with you (You)
I want anthems
Late nights, my friends, New York
Finally, when it's over
We might be even closer, uh, uh

// visions //

Visions in the past
Turbulence right from the start
Tearing up your heart
You and I, we really went dark

Voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
I see you
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, and it looks so right
I see you

Can't change what I feel
Never seen the future so real
But maybe I'm just fantasizing
Finally think I'm realizing

All these voices tell me hold on
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close
Grippin' to you so hard
Somethin' keeps on pullin' me close, so close, but

I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all so bright
I got pictures in my mind
I can see it so clearly, see it all the time
Visions comin' every night
You can call me so crazy, following that light
I see you and I
I got pictures in my mind

I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
I got pictures in my mind
