// Lady (You Bring Me Up) //

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down
Maybe you're gonna change my life around

You came to me when I was lonely 
And no one cared
You made me see that I was only 
Just running scared

I saw your face and something told me
You were the one
You smiled at me and now I see
My life's begun

Lady (Pretty lady), you bring me up when I'm down
(Up when I'm down)
Maybe you're gonna change my life around
(Gonna change my life around, yeah)
Lady, you brought me in from out the rain (Yeah)
Maybe my life will never be the same

Once I was filled with desperation
A solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration
Like only true love can

Now I believe in what you're saying
I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explaining
We've got it all

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Maybe) you're gonna change my life around

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Yeah) you're gonna change my life around
(You're gonna change my life around)
Lady (Pretty lady), you brought me in from out the rain
Maybe my life will never be the same
(It'll never be the same, yeah)
Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Maybe) you're gonna change my life around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, lady)

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down
Maybe you're gonna change my life around

Lady...

// Saturday Night //

Saturday, but I've been living for the weekend, girl
To let all my inhibitions go wild, wild and free
Gonna get away into the night
Take the girl of my dreams
Don't you know we'll make sweet music?

Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right, whoo whoo

Girl, forget the memories of those bad times together
Let us live at love and make these moments unforgettable
Tonight will be full of ecstasy
'Cause it's Saturday night in our lives again

Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Ooh

Tonight will be full of ecstasy
'Cause it's Saturday night in our lives again

Yeah, it's alright
(Saturday, Saturday night)
When it's Saturday, it's alright, yeah
(Saturday, Saturday night)
(Saturday)
Feels so good on a Saturday (Saturday) Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Saturday (Saturday) Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right

// Oh No //

I want you to want me
I'm goin' crazy knowin' he will be your lover tonight
And when he comes I'll let you go
I'll just pretend as you walk out the door

Oh, no
I can't sleep
Oh, no
I'm goin' crazy with love over you

I need you to need me
I wanna hold you but you're holdin' someone else in your arms
When I close my eyes I see your face
I'm just not sure how much my heart can erase

Oh, no
I can't think, ooh
Oh, no
I'm goin' crazy with love over you

Oh, honey
Oh, sugar

Oh, no
I can't sleep anymore, baby
Oh, no
I can't think anymore, baby
Oh, no
I'm goin' crazy with love over you

// Why You Wanna Try Me //

Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way (Oh, oh)
Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way (Whoa)

So many nights, so many days, baby
I've been hurt by your love
I don't know why I still love you like I do, baby
But you're a star in my world

Oh, how you got down and lonely
Ooh, yeah, my heart is in your hands
I don't see why you won't let me
When you know I'll be your number one man, yeah

Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way
Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way (Ooh)

Tell me, yeah
Oh, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I wanna know just how you feel about me
I can't pretend anymore
My love for you just keeps on gettin' strong
Don't make me walk out the door

This can't go on forever
We've played this love game too long
I've tried my best to understand you
Please love me, girl, and don't do me wrong

Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way
Why you wanna try me, baby
When I'm the one you want
Just tell me where I am

Ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, tell me

Why you wanna try me (Whoa, yeah)

// Lucy //

Hey Lucy why don't you come and settle down 
I hear you're the baddest girl this side of town 
Got a little money that I wanna spend 
If you'll be my friend 
For just a little while 

First summer you sailed on down to New Orleans 
I was a victor, you were a Cajun queen 
You had many fellas with lots of style 
And you drove them wild 
Oh little Lucy I had to be with you 

Traveled around the country 
Oh and I made my way 
I never once forgot what I felt that day 
Now I think I'm ready to play my hand 
I wanna be your man which is hard to do 
Oh Lucy I'm so in love with you 

I've been a wandering man for such a long time 
Now I know just where I'm going 
Oh how I need you to stand by my side 
Don't you go away 
Cause I'm so in love with you 

I've been searchin' for you Lucy for such a long time 
Now I wanna let you know what I have on my mind 
You've been around a lonely man 
A lonely man 
I've been a lonely man 
Lucy 
I don't want to live my life without you 
There were times when I tried to get you off my mind girl 
You're the girl of my dreams 
Oh you're the girl of my dreams 
Lucy 
(Ahh my Lucy) 
So many lonely nights I need you girl 
(Ahh my Lucy)
