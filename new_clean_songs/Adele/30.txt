Album: 30

// Strangers By Nature //

I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood a chance as if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

I've never seen the sky this colour before
It's like I'm noticing everything a little bit more
Now that all the dust has settled
I rebut all my rebuttals
No one knows what it's like to be us

Strangers by nature
Strangers by nature

Will I ever get there?
Oh, I hope that someday I'll learn
To nurture what I've done

Uh, huh, hm
Uh, huh, hm, hm, hm
Uh, huh, hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Alright then, I'm ready

// Easy On Me //

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

// My Little Love //

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

- Tell me you love me
- I love you a million percent

I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

- Oi, I feel like you don't love me
- Why do you feel like that?
- Do you like me?
- You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

- Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
- Like how?
- Just, like, mummy, I'm, I'm, the feeling that I have. Like, um, I feel a bit confused
- Why?
- I don't know. And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
- Oh, at all?
- At all
- And that would make me go...

My little love
Tell me, do you, you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

- I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me. You're half me and you're half daddy
- Oh

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that, but I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot

// Cry Your Heart Out //

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I walk in a room I'm invisible, I feel like a ghost (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
All my friends keep on telling me that this feeling won't last (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I have nothing to feel no more
I can't even cry (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I wake up I'm afraid at the idea of facing the day
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away
Please stop calling me, it's exhausting
There's really nothing left to say
I created this storm
It's only fair I have to sit in its rain

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

All love is devout
No feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now
Before it's too late
In the end it's just you
Stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

Cry your heart out (Cry, yeah)
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

// Oh My God //

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, Lord)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Don't let me let myself down)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, my God)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)

// Can I Get It //

Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home

Throw me to the water (Water, water)
I don't care how deep or shallow (Water)
Because my heart can pound like thunder (Water)
And your love, and your love can set me free

I have promised I will love you till the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine

So can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

You tease me with your control
Because I long to live under your spell
And without your love I'm hollow
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own

I have promised I will love you till the end of time (End of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine (The divine)
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mm, mm-mm)
All I want is for you to be mine

So can I get it right now? Mm
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

When will you run with me
Like I know you want to?
(Like you want to, like you want)
You're the one for me
And I'm counting on you
To put the pieces of me back together

So can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

// I Drink Wine //

How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me

Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find (We'll both find), peace of mind
Sometimes, the road less traveled is a road best left behind

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There were just memories in a big storm

// All Night Parking //

I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just want to spend all my time with you (Feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress
Don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party
I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (Like oh my God)
It's so hard to digest
Usually I'm best alone
But every time that you text
I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long

Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And then some)
The sight of you is dramatic
One glimpse and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours
'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you
All night long

All night long
All night

// Woman Like Me //

You're driving me away
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you
But not in this way

I don't think you quite understand
Who you have on your hands
How can you not see
Just how good for you I am?

I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in
'Cause I only want to be the cure

If you don't choose to grow
We ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

All you do is complain
About decisions you make
How can I help lift you
If you refuse to activate
The life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place
But you will never give it up

It's where they make you feel powerful
That's why you think I make you feel small
But that's your projection
It's not my rejection

I put my heart on the line
For the very first time
Because you asked me to
And now you've gone and changed your mind

But loving you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get
The love I have for you
'Cause you don't care
Uh hmm

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

A woman like me
(One more time)

Complacency (Woman like me) is the worst trait to have (Woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me (Woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (Woman like me)
Consistency (Woman like me) is the gift to give for free
And it is key...

// Hold On //

Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold onto who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win

Hold on
Let time be patient
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now I truly hate being me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

Just hold on (Just hold on)
Let time be patient (You)
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious (Love will soon come)
Just hold on (You, just hold on, you, just hold on), hold on (You, just hold on, just hold on)

Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get (Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness actually let's us forget (Just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret (Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

So just hold on (Just hold on)
Let time be patient (You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come, baby
If you just hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (Hold on)
Just let time be patient
'Cause you're still strong, you're still strong (You are still strong)
Just be gracious
'Cause love will soon come
If you just hold on (You, just hold on, you, just just hold on, you, just hold on)
Just be patient, just be patient
(You, just hold on, you, just just hold on, you, just hold on, you, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

// To Be Loved //

I built a house for love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

I'm so afraid but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Trying to learn to lean in to it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe 'til the time feels right

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried

// Love Is A Game //

All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely you know, that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see, ee-ee, ee-ee

That love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall, for the lies that I tell? (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell? (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (It's inevitable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

When love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love, can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah)

I can love, I can love again
I love me now, like I love him
I'm a fool for that
You know I, you know I'm gonna do it
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'd do it all again like I did it

// Wild Wild West //

I grew a nipper in the wild wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild wild west
I was galivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow catching in the wilderness

Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

Now I'm cutting shines in the wild wild west
I had to bed my man down to save my self
That's when I, I got churched in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress

From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go

// Can't Be Together //

You've got your eye on me after all these years
You think that I can't see you from over here
I may be out of your view but I can hear you
I may be out of the room but I can see you
I know you still want me, you always will
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I would still do anything for you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

I was far too reckless, I know that now
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out
But know that I live with my doubt

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I want to do everything with you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

Since we were together everybody's changed
Our reflections in the mirror no longer look the same
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make
But I will always miss you at the end of each day

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

But we can't be together
No, we won't be together

// Easy On Me (Duet Version) //

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
