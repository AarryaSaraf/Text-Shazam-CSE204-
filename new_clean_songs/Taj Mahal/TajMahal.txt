// Leaving Trunk //

I went upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk
I ain't see no blues, whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I ain't never seen no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
I'm going back to Memphis babe, where I'll have much better luck

Lookout Mama you know you asked me to be your King
She said you kiddin' man, if you want it, keep it hid
But please don't let my husband, my main man catch you here
Please, don't let my main man, my husband catch you here

The blues are mushed up into three different ways
One said go, the other two said stay
I woke up this mornin' with the blues three different ways
You know one say go "baby I want to hang up", the other two said stay

Wake up mama I got something to tell you
You know I'm a man who love to sing the blues
Now you got to wake up baby, mama now, I got something; I got something to tell you
Well, you know I'm the man, I'm the man oh yes and I love to sing the blues

Come on baby, come on!

I went upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk, you know
I ain't see no blues or whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I ain't never seen no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
I go home baby and I lay down on the lawn

// Statesboro Blues //

Yes now, wake up, mama, turn your lamp down low
Wake up, mama, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve drive Papa Taj from your door?

Woke up in the morning, baby, I had them Statesboro Blues
Statesboro, Georgia that is
Woke up this morning had them Statesboro Blues
I looked over in the corner, grandma baby had 'em too

Mama died and left me reckless, papa died and left me wild
I ain't good lookin' baby but I'm someone's sweet angel-child
Goin' to the country, baby do you want to go
I know if you can't make it, your sister Lucille said she want to go

You know I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
Yes, I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
She treat me like a king
I treat her like she, she was a dog gone queen

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve drive Papa Taj from your door?

// Everybody's Got To Change Sometime //

Change in the ocean, change in deep blue sea
Well, there's a change in my baby, but there ain't never no change in me
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later, mama, you gonna end up in some lonesome ground

Now, change my shirt, you know, and I change my money

Change in the mountain, you know, change in the land
But there ain't never no change in me, baby, 'cause I'm a natural man
You know, yeah, everybody ought to change sometime
Because if they don't change, they gonna end up in in that lonesome ground

Yeah, there's a change in the ocean, change in the deep blue sea
Well, there's a change in my baby, but there ain't never no change in me
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
'Cause you know, sooner or later, you gonna end up in a lonesome ground

You know my friends can have my room

// Diving Duck Blues //

If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up

If you were a good woman
I would never have to roam
If you were a good woman
I would never have to roam
I'd give up drinking whiskey and I would always stay at home

River go to the ocean, ocean go to the sea
Why you ain't no good woman
A mystery to me
River go to the ocean, ocean go to the sea
And like a fish has got to swim, you've got to make a fool out of me

If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up
