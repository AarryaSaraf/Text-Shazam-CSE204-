// Blackjack Davey //

Blackjack Davey come a ridin' through the woods
Singin' him a song so gayly
Well he played and he sang
'Til the green woods rang
And he charmed the heart of a lady
He charmed the heart of a lady
He charmed the heart of a lady

Oh, won't you come along and be my pretty little missy
Come along and be my lady
She say, Ha! You know I know it's right
I'm gonna sleep on the ground tonight
With my man Blackjack Davey
With my man Blackjack Davey
Oh, with my man Blackjack Davey

Who gonna shoe your pretty little feet now?
Who gonna rub your head?
Who gonna kiss your ruby red lips
When I'm some long distant land, baby
When I'm some long distant land
When I'm a long distant land

She say Papa gonna shoe my pretty little feet now
Sister gonna rub my head
I will live in my mama's house
And I will not need no spouse
When you're in your long distant land, baby
When you're in your long distant land, baby
When you're in your long distant land

What did he do?
He soothed her with his music
He soothed her with his song
He sung 'til he was nearly crazy
She said ha! You know I know it's right
But I'm gonna sleep on the ground tonight
With my man Blackjack Davey
With my man Blackjack Davey
Oh, with my man Blackjack Davey

Ride, Chile, Ride

// Great Big Boat //

Me and my baby and that great big boat
Gonna sail down the coast of Mexico
Take a slow ride through the Panama Canal
Come out in the Caribbean

Sun may shine and that wind may blow
Sails billowing as we go
Rolling down over the waves
Come out in the Caribbean

I love you baby, you know I do
Anything in the world for you
Sailing at night amongst the stars
Come out in the Caribbean...

The wind will blow
Down the coast of Mexico
Gulf of Tehuanapequa
Come out in the Caribbean

I love my baby, you know I do
Anything in the world for you
[?]
Come out in the Caribbean

Me and my baby and that great big boat
Gonna sail down the coast of Mexico
Take a slow ride through the Panama Canal
Come out in the Caribbean...

// Baby You're My Destiny //

Oh, I'm in love you
And, baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny
Oh, my darling, oh, my baby
I'm thrilled
And I always will
'Cause baby, you said yes to me
You really yes to me
And I look into the sky
'Cause babe, you like to mess with me
You really mess-a-mess-a-mess with me

In your heart
So deep a love I know
And your love, baby
Surely will grow and grow and grow
And grow and grow and grow

Ooh, lovin' you
Is all I really want to do
Baby, you my destiny
My brilliant destiny
And you know, and you know you can cook
Cooky-cooky-cooky-cook
Baby won't you cooky-cooky, cooky-cook for me
You cooky-cook for me
And you know that you
You know what you do, baby
To really get the juicy part of me
The ooy-gooy part of me

Baby now, in your heart
So deep a love I feel
And this time, I know, I know
That this love is real-real, real-real
But you're not real-real-real-real

Ooh, baby-baby, you
Baby-baby, baby-baby, you
Ma-ma-ma, baby you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny
And I, I lovin' you
And you know the reason why
'Cause baby, you my destiny
My brilliant destiny
But you are around me
Like the circle
Not the sun
Won't you do me, do me, do me
Like my evening
Like a [?]
Baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny

Ooh, I'm in love with you
And baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny...

Destiny...

// All Along The Watchtower //

"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
No one of them along the line know what any of it is worth"

"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women, women came and went, with the barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl
