// The Calypsonians //

The Calypsonians were all gathered together, singing such a mournful tune
I don't know if it was in the summer time could be the month of May or June
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

I do believe down to my soul I'm going to take accross the deep blue sea
Like my friend Carlos on the Hokule'a down to old Fiji
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

Love me baby, baby love me, love me baby thru and thru
Love me in the night time, darling from moon to moon
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

If you love me like you say you love me, love like you say you do
Love me in the sunshine, darling from moon to moon
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

The blues chaed up a rabbit, rabbit run a quarter mile
That poor little furry bunny scared like a little child
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

The Calypsonians were all gathered together, singing such a mournful tune
I don't know if it was in the summer time could be the month of May or June
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

// Betty And Dupree //

Betty told Dupree she wanna diamond ring
Betty told Dupree she wanna diamond ring
Dupree told Betty: Baby, I'll buy you anything

Dupree told Betty: Baby, won't you be my wife
Dupree told Betty: Baby, won't you be my wife
She said, "I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, for the rest of my life"

Put your arms around me, baby, honey, like a circle around the sun
Put your arms around me, baby, like a circle around the sun
Put your big strong arms around my waist, let it slide down on the one

Love me, baby, love me to the bone
Won't you love me, baby, honey, love me deep down in my bones
I will love you so good, that you can't stand to leave me alone

Kiss me, baby, right on my ruby lips
Kiss me, baby, honey, on my ruby lips
Put your big strong arms around my waist, and let it slide down on my hips

Yeah, yeah, Betty told Dupree, she wanna diamond ring
Betty told Dupree, she wanna diamond ring
And Dupree said: Betty, I'm gonna buy you anything

// Mailbox Blues //

Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it baby
Paint some trailin' vines and dew

You know I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog's got me down
I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog has got me down
I'm goin' up to the canyon
Where there ain't nobody else around

Come here baby
Mama, let me take you, take you by yo' hand
Come here baby
Mama, let daddy take you by yo' hand
You be my woman
And I will be your city-boy, country man

I'm gonna move up to the country
Gonna paint, gonna paint, gonna paint, my mailbox blue
Move up to the country
Gonna paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it honey
Paint some trailin' vines and dew
