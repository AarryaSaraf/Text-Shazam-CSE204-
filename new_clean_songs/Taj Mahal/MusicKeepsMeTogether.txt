// West Indian Revelation //

I spent last summer on an island, in the Mediterreannean Sea
The sunshine was so bright, yes, you know it burned me down to my soul
I wish everybody that I had to love was there with me
What a time, baby, what a time, I had when I was there

First I'm an African man, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

First I'm black African, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

First I'm an African man, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it let your body swim
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it, baby, take a pull of rum again
If you have not had enough of it in your life, you just cannot have your fill

First I'm black African, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

// My Ancestors //

My ancestors
Were kings of old
Hey, they ruled the world
And all of its gold
You can look at me
Hey, yeah, look at me
Yeah, yeah, look at me
Uh

My ancestors
Would fight the sun
Before they bowed down
To anyone
You have to look at me
Hey yeah, look at me
Ah, look at me
Ooh, look at me
I'm a stranger in this land
Well, watch me grow tall
Oh, help me to be a man
Hey
Hey, yeah!

My ancestors
They were mighty men
Yeah, and my son, he will be one of them
And people will look at him
Oh, hey, look at him
Oh, hey, look at him
And say he's a man
Oh, he's a man
My son's a man

My ancestors
They pushed it on to me, oh
They pushed it on to me, oh
Oh, and I'm gonna push it on to you
And then my son will be a man
A man
My son will be a man
Ooh
Oh yeah

// Brown Eyed Handsome Man //

Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man
