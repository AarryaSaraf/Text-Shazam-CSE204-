// God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind) //

Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel were to multiply
Why must any of the children, why must they die?
So he asked the Lord, and the Lord said:
Man means nothing, he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
Chases 'round the desert
'Cause he thinks that's where I'll be
And uh, that's why I love mankind
I recoil in horror from the foulness of Thee
Oh, from the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven at the prayers you offer me
And that's why I love mankind
Oh, oh

The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree, yeah
The Buddhists and the Hindus
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined in on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
And they said: "Lord, a plague is on the world (Oh)
Lord, no man is free (Oh)
The temples that we built to you (Oh)
Have tumbled down, fell into the sea" (Oh)
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Please, please let us be?
And the Lord said (The Lord said)
And the Lord said (And the Lord said)
He said:
I burn down your cities, how blind you must be, ha
I take you, your children, and say how blessed are we
Now you must all be crazy to put your faith in me

And that's why I love mankind
You really need me
That's why I love, I love mankind

// Down So Low //

When you went away I cried for so long
I wanted you to stay but that was all wrong
The pain you left my behind has become a part of me
And it's burned that hole where my love used to be

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

And I know, I know I love you but that wasn't good enough
We both fell apart when the going got real rough
I've learned how to give now but what good does it do
But no one can touch me like you used to do

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

I know your opinion of me isn't good
Please try to understand that I'd change, I'd change if I could
This coldness inside of me, lord it's starting to build
And a woman isn't a woman until she's fulfilled

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

I know no one can

// Leave Your Hat On //

Baby, take off your coat...real slow
Baby, take off your shoes...here, I'll take your shoes
Baby, take off that mess...
Heh yes, yes, yes
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
Ow...mmm'go on over there, turn on the light...no, all the lights
Come back here, stand on this chair...heh that's right
Raise your arms up, up in the air and uh...shake 'em
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to...oh-owww
You give me reason to live
Suspicious minds are talking
Trying to tear us apart
They say that my love is wrong
They don't know what love is...
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
But I-I-I-I-I-I...I know what love is

// Sail Away //

In America you get food to eat
Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet
No, you just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American

Ain't no lions or tigers, ain't no mamba snakes
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake
Everybody is happy as a man, as a man can be
Climb aboard, little wog, sail away with me

Now c'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

In America every man is free
To take care of his home and his family
You'll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree
You're all gonna be an, an American

Now c'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
C'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

Sail away, sail away, sail away
We will cross Charleston Bay
Now sail away, sail away, sail away
We gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

Sail away, sail away
We gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away
We gonna cross it, we gonna cross that bay
Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away, sail, sail
