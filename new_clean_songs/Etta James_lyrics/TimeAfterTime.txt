Album: TimeAfterTime

// Don't Go To Strangers //

Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me

For when you hear a call
To follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been through it all
And I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling
Come on to me

// Teach Me Tonight //

Did you say, I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love

Graduation's almost here, my love
So would you teach me tonight
I must not fail, my love
Teach me tonight

// Love Is Here To Stay //

It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year
But ever and a day

The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way

In time the rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay but
Our love is here to stay

The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way

In time the rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay but
Our love is here to
Our love is here to
Our love is here to stay

// The Nearness Of You //

It's not the pale moon that excites me, that thrills and delights me
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you
Isn't your sweet conversation that brings this sensation
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

When I'm in your arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wondrous dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me if you only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you

I need no soft lights to enchant me if you will only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you

// Time After Time //

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

// My Funny Valentine //

My funny Valentine
Sweet, comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay
And each day will be Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Don't, please don't change a hair for me
Not if, not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
And each day will be Valentine's
Every day will be, every day will be Valentine's Day

// Ev'ry Body Somebody's Fool //

The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

'Coz everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I've told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool at least I know the score
Yet darlin' I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I'd come runnin' back for more

'Coz everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I cry for you

Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

// Willow Weep For Me //

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me

Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Left my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide its starry light
So none will see me sighing and crying all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

Oh, Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

// Imagination //

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
"What to do, what to do?"

Have you ever felt
A gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine
That you want me, too

// Night And Day //

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day, day and night

Why is it so that this longing for you
Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you spent my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

// Someone To Watch Over Me //

There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his inital to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know i could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some 
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me
