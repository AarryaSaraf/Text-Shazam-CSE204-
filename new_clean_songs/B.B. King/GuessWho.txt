Album: GuessWho

// Guess Who //

Someone really loves you
Guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who
S'open your heart,
Oh, then surely you'll see,
Oh, that the someone who really cares is me

Someone will wait eternally
Someone who'll want your love,
Oh so desp'rately
Open your heart,
Oh, then surely you'll see,
Oh, that the someone who really cares,
Who really cares is me

// Five Long Years //

If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talking about.
If you ever been mistreated people, you know just what I'm talking about.
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
And she had the nerve to put me out. 

You know I got a job in a steel mill, trucking steel like a slave. 
Five long years, every Friday I went straight home with all of my pay. 
If you ever been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about.
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
And she had the nerve to put me out. 

But you know, I finally learned a lesson, a long, long time ago. 
The next woman that I marry, she gotta work and bring in the dough. 
If you been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about. 
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
She had the nerve, she had the nerve to put me out.
