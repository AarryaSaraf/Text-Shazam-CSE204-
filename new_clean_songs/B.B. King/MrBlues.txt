// Chains Of Love //

Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well, now I'm just a prisoner
Tell me what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna leave me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
Are you gonna love me?
Are you gonna make me cry?
These chains of blues gonna haunt me
Until the day I die

Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free?
I can't stay here with these chains
Unless you gonna stay right here with me

It's three o'clock in the morning, baby
And the moon is shining bright
Yes, it's three o'clock in the morning
And the moon is shining bright
I'm just sittin' here wonderin'
Where can you be tonight?

// Blues At Midnight //

When that midnight hour went chiming,
I was in my room alone
Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming,
I was in my room alone
Yes, and when I came home this evening,
I found my baby gone

Oh, I laid my head on my pillow,
I gazed up at the stars up above
Yes, I laid my head on my pillow,
yes, lookin' up at the stars above
I tell you it's a miserable feeling,
oh, when you lose the one you love

Oh, I get the blues at midnight,
oh there's one thing I can't describe
Oh, I get the blues at midnight,
oh there's one thing I can't describe
Yes, and when you look at your baby's picture
oh, the tears will come from your eyes

// Sneakin' Around //

Well hello pretty baby
I just called to say that we're through
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

I want to meet you in the sunlight
Not in a secret rendezvous
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

Oh you never, you're never meant to be mine
I was just too blind to see
Oh but I've got my pride, so why should we hide
When you might as well be free

Oh I love, you know I love you
Oh, and I want to tell the world I do
That's why I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh, I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

// My Baby's Comin' Home //

I've lost the blues there's nothing else to lose 
I'm gonna count my twos I'm takin off my shoes 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
When I first heard this boy, I did the twist 
My baby's comin home 

The things I did before that made her go 
I ain't doin no more and I'm telling you so 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
when I first got her wire boy I thought I would die 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 

Im meatin allmy planess i'm meatin all my trains 
I'm checkin on the bus boy I'm kickin up a fuss
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
if she was comin back to you boy you'd be a fool too 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 

I ain't had what it take to make me shake 
I'm bout to get a break and lose this ole ache 
My baby's comin home, my baby's comin home 
I'm gonna change my ways i'll be busy for days 
My baby's comin home

// You Ask Me //

Yes, you ask me
If I love you
If I'm true to you, each day
Well darling, if I didn't love you
Why would I be this why way

Oh, you ask me
If our love will die
Or will it forever grow
Well, I love you, yes darling, I love you
More than you'll ever know

Oh, I'm on my knees
I'm begging you, please
Oh, to ease my worried mind
Can't you see
Can't you see, pretty baby, what you mean to me
Love is so hard to find

Yes, you ask me
To prove my love
Oh, and everything I say and do
Yes, believe me, please believe me
I'll never love no one but you
Oh, I'll never love, never love, never love no one but you

// I'm Gonna Sit In 'til You Give In //

Ever since the world begin 
Man have received the right to live from god above 
But there is only right that you can give 
That is the right for me to have your love 

That's why I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
That's why I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

No use resisting i'll keep insisting 
Stop your conniving girl I aint jiving 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

No use resisting i'll keep insisting 
Stop your conniving girl I aint jiving 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Night time day time sunshine or rain 
I'll be ridin that freedom train 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Tonight at eight in the morning at four 
You'll find me sitting at your front door 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love 

Tonight at eight in the morning at four 
You'll find me sitting at your front door 
I'm gonna sit in till you give in 
And give me all your love
