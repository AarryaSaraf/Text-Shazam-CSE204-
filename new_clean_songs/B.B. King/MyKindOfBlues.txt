Album: MyKindOfBlues

// Someday Baby //

Don't care when you go
How long you stay
But good kind treatments
Will bring you back someday
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Aw, but one thing
Really give me the blues
When I wore a hole
In my last pair of shoes
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Just keep on a-bettin'
About the...
You're gonna leave here runnin'
Almost too fast
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Don't like everybody
In my neighborhood
I got a no-good woman
She don't mean me no good
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

// You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now //

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Well the way I used to love you baby
Baby that's the way I hate you now

You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
You used to say that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
Well I don't blame you baby
Because you ain't what you used to be

Let me love you just one more time
Yes let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh, let me love you, let me love you, let me love you 
One more time baby
Let me love you just one more time anyway
Oh you can't quit me now baby
Because you didn't mean me no good anyway

Well you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes you know where I'm from baby
So please don't try to mistreat me
Yes because I'll make your mother a present
Baby of you and your casket too

Oh you once said you loved me
And you would do anything I said
Oh you once said you loved me baby
And you would do anything I said
Oh but the way you treat me now baby
I just soon rather be dead

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
The way I used to love you
Baby that's the way I hate you now

// Mr. Pawnbroker //

I'm a pawnbroker
What do you want on your ring
I'm a pawnbroker
What do you want on your ring
See like every woman I loaned
They want the same old thing

Have to use my tester
And see if will stand the test
Have to use my tester
And see if will stand the test
Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker
Don't have nothing but the best

18 carat is OK
But 14 carat will make the grade
18 carat is OK
But 14 carat will make the grade
Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker
Don't have nothing but the best that's made

Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker
I pay the best price in town
Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker
I pay the best price in town
Well, if you don't believe me
Baby, just lay your ring down

Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Yes, you may need money, baby
On your ring some day
Well, you can't ever tell
What bad luck may come your way

// Understand //

I've traveled from town to town
Seems like everybody wanna throw me down
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

I went down to the train station
Looked up on the wall
My money was too light, baby
Couldn't go nowhere at all
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

The burden that I carry is so heavy, you see
It seems like there ain't nobody in this world
Who would wanna help poor me

Well, I would be all right, baby
Just give me a break
Good things come to those who wait
'Cause I've been a good man
But I'm a poor man, understand

// Driving Wheel //

Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
Yes, I'll give her everything she needs
'Cause I am her driving wheel

Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back soon
Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin'
Or laid over Saturday afternoon

Yes, every time she walk
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, when my baby walk down the street
She shakes like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, the women all hate her
But man, she's alright with me

Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
Wo, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want nobody else to break the seal
I want the whole world to know
That I am my baby's driving wheel

// Walking Dr. Bill //

Well, my head's in misery
My heart's in a sling
I'm a walking Doctor Bill
People, my whole life is full of pain
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I walked my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cried
I didn't exactly have the blues
I just want satisfied
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I can't sleep sound at night
I just cat-nap through the day
I can't hold out much lounger
People, livin' this-a-way, yeah!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

I'm gonna leave here walkin' buddy
With my clothes in my hand
I got to find my big-legged woman
Before she gets her another man, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

She's a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She's the lovin'-est female
People, I've ever seen, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

// Catfish Blues //

Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me

Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Ragged and I'm dirty too
Well, if I clean up, baby, can I
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you

If I can't, can't come in
Let me sit down front of your door
I'll leave so early, your
Mom won't know
Won't never know
Won't never know

Oh, I know, know my baby
Well, she's going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and I
I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out

Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh, the more that you cry, baby
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
More I'll go away

Well now I know, I know you don't want me
Why in the world won't you tell me so?
Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more

// Hold That Train //

Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Well, I wanna ride your train this morning
Just to ease my achin' heart

Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Well, I hear your whistle moanin' 
And it almost drives me out of my head

I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
Well, I know I should back and buy a ticket
Yes, but I'm afraid to take the chance

Oh, don't stop this train, conductor
Till this old state is out of sight
Yes, don't stop this train, conductor
Till Mississippi is out of sight
Well, you know I'm going to California
Where I, I know my baby will treat me right

// Please Set A Date //

Hey baby, baby please set a date
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Now, when I want some lovin'
I really want it bad
But the way you've been doin' baby
You really makes me mad
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Now, when I want some lovin'
My face gets full of frowns
Now baby, if you don't hurry
I'm going to leave your town
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away

Now, when we first met, baby
We swore we wouldn't part
But the way you're doin' me lately
You're really breakin' my heart
Hey baby, baby please set a date
Well, don't say tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is too far away
