// I'm Gonna Move To The Outskirts Of Town //

I'm gonna move, baby, way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna tell you baby, we're gonna move away from here
I don't want no ice man, I'm gonna get me a frigidaire
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna bring my own groceries, gonna bring them everyday
That'll stop the grocery boy, and keep him away

When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't need nobody always hanging around
It may seem funny honey, as funny as funny can be
But if we have any children, I want them all to look like me
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody always hanging around

// Buzz Me //

When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
Can't believe that you don't love me
Thought our love was here to stay

Now buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
When I say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

Yes, buzz me, baby
I'm like the ship that's lost at sea
Buzz me, buzz me, baby
You mean so much to me
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973

// Caldonia //

Walk with my baby
She got great big feet
She long, lean, lanky
An had nothin' to eat

She's my baby

Yeah an I'm crazy 'bout this woman cause
Caldonia..., your name

Caldonia!

Don't take your big head so hard?

You know I'm crazy 'bout this woman because
Caldonia..., your name

[Spoken:]
You know what?
(What's that?)
My mother told me to leave that girl alone
(I thought that was a good woman, ain't nothin' wrong with you)
I don't doubt it boy, but my mother can't
Understand the girl and she doesn't like her
So I'm gonna go right now to her house, find her
Call her just one more time
I hope she hear me?
(Oh she gonna hear you alright!)
Caldonia, Caldonia!

You know I'm crazy 'bout this woman

[Spoken:]

That you're the one, no kiddin' buddy
I heard what you said
(Your mother jivin', boy)
Now, she said son, she will bale you around if the moment is good
Puttin' down what I did...
So now I've gotta go back out and call her, one more, once
I need one more, ya hear?
Caldonia, 'donia

(I loose her
Loves her just the same)

And I dreams about ya baby
'Cause Caldonia is your name

(No kiddin' that's what you said)

She still would bat me around, but mama wouldn't hear
It wasn't cool, so I'm gonna have to go
Back to the house you know
And call her, one more time
