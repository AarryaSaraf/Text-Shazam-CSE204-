// Our Time Has Come //

Looking back on the road we left behind
I wonder just what it is we've done
Seems like we've earned the right
To throw the dice again
Let's make the pieces fit together as one

To be masters of our own fate
Is all we're asking for
Looks like we don't have long
To wait, no more

Now, now that our time has come
Let's take our chance right now
Now, let's finish what we begun
No time to hang around
Now that our time has finally come around

Looking ahead, just one step at a time
I think that by now we should know enough
Seems like we've learned the way
To keep it all in line
There ain't no way that we will let it get too tough

To be running in our own race
Is all we're asking for
Looks like we don't have long
To wait, no more

Now, now that our time has come
Let's take our chance right now
Finish what we begun
No time to hang around
Now that our time has finally come around
...

// For You, For Love //

Love, has finally come my way
You fill my everyday with love, I think I'll stay around
Your sweet love, has brought new life to me
A pair of eyes to see, so I don't have to dream about
Loving you is changing everything
I've got this song to sing
For you, for love
Oh girl, thank you for the time, we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you every time I think of you and I
Now I live for love
When loneliness is gone, and happiness is found
With love I think I'll stay around
Your sweet love, has taught me something new
Has brought me home to you
So I don't have to dream about
Loving you, is changing everything
I've got this song to sing

For you, for love
Oh girl, thank your smile, for the time we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you every time I think of you and I
Live for, live for, live for love
Loving you is changing everything
I've got this song to sing for you, for love
Oh girl, thank you for the life
I thank you every time I think of you and I
And now live for love
Oh girl, thank your smile, thank you for the time, we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you every time I think of you and I
Now I live for love

// Let's Go Round Again //

Baby, I'm back
And right away I have come to you
To see if the love that we knew before
Has past the test of time, ooh
Time could change almost everything
Sometimes it seems the better side are the
Feelings we once shared
So baby

Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
One more time

Now baby, I know that you think I will be different now
Inside of me nothing has changed
So I'm asking you again, ooh
Please no one else could have brought me back
No one could ever change, the memory I kept within my heart

Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
One more time
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time, one more time, one more time
Let's go round again, one more time

// What'cha Gonna Do For Me //

All night and all day, just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone
The ground that you lose exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
Still, as deep as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

Whatcha gonna do for me
What are you gonna do for me
Whatcha gonna do for me, when
The chips are down

In the cool of the night, when nothing seems right

The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true
If you try to conceal the way
That you feel
You're askin' for trouble
Just as sure as you'll cry
I'm keepin' my eye on you

You don't have to tell me I'm to blame for this
The thing you hold against me is the thing that I miss

// Into The Night //

Into the night...

// Catch Me (Before I Have To Testify) //

I stand accused, I have designs on you
I can't reveal what I've a mind to do
I am no angel, can't you see
No wings have I

So what would you want your man to be
Tell me, tell me
A saint or a sinner, a little of each

Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away

I didn't want to give the game away
Would you?
Ain't that ever true
The mystery's there to keep us hooked
No need to do it by the book

So where would you want my strength to be
Tell me, tell me
A friend or a lover, a just little of each

Catch me away...

Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away
Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away

I did not want to give my game away to you
Don't make me give it all away
Catch me before I'm called upon to testify
Don't make me give it all away
...

// Help Is On The Way //

Seems to me you've been hide far too long
Watchin' the sands of time trickle away
Won't you talk to me
Tell me what's eatin' at 'cha
Even if you don't know what to say

You know that the time is right
To turn this thing around
It's getting closer to you
Don't give up because pain is all you've found

Lighten up 'cause help is on the way
Have a little faith in someone new
This is not a line I'm throwin'
Lighten up 'cause help is on the way

You and me, walking down easy streets together
Is a dream I cannot see slippin' away
Why don't you get to me
Over this distance you've created
And I'll put you in, set you free

You know the time is right
To turn this thing around
You're getting closer to me
Don't give up because pain is all you've found

Lighten up 'cause help is on the way
Have a little faith in someone new
This is not a line I'm throwin'
Lighten up 'cause help is on the way

// If Love Only Lasts For One Night //

Here we are
You and I together for the first time
Though heaven knows, I've wanted you
And I guess you knew but we just never said
Or never had the chance

And if love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

Holding you
Seems like this is what the night was made for
Though who can say what lies ahead
Will this flame that flickers in the darkness
Survive the light of day

And if love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

If love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

And if love only lasts for one night
We got the morning, oh yeah
If love only lasts for tonight
If love only lasts for on night
We will remember, oh yeah
If love only lasts for tonight

// Shine //

Nothing in this world
Seems to function without heart
You oughta know
There's no need to pull yourself apart
Nothing you can do
Seems to matter without love
Don't be afraid
Everything you've got will be enough

All the things you are
Could stay locked up inside
Far from the light of day
It's much more than a matter of pride
Can't you hear them saying

Shine...
Let it be a light that burns within
Open up and
Shine...
Never mind the darkness closing in
You can rise above and
Shine...
Just close your eyes and shine

Whatever you may do
Don't forget about the little things
Small as they may seem
You oughta know
They all add up to someone else's dreams
Whatever you may think
No ones gonna be the the way
You can be the one
It's up to you
There's no better time to call the play

All the things you are
Will stay with you wherever you may go
No use in trying to hide
It's much more than a matter of show
You must be alive

Shine...
Let it be a light that burns within
Open up and
Shine...
Never mind the darkness closing in
You can rise above and
Shine...
Just close your eyes and shine
...
