// Ride //

[Spoken introduction:]
I was in the winter of my life, and the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself, dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour, and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me, and my only real happy times
I was a singer. Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I'd been living, they asked me "Why?", but there's no use in talking to people who have home
They have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality; just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Spoken ending:]
Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people, and finally I did on the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever:
"I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself I ride, I just ride."
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have. I am fucking crazy
But I am free

// 1949 //

Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
What is all this? You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip-gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used
To about all ways he used to [?]
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks

// Afraid //

I'm America's sweetheart
Tryna get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
Why I'm so afraid

And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

So, I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

// All Smiles //

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
'Cause I've seen you walking around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
'Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun

Dah, dah, dah
More fun

// Angels Forever //

Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy-metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you or I am
Bow your heads and take your hands

They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud
You are angels of the night
Rock 'n' roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

Paradise is a hell-colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is a game of do-or-die
I just ride, ride, ride

They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
Forever angels
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

// Architecture //

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now that it's over?

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit, nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space, we lost track of time

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
You know what I'm talking about

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told ya?

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love the way Bill plays guitar

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Honey, how's life feeling now that it's over?
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told ya?
Honey, how's it feeling now that I told you?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you
Honey, how's it feeling?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you

// Back To The Basics //

C'mon

Baby we could go
Back to the basics
Trailer park love
Wearing them ASICS
And gold

I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbours
You've been pretty stupid
Ever since you got famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side
Of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only
We'd go backward

'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see

Baby we could go
Back to the basics, (c'mon)
We were best friends
Crazy and shameless in love

You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I
Ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you
Remember that, boy?

Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out too
Us against the world just
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see

We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on
Sing our song

And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted
I know you'll see

// Backfire //

Salvatore, you can def be my baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high
Back to Malibu in our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight

We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Told you a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose with you, man
And it's not something you choose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began

We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
We've done it a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, "Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how."
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustling every night and day

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how

It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million times before
And I'll run for it a million more

// Bad Boy //

My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
I'm sweet like cherry pie, and he likes this
I buy him drinks and he buys me cigarettes
He thinks that we're a little bit like Romeo and Juliet
Throw me 'round like a hot potato, if he want the butter, then say so
It's wrong, but well, it's okay though
It's okay though

Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy

True love, true love, true love

My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
He thinks it's a little like hair, tits, lips, sips
It doesn't really matter that I do my lipstick all day long, all day long
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
Dear Bonnie and Clyde, it's just like this
He thinks a little like my polka dot dress on
He like my hair long

Baby ghetto love
You know no one loves you better
Baby ghetto love
You can be oh be no better
Ooh, ooh

// Beautiful Player //

Uh, what? Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach-ride time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back (going back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I'm not selfish, I can't help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

// Because Of You //

On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talking about)

It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

// Behind Closed Doors //

I like 'em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

You know I like 'em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like 'em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don't need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I'm his cherry pie

You know I like 'em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

// Ben //

Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right?

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does, in the late night
Hands folded back
Certain of doom
Hold me he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm
Hold me he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
I don't know anything, hm

There you are

// Bentley //

He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "Uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

// Big Bad Wolf //

I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good

I'll take the wrong path
I think I've gone a little off track
And now there's no way back
You took all the apples that I had

But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt

But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you'll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry-red car

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

// Big Eyes //

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

// Blizzard //

Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do's got nothing to do with you

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

// Boarding School //

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie
Let his tattooed ass beat you
I'm a fan of pro-ana nation
I do them drugs to stop the f-food cravings
If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doing crack, drinking P-P-Pepsi

Everyone from home

Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool

But she got a great ass and she knows how to show it
With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doing it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

Everyone from town

If you wanna do that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacationing
You can, you can, you can

You thought that I was just a calendar kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinning

Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

// Bollywood Hawaii //

Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving

// Break My Fall //

The greatest line in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
What you think I'm dumb, dumb, baby doll?
I'm big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Greatest lie in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
Do you really think I'll buy your bullshit boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven't gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I'll crumble if you call

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Break my fall
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run
I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby

// Buddy's Rendezvous //

Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again?
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want?
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened

// Butterflies //

We're sipping cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper "Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you're all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before
They say "I'll save you, save you", but they never do

I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I'll leave you
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
"I wanna take you, take you to the world outside"
Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
"I wanna take you, take you" and I didn't mind

And even then I didn't believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what?)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be forever

I look around, there's no one above you
I think you know that I'll always love you
And baby, I'm bad too, it's not just you
But I can't wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

// Butterflies (Part 2) //

You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him, "Go on, sing a sad song."

My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)

// C U L8R Alligator //

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe."

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

// Catch & Release //

So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparkling like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string

// Caught You Boy //

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, looking kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing-up nights
Drinks on ice

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

// Chelsea Hotel No. 2 //

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music."

Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often

// Children Of The Bad Revolution //

Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every lie

I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cutting edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh
