// Ghetto Vet //

Life....

Niggas used to come and get me

When it was time to disagree with an enemy

Pass the hennessy it gives me energy

Packed the gat in the small of my back

Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack

Talkin' shit cuz I'm down for my set I'm a vet

Smokin' on a wet cigarette

(who these niggas think they are)

(wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)

I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs

Cuz these westside niggas is harder thugs

Enslve us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis

Shootin' at your neighbors

(cuz sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)

Hot rocks fly from the back seat and

Busta ass niggas run like a track meet

An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little (what)

Killer king is the hospital

Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum

And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit

[Chorus]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

(Foe life) I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass

Up early in the morning takin' out the trash

Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser

Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser

One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)

Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:

Are you from the westside is it so?

I said hell yea and who wanta to know (me)

In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud

Puddle full of blood left for dead

The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs

I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center

As I enter I.C.U.

He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital

I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to

Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again

I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide

At night I jerk and jerk

But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)

Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube

I be pissin' through a tube Fool I'm a vet

[Chorus]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Fuck a V-A they need G-A

Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal

Same corner same hood I'm still there

With bandanas tied to my wheel chair

To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired

They mad cuz my tongue get tired

Now everybody wanna put they dope on me

Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD

I'm sitting on a doorway duece five

Dependin on that to keep my ass alive

I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six

My fuckin legs, lookin like tooth picks

Some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill

Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine

Just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose

And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom

Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold

Nigga its the only friend to a stranger AKA hadicap gangbanger

There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet

Fool I'm a Vet

[Chorus 2X]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Life.....

Yea....

Life...

Yea....

Life... Life....

Dedicated to all the ghetto vets

For every nigga that done took one for the hood

When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband

This is for my niggas locked away

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date

But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe

Fuck them license plates because life is great

Niggas jealous of my shit

You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit

While you're rooting and recruiting

Nigga 6-8 whooping

I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping

I come from padres gold in oversized jars

I past up strife and got star awards

No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing

Came out the substation to the hip hop nation

The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga

Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga

Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

Freaky gyration is close to fornication:

Get your ass up and hurra

// Roll All Day //

[Ice Cube]

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat x4]

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 1]

I see you walkin' and I'm damn near stalkin'

You a chicken head and I'm chicken hawkin', now we talkin'

'Bout your unlucky backround

And how your ex-boyfriend is smokin' crack now (why)

I'm very very simpethetic

But baby where you headed?

I got a full tank of unleaded

She got in and had ass for days like

BOOM, BAM, GOD, DAMN!

She aks me would I harm her

No, I'm a charmer

A fuckin' night in shining armour

We went out and had a blast, everytime she walked past

Nigga got a quick fast glimpse of that ass

("what choo wanna do after this?")

I wanna get your tities in my fist

But you wanna kiss

Your mouth might taste like dick (ewww)

And I grew up on bearin' wit, trick

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 2]

Niggas that I know don't kiss no hoes

Niggas that I know don't buy no clothes

Niggas that I know don't fuck no pros

Niggas that I know roll foots (?) in fours (yeah)

Pull them panties off your hips

Pussy deep as crips

And 'bout as wide as my grip

Never ever get me with that wipper feel

They got a pants full of black steel

Am I too real?

You like dick I know you do

Wanna bring out the hoe in you

I know what you're goin' thru

You already think you're cree-al

You should learn to suck this like Vanessa Del Rio

Aww, you thought I was a nice guy

But shit, I was around eight, with bitches gettin' laid

If I wrap my dick in plastic

Now, how wide can that ass get?

It's gettin' drastic

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 3]

Should of picked up an old girl that I know

That's what I get for fucking with you young hoes

About to get an attitude, what's hapenin'?

Baby how you actin'?

Let's get it crackin' (c'mon)

No?

Well then bitch you got to go

I put her ass out, on imperial

Hoe slamed my door, next to texico

Kick my lexo, broke my window

Put out my indo

Jumped out and said "bitch are you crazy?"

Fucked around and got lazy

She jumped in my car, took off, now I'm stuck

And all I want to do was fuck

(damn....)

I had to stroll all day, I had to walk all night

I had a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

// Natural Born Killaz //

[Dr. Dre]

Journey with me

Into the mind of a maniac

Doomed to be a killer

Since I came out the nutsac

I'm in a murderous mindstate

With a heart full of terror

I see the devil in the mirror

Buck buck, lights out

'Cause when I grab my sawed-off

Niggaz get hauled off

Barrel one

Touches your motherfuckin' flesh

Barrel two

Tears your fuckin' heart out your chest

You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click

On my Tech-9 so if you try to wreck mine

Fool it's your bed time

Feel the blast from the chocolate bomber

Infrared aimed at your head

Like your name was Sarah Conner

Decapitatin' I aint hesitatin'

To put you in the funeral home

With a bullet in your dome

I'm hot like lava

You got a problem?

I got a problem solver

And his name is revolver

It's like a deadly game of freeze tag

I touch you with a .44 mag

And you're frozen inside a body bag

Nobody iller

Than this grave yard filler

Cap peeler

Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]

Terror illustrates my era

Now I can't hang around my momma

Cause I scare her

I want to blast motherfuckers up

It feels like I'm bustin' a nut

When I open you up

Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist

All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss

Cause I'm givin dirt naps

Comin' with them bomb ass raps

To make your lungs collapse perhaps

You never sleep

Cause evertime you doze

You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose

Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days

Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze

I never ever ever made a ho stay

But I'm down with Dre

Like AC is down with OJ

So fuck how your livin'

I'm the unforgivin'

Psycho driven

Murdera

It's authentic

Don't panic

I can't stand it

God damn it

Scizophrenic

So fuck Charlie Manson

I'll snatch him out his truck

Hit 'em with a brick

And I'm dancin

[RBX]

Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,

And I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die

I don't wanna

I don't wanna die!

[Ice Cube]

I don't understand the logic in my dreams

But I understand I like the sounds of sireens

Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine

Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine

Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate

Now they stiff and cold

And they pupils won't dilate

Its so much pain

Migraine

Headache

I can hear his bones break

He steps in the single door

Got his ass whipped with 20 lashes

Like that dude up in Singapore

So I'm'a pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer

Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Dr. Dre]

Tic Toc

Toc Tic Toc Tic

Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderin' shit

Keepin' niggaz in order

Makin' their lives shorter

Ready to slaughter

Cause to me a life aint worth a quarter or a dime

Mushroom's got my mind

Hallicinatin

Ain't no debatin'

I'm creatin' an escape

Route to be out without a doubt

Scott Free, so don't even think about tryin' to stop me

Cause I cant wait

I'm out the gate

On the for realla

A thrilla

Or a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]

Gi-Gi Gi-Gi Gaga

They call me da-da

6 million ways to murder

Choose one

Lose one soul

Bodies turn cold

Natural fright from niggaz goin' bump in the night...


Should I peel 'er ([Dre:] yeah)

Should I kill her in my iller ([Dre:] hell yeah)

Then a Natural Born Killa


Should I peel 'er ([Dre:] yeah)

Should I kill her in my iller ([Dre:] hell yeah)

Then a Natural Born Killa


Should I peel 'er ([Dre:] yeah)

Should I kill her in my iller ([Dre:] hell yeah)

Then a Natural Born Killa

// Friday //

[Verse One:]

You know it ain't no stoppin all tha doggs I'm droppin

It's Friday night so everythang is poppin.

I got skin lets spin on da hand,

So let tha games begin.

Yakity yak don't jump back or its on,

Callin up Earl on tha car phone.

Mack 10 just got out of court,

Rollin through tha hood in his super sport ropin Too $hort.

Eighteens got tha rearview mirrors vibratin,

And deep dish daytons.

You know how we do it,

Ain't nuttin to it but tha floss,

Overcrowdin Harrison walks.

'Cuz if ya fuck wit ours,

We leave scars,

Out of G ride cars,

Livin like stars.

Might hit tha highway,

On tha Vegas run fool 'cuz its Friday.

[Chorus:]

Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air,

If ya don't care. [x2]

[Verse Two:]

Standin outside on a Friday livin on tha edge,

'cuz we all got 'dem hard heads.

It's seems like we all are waitin,

For a drive by playin tag wit satan.

But we chillin yeah we ready and willin,

Ya hear about tha latest westside killin.

Forty sippin,

Set trippin,

Fo' dippin,

Get tha grip in,

Neva slippin.

BG's tryin tah hang out,

But OG said take ya little ass in tha house.

My big homey just got out,

Used tah be down now he's just crack ad.

He's bout hard as Darth Vada

In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors.

Just see him in the drive way,

Gettin beat like a smoka fool 'cuz it's Friday.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]

Why must I be like dat and chase da cat,

Or settle for a hoodrat.

Dookie braids no dreadlocks,

Flyin in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock.

And I love her 'cuz she down,

Tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound.

And her ass is big round and wide,

Jacked up makin nigga down tah ride.

Smokin indo,

Playin dat Super Nintendo,

Hear a rat tat tat on my window.

Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust,

Don't trust tha rubber 'cuz its bound tah bust.

In tha oven in tha nappy,

I had on two so I was happy.

'Cuz dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways,

And dat ain't cool fool 'cuz its Friday.

[Chorus]


Throw tha west side in da air,

Throw tha east side in da air,

Throw tha south side in da air,

Throw tha north side in da air.

Oh yeah!

// How To Survive In South Central //

"And now, the wonderous world of.."

"Hey, come to Los Angeles!

You and your family can have peace and tranquility.

Enjoy the refinement.."

"Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?"

"Hello, my name is Elaine --

And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles"


How to survive in South Central (what you do?)

A place where bustin a cap is fundamental

No, you can't find the shit in a handbook

Take a close look, at a rap crook

Rule number one: get yourself a gun

A nine in your ass'll be fine

Keep it in your glove comparment

Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit

Now if you're white you can trust the police

But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts

Watch out for the kill

Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel

And don't get smart

Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson

On stayin alive

In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

"Hi this is Elaine again.

Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,

Or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?

Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready

To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,

So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again."

"This is Los Angeles." "This is Los Angeles."


Rule number two: don't trust nobody

Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body

Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap

And females'll get jacked and kidnapped

You'll wind up dead

Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red

Cause most niggaz get got

In either L.A., Compton or Watts

Pissed-off black human beings

So I think you better skip the sight-seeing

And if you're nuttin but a mark

Make sure that you're in before dark

But if you need some affection mate

Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight

Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe

And you won't survive in South Central

"Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.

You realize that it's fucked up!

It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.

Palm trees and blonde bitches?

I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;

Punk motherfucker!"

And you need your ass straight smoked

Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill

Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is

So show these motherfuckers what's happenin

Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central

God damnit!


Rule number three: don't get caught up

Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up

And they got a vice

On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise

We discern

Cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn

Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease

And start slangin ki's

To an undercover or the wrong brother

And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker

So don't take your life for granted

Cause it's the craziest place on the planet

In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars

They live behind bars

So everybody's doin a little dirt

And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work

So be alert and stay calm

As you enter, the concrete Vietnam

You say, the strong survive

Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,

You tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.

And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,

You know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.

Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.

Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.

You'll sho' get got, just like that.

This ain't no joke motherfuckers.

Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,

Puttin his two cents in..

"This is Los Angeles."

// $100 Bill Y'all //

Get numbers, get names

Thick dames

Headhunters get brains

Big thangs

Sick with it

Bitch, I'm Bruce Lee

Seduce me

You're nice and juicy

In the parking lot, I gots to get mine

Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?

I spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds

Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind

I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime

Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes.

[Chorus]


And I'm in this bitch

With a hundred dollar bill, y'all

About to spend this bitch

I'm in this bitch

I got a hundred dollar bill, y'all

About to spend this bitch

Who got a hundred dollar bill, y'all?

About to spend this bitch

About to spend this bitch.

Got all you freaks lookin'

When we walk by, pussy start cookin'

Rookies start tookin'

Get your ass up, V.I.P. section's gettin' tooken

Might dance, might not

Might spend enough

Cool as hell, but still pipin' hot

Soon as I find a spot

All my people gather 'round

The nigga with the shiny watch--me

Ice Cube, motherfucker

Next to me, you a test tube motherfucker

We kinda rude, motherfucker

Get too close and bucka! Bucka! Bucka!

Don't want no problems, y'all

Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem-solv'

And watch E pills dissolve

Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved.

[Chorus]


Get numbers, get names

Thick dames

Big thangs

Give niggas shitstains

The shit, man

And don't you forget, man.

Security pat downs

But check the people that I'm with

'Cause they'll lay you flat down

And they'll do it right now

Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial

Club-hop, car shows, picnics

Big cars, big jewels, big dicks

Rush doors

Or gotta hop the fence

Blow this door

Gotta blow my rent

Gotta show my ass, then go repent

Gotta call in sick

And tell 'em where I went.

[Chorus]

// You Know (I'm A Ho) //

Hands on our metals never have to fetch hoes

// The World Is Mine //

The world is mine ([whispered] the world is mine)
[repeat 4X]


The world, belongs to me

Niggaz don't know my pedigree, W-S to the C

We be them hogs, that make it rain cats and dogs

We got the "Bud" just like them frogs

Now everybody on the West, show some love

And everybody on the East, respect the Corniche, it's not on lease

Breakin laws, swimmin through the water like Jaws

Gumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls

God damnit, niggaz take my planet for granted I can't stand it

Catch a flight across the Atlantic

Step off the plane, nuttin but expense of the game

Bitch I'm rich you know my name, show me the cane

Now are you sure? One hundred percent pure

Cause if it's not, believe me the shit gettin hot

I got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind

(tell em one more time) the world is mine

[Chorus: Ice Cube]

The world is mine nigga, back up

I gots to get mine before I act up
[repeat 2X]


It's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate

I got a phone call to make, my niggaz tell me it's fake

Oh what a mistake, here's what I want you to break

Tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake

And then set up a date, between me and his mate

Tell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late

Oh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate

Cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate

[Chorus]


Can I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10

Dub-C, K-Dee, and Kausion

It don't stop, niggaz get to bowin a lot

When we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got

Worldwide, nigga take a look outside

Got a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde

Ice Cube is the lick, Westside is the click

(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit)

You wanna check our cajones we got the feds up on us

We gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us

And if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt

My niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout

But we got enough green, from our triple beam

To hire the prosecution, and the dream team

This world ain't nuttin but a dollar sign (ching ching)

I'm a partner in crime, the world is mine

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]

Yeah, you punk ass niggaz know the side, so check it

When you meet us, you better bring your heaters

Cause the only way you could beat us, is if you cheat us nigga

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]

We tight, ha hah

Where you from nigga?

Where you from nigga?

(tell them one mo' time) [Ice Cube:] The world is mine [4X]

Ha ha ha, Westside

// Maniac In The Brainiac //

[Intro: Cube]

In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle

The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets

So here you have it, the Brainiac

Ice Cube

With the Maniac

Mack 10

[Mack & Cube:] Yay-y-yay! [X2]

[Verse One]

[Ice Cube:]

While ya'll niggas think about the pape

I think about which Titanic I'mma sink

The iceberg, with the nice words

I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette

Y'all better get, this dime-mega shit

The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy

Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty

Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs

Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

[Mack 10:]

I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas

'Bout to show these so-called

Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters

Who the man be, and what the number one clique is

Let my nuts hang on these busts

And hoes see how big my dick is

Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted

And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 

Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime

Now we connected

He said, "Mack, when you westsidin' and ridin' is expected"

So I...

[Chorus]
[Cube:] Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
[Mack:] You do the drivin', while I do the jackin'
[Cube:] Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
[Mack:] My nigga if you plot it, best believe I got it
[Mack:] And it's on... feel the chrome

[Verse 2]

[Ice Cube:]

You in the Stargate, trying t'escape, it's not an option

Got torture techniques for them lies, don't ever lie

Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money

Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left

Underground parking, guns start sparkin'

ATF enemies all around start chargin'

Tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend

Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain't speakin'

[Mack 10:]

Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think

(?) gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain't

It's like this on mine, potna

By all means, I got the ball

So it's your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call

Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool

Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool

But know this: I won't hesitate to peel your wig back

I'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak

It's Mack the Maniac, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

[Ice Cube:]

What's the plan? Everything thought out

Everything bought out, like Bill Gates

My niggas love steel weights

I'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years

I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin' beers

I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen

They know when the Brainiac's missin'

The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk

Got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk

[Mack 10:]

You argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em

I'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em

Dog, I knew they were scareless

'Cause my brother Snoop told us

So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us

Now when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on

But I'mma wait in front of they momma house

For that one nigga to get home

And when I gun, watch his body jump

And it's all going to amaze me

To see his own self

Layin' there with his own brains on the pavement

[Chorus]

[Outro: Mack 10]

And it's on... keep takin' 'til it's gone

And it's on... feel the wrath of the chrome

Wessiiide!

Ice Cube the Brainiac

Mack 10 the Maniac

// The Wrong Nigga To Fuck Wit //

[Verse One]

God damn, it's a brand new payback

From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black

How many motherfuckers gotta pay

Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK

Caps gotta get pealed

Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"

It ain't no pop cause that sucks

And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts

Down wit the niggaz that I bail out

I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out

Fuck you Ice Cube, that's what the people say

Fuck AmeriKKKa, still wit hthe triple K

Cause you know when my nine goes buck

It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up

Now let's see who'll drop

Punk motherfuckers tryin to ban hip-hop

Fuck R&B and the runnin man

I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand

Make sure before you buck wit duck quick

Punk, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit


"I'ma let y'all know one thing man.."

[Verse Two]

Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em

Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M.

It's the number one crew in the area

Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya

Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt

Punks roll when I put in work

Cause Lench Mob niggaz are the craziest

And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit

South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell

Hittin fools up with the big ass L

One time can't hold me back

Sweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs

Stop givin juice to the Raiders

Cause Al Davis, never paid us

I hope he wear a vest

It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest

Motherfuckin crew, motherfuckin mob

Do a motherfuckin job in a motherfuckin squad

In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger

And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with


"One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and.."

"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"

[Cube] Drop a old school beat!

[Verse Three]

Like I said, it's a brand new payback

Now in '91, let's see who beats the jack

Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller

(Keep the wack beats out) true motherfuckin baller

And hoes can't roll on

Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"

Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic

I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards

I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue

Goin up against the Zulu

Break his spine like a jellyfish

Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit

Off wit the head, off wit the head I say

And watch the devil start kickin

Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin

Yo, turn him over wit a spatula

Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker

Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick

Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!


"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with.." [repeat 3X]

// Higher //

[Verse 1:]

Yo, I wanna get high

I wanna get high

Walking through campus with my backpack

Bailin' to orientation

So I can change the nation

See many faces but none of 'em mirror me

Show my ID to the punk ass security

Step on the quad lookin' for the track squad

Walked by a bitch who think she's God

Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the Messiah

She wanna take me higher

Keep your rhetoric in the heavens

Look and see a bro' with a fro like Michael Evans

Done spent 6 years in the college

Always telling me to question the knowledge

Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll

And not even one cave bitch in our click

Sayin' fuck Professor Fitz

I come from the land of the Bloods and the Crips (What's up nigga)

Don't like scholarships because they hurt me

Nothin' but a slave to the university

That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya

Caught by a liar who wanna take me higher

[Chorus]

Shit, he wanna take me higher

Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit

I wanna get high so high

Chocolate Thai

[Verse 2:]

I wanna take flight ya Goddamn right

It's a party every fucking night

Been there for about 6 weeks

Walked by the freaks

Look, black greeks

How the fuck ya figure

I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga

White boy in the room with me

Who never saw BET what the fuck

He's about to erupt and turn red

Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads

'Cause he can't deal with the overkill

College ain't nothin' but niggerville

And he regret that his school is filled

With niggers jews and wetbacks

Plus chinks now he drinks

Hour after hour screaming white power

Motherfucker want me to call him sire

He wanna take me higher

[Chorus]

Shit he wanna take me higher

Shit wait until they get a load of me

Shit shit shit

[Verse 3:]

A girl gets date raped just like that

At a frat now she chase the cat

Feminist saying women is God's gift

Do you need a lift can I take a sniff

Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin'

After Deja she from Texas?

Down to kick the asses of the fascists

Who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes

But I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin'

And nobody learnin'

'Cause college is full of shit

Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies

Chillin' at a rally for peace

The beast from white power up in the tower

With the M-1 gun and a scope on dope

Thinkin' he's the great white hope

Motherfucker levels off

He wanna see me 6 feet deep shoveled off

Cause Columbus University is nothing but a empire

Who wanna take me higher

[Chorus:]

Shit they wanna take me higher

Wait until they get a load of me

Shit they wanna take me higher

They wanna take me higher

Unh damn they wanna take me higher

Damn wait until they get a load of me

Damn unh they wanna take me they wanna take me

Them muthafuckas'll never break me shit

// Trespass //

[Ice-T]

How many bullets can your back hold, suckin from the HK

The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray

Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss

I'm kickin up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust

This is my shit, my hood, my turf

My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth

I don't need nobody comin in my territory

Tryin to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin sob stories

[Ice Cube]

Take a good look at my motherfuckin jacker

About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker

Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out

Comin in my hood with his hand out

Tryin to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin mack

Will put a fuckin slug in his back

And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast

On greedy motherfuckers that trespass

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Olly olly outcome free, here come the G

I'm saggin, and Enter the Dragon like Bruce Lee

I gots to get mo' money mo' money

Can't get pussy with no money

See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes

Got zeroes in back of a one

Here's my gun, about to get paid at last

But now I'm gettin covered, in dirt and grass, kick it

[Ice-T]

The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get

The thicker the sweat

Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout

But ya in, but ya gotta get back out

No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob

Crosshair on your dome and your mind's blown

You wanna go home... ain't that a bitch?

Cube, dig the ditch (yep)

[Chorus]

[Ice-T]

I got a full time job of takin suckers out

Breakin em off, yea word, I love revokin clout

Test me, stress me, who could the best be?

The teflon nine go through vests G

But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself

You're chasin extreme wealth

You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin game

Scandalous is your fuckin name

[Ice Cube]

I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit

Ice Cube -- "Wronnnnnnng nigga to FUCK WIT!"

I'm rich, pitchin a bitch about gettin mo'

The big fish, swimmin in big dough

The G backstabber, I got ta have a

Lexus Coupe, when I troop

With the ski mask, gotta get the cash

My homeboy ain't home, so fuck it I'll trespass

// Right Here, Right Now //
