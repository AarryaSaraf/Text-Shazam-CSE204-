Album: EverythangsCorrupt

// Good Cop Bad Cop //

Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Break 'em off some
Yeah

Good cop, good cop, rollin' with that bad cop
What you doing, boy, turn in that blood clot
Buck shot shot, they fly through the drug spot
Robots can't give a damn who the fuck's shot

Clean cop, clean cop, fucking with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop, rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock

You know that mean cop might need a detox
Motherfucker tryna blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop them down, when these bitches tryna lock me down

Hit the ground, hit the turf, walk the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse, that'll make your ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe

West coast war lord
Blacker than the black knight
Fuck a black and white, when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort

Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sister off course
While these motherfuckers chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop

Lazy cop, fuckin' with that crazy cop
Always bragging 'bout that new case he got
Do or die cop, with that suicide cop
Tell the truth cop with that "You-a-lie" cop

Are you fuckin' high cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no motherfuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops,
And my motherfuckin' tickets to the sky box

Hold up nigga (hold up), I'm a rider
Youse a roll up, yep, the controller
Make me mad, that's when I get swole up (don't touch that)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar

Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands up, you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try get aggressive, niggas off the porch

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop (Turn me loose)
White police showin' out for the wack cop

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?

Tell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, motherfuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig a-let the brick go

Black Lives Matter, is not chit chatter
-Cause all they wanna do is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face

The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case

Racist motherfucker

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the wack cop

// Super OG (Intro) //

Everything's corrupt
Everything's fucked up
Everything's 'bout a buck, we shit outta luck, yeah
Blood used to be thicker than water
Now it depends on what kinda water you talkin' about
Niggas'll kill they momma over that almighty dollar
Yeah, you know me, Super O-G
Always down to take a knee

// Arrest The President //

Yeah
When I drop the mic it hit the floor like Thor (That's right)
You can't pick it up no more (Don't even try)
Y'all know what it is, y'all know what it was (Yeah)
Y'all know what it shall be

Get smart 'fore the shit start
'Fore it get dark, 'fore they hit you with a pitchfork
Better crip walk (Crip walk), this is real talk
Smoke Kush and push then we peel off (Eugh)
Niggas still rollin' with the wheels off (Eugh)
Always lookin' out for the crisscross
I'm a bigger boss than Rick Ross
Always winnin', nigga get lost
It's the warlord, bring the voodoo
When I bail through it's crazy like Bellevue
What they tell you? (Leave that boy alone) Leave that boy alone
Like Home Alone (Yeah), fuck the Skull & Bones
Arrest the president, you got the evidence
That nigga is Russian intelligence (Okay)
When it rains it pours
Did you know the new white was orange?
Boy, you're showing your horns
They're tryin' to replace my halo with thorns
You so basic with your vape stick
Let's go apeshit in the matrix

Arrest the president, arrest the president
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)
Arrest the president, arrest the president (Crazy)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence

I took back my eyes, in all black tonight
That's right, some niggas gotta sacrifice
Not a criminal (No), I'm a seminal (Yeah)
I was free once, now I'm clinical (Crazy)
You so technical, this was Mexico
Then everywhere I go is owned by Texaco (Fuck them)
Fuck them and the rest of you (Hell yeah)
I turn a fruit into a vegetable (Pop you motherfuckers out)
I'ma roll with the aliens
Man, fuck these homo sapiens
They don't really wanna make friends (Hell no)
All they want is a Mercedes Benz (Hell yeah)
All they want is their dividends
And decimals, fuck these citizens
They'll treat us like hooligans
Throw 'em in, they don't care what school he in
These people don't play fair
It ain't even fair at the state fair
Give a young nigga grey hair
That's why I'm here, make your ass lay there
Punk, you better stay there
Close your fucking eyes like it's day care
Make myself clear, it ain't Shakespeare
I'm here to take money even fake hair
So desperate is what I'm left with
For the record you're affected
Who you elected is so septic
So full of shit, I can't accept it

Arrest the president (Woo), arrest the president (Woo)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)
Arrest the president (Nigga), arrest the president (Nigga)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)
Arrest the president (Nigga), arrest the president (Nigga)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)
Arrest the president (Nigga), arrest the president (Nigga)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence

I reside on the Westside (Westside)
I murder with my third eye (Third eye)
Niggas so fly, get a bird's eye (Ahh, ahh)
I make 'em scream bloody murder
Let's meet at the White House (Come on)
Run in and turn the lights out
Man, they treat it like a trap house (Yeah)
These motherfuckers never take the trash out (Damn)
They just cash out and mash up
Nigga take your drugs and pass out (Shut the fuck up)
Niggas love to go that fast route (Yeah)
I see you and your black ass, get out
Homie, you play too much (Yeah)
White devils, they doin' way too much (Much)
Most of 'em won't sleep too much
Why they're steady planin'? God knows what (God knows what)
That's why I roll with the real ones
Real ones tryin' to reach millions
Real ones tryin' to make billions
Real ones dressed like civilians

Arrest the president, arrest the president
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Woo)
Arrest the president (Woo), arrest the president (Woo)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence

// Chase Down The Bully //

What the fuck is this shit?

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fullest
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fullest
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready
Blast like confetti, nigga, cut like a machete
You just spent your fetti on a mother fuckin' Chevy
I'm buyin' somethin' heavy, turn the ass into spaghetti
From another planet, no, it's not the Serengeti
More than an African, I am planetary
Bitches think this commentary is military
I kill you and I bury you with the steel that I carry
Now, if he a fascist, I'ma bash his head in
Cock it back, boy, and put the lead in
All you evil forces wit'cha tiki torches
Shove 'em up your ass, freaky intercourses
They try to lie, say I'm hearin' voices
Apocalypse Now, rollin' with the horses
Hit the alt-right with a fog light
See that red sheet? Used to be all white

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)
Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fullest
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fullest
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

Fuck a Trump supporter talkin' 'bout law and order
But all you wanna do is go fuck up reporters
Build a damn wall then fuck up the borders
Hate to see a motherfuckin' nigga with a quarter
Hate to see a nigga wit'cha ugly ass daughter
They feed you bread and water, get you ready for the slaughter
That's why your homeboy just went out and bought a
AR-15, I can make the bitch sing
Ain't no nigga shit, it's some bigger shit
Who can give a shit about white privilege?
Throw your hands up
Pull your pants up
You can't fight in that tight shit, man up
Nigga, stand up
Have you forgotten? Have you pickin' cotton, better get the socket
And if you think Ice Cube give a shit about they statues cover them in pigeon shit

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fullest
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fullest
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

On my way home, talkin' on my iPhone
Mother fuckers tried to kill me with a fuckin' drone
They think I'm Al Capone with a natural comb
You just a clone of the original chromosome
Me? I'm just a student of the Terrordome
You? You just recruitin' for the skull and bones
Me? I do karate on Illuminati
You can view the body
I'm at a pool party

Hah, yeah
I know you internet hoes been suckin' on a lot of shit
But don't worry 'bout me, cuz ain't part of they club

We gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fullest
Chase down the bully hit his ass with the fullest
Then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
String his ass up by his nuts with the pulley

Stay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)

Talkin' 'bout that they strugglin', made somethin' from nothin'

Everything you put in your mouth look like a Altoid
Crazy ass niggas love a bitch named Molly
Passed out on the floor, go and get a dolly

His momma tried to stop him and those youngers had to mob 'em so cops tried to pop 'em but them bullets couldn't drop 'em
Damn

// Fire Water //

A lot of people wonder how they gon' die
How'my gon' die?
Will it be a bullet wound?
Will they die at the hands of the police?
Here's how I think I'ma go

Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Fire water
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

I'm a animal, my splif's flammable
This is Hannibal, I'm a cannibal
It's understandable you think I'm studio
But when we leave the studio, nigga, you's the hoe
Niggas lose your hoe, like usual
Bitch is beautiful, what she with you for?
When Hiawatha drank my fire water said sayonara to his lonely daughter
Fire starter, mister arson
South Central Compton next to Carson
Rips are rippin', dogs are barkin'
Guppies all move over, let the shark in
Blood in the water, cuz in the water
Need to get out, nigga, was it a slaughter?
Fuckin' wit'chy'all niggas, tear in your drawers
This fire water put hair on your balls
This is a rebel without a pause
With three hoes like Santa Clause
Know all the pimp codes and the bylaws
Got enough paper, I could buy y'all
At the Bayou, I could buy you
Walkin' 'round here with a slave IQ
Better get smart or it's deja vu
Back in the dark, nigga, chained to the ark, nigga, fuck

Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

How I do it is lighter fluid
Think you fly? Put a spider to it
Come down heavy, Isaac Newton
While y'all talkin', I be shootin'
Most of these artists be prostitutin'
Gangsta shit, I wrote The Constitution
Bitch ass nigga, what's your contribution?
Hatin' on shit ain't a revolution
Change this shit, fuck the lootin'
West side riders, I'm recruitin'
God is a teacher, I'm the student
Don't bite the apple, I'm rebootin'
Back to the pen and pad
Back to the pen and paper
Niggas wanna catch the vapors but they on respirators
Always on elevators
Always dressed like the Raiders
Always on my way to Vegas

Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

My best wares? Louis chest hairs
Who wanna ball with the California bears?
It's Mardi Gras every time I'm with my players
Alcohol all in the air
I run this shit, I am the mayor
You a crazy bitch, Princess Leia
Don't'cha know my tooth is a dare?
It's the cyclops with the eye drops
Fuck these THOTS and Goldilocks
Bitches wanna go and drink all a nigga porridge
Don't ask me for a piece of pizza
Fold my arms and say, "Bye Felicia"
Why the fuck you messin' with the creature?
Might wake up and fuckin' eat ya
Can hardly see ya 'cause of my shine
I'm legally blind
I'm outta my mind
Study my rhyme, I got the equation for any occasion
Black, white, brown, red, purple, or Asian
My fire water keep [?] blazin'
I got some shit that'll burn your stomach
Make you vomit, the dogs atomic
Please don't try to mix this with chronic
Niggas won't believe that you seen a comet, no

Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Fire water

// Streets Shed Tears //

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
When my story is over and my song is done
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end

All I get is mother fuckin' love in these streets
To most of these tricks I'm a mother fuckin' treat
What's beef? I ain't got no beef
See all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken
And all these chickens? They get plucked
And nobody wants to see the volcano erupt
I'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt
I'm celebrated every time I pull up
You hella hated, every time you look up
I'm elevated to rapper's deluxe
They love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind
This is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine
See, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'
It's all about climbin' a hill of diamonds
I know that you feel it, I know that you felt it
'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it

When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end

Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest
All I got is those fly ass suits and gators
Nobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters
Nobody tryin' to take my life
All these bitches tryna do is replace my wife
But you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice
Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice
Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly
Niggas might not like me but they still love me
Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle
'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle
Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then the bullshit stop
Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible

When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end

I'm the bastard that spit the acid
Fuck a funeral home and a casket
Fuck a funeral song and a procession
Keep God on your dome and count your blessings
Keep the hood in your heart but heaven on your mind
Shake 'em up and roll seven every time
Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up
Every time you see me got a different color cup
This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'
It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'
It's all about givin', about stayin' driven
It ain't about you, it's about these children
So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'
Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?
Will somebody in here hug my fam?
Don't worry about me, you know where I am

When the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone
I know the streets will shed tears for me
(They love me, dawg)
When my story is over and my song is done
(They love me, dawg)
I know the streets will shed tears for me
The end

// Ain't Got No Haters //

[Ice Cube:]
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckin' players
We get money in mother fuckin' layers
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is maids and waiters
All I got is suits and gators
Y'all niggas lost and I'm Las Vegas

Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
Everybody love black ass Darth Vader
You and your women love to see me comin'
Come through bumpin', little kids runnin'
Chasin' me down like the ice cream truck
These police, they never light me up
I'm that nigga, baby, hype me up
Fuckin' up at work, they never write me up
They always hold me down and never raise me up
And all these women wanna glaze me up
Never turnt down, I'm turnt up
You heard me, bitch, I said, "I'm turnt up"
Always on ten, always too loud
Always too hard for this boujee ass crowd
Even these haters, they love my style
So, I don't know what you talkin' about

Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckin' players
We get money in mother fuckin' layers
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is maids and waiters
All I got is suits and gators
Y'all niggas lost and I'm Las Vegas

[Too $hort:]
Your situation is ugly, not mine, nothin' but love for me
You on the grind tryna turn a dub to a G
And I'm flyin' 'round the world doin' shows overseas
I'm chillin' with some females
I don't shop for bargains, fuck a pre-sale
Too much game tryna sell some
You know you can't hate on a real one
Too $hort, I ain't no nice dude
I'm like Ice Cube, run up in your white food
O.G., enjoyin' my life
Still gettin' money when I'm on the mic
Thirty years later still spittin' flows
Gettin' paid to call these bitches hoes
I get love wherever I go
And I'm always tryna get some more
Beeeotch

[Ice Cube:]
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckin' players
We get money in mother fuckin' layers
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is maids and waiters
All I got is suits and gators
Y'all niggas lost and I'm Las Vegas

Jackpot, think I'm in the crack spot? You a crackpot
I'm a slip knot and I'ma get hot
And I'ma stay hot so take a backseat, nigga, Maybach
Boy, do what I say, nigga, robot
You kinda hit and miss, I'm the sure shot
Never sold out, niggas balled out
You also 'bout to fall out when I go all out
Michael ball out but never touch no balls
I ain't a athlete, I can't take no loss
All I know is champagne in my eyes
All this hate is what I don't recognize
All I know is that L-O-V-E
They beg me to drink a forty of O-E
Low key, bump like a oldie
Niggas treat me better than Kobe

Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is mother fuckin' players
We get money in mother fuckin' layers
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
Sorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters
All I got is maids and waiters
All I got is suits and gators
Y'all niggas lost and I'm Las Vegas

A teaspoon of game
And a pinch of bullshit

// Non Believers //

To all the non-believers (non-believers, non-believers)

I make a non-believer say, "Oh my God"
Ain't nothin' too incredible for the Wizard of Oz
Ain't nothin' too regretable for me to lose no sleep
These the cards I was dealt, bitch, read 'em and weep
It's that West side rollin, pussies get swollen
Knockin' niggas down in the pen, I'm bowlin'
Controllin' everything I'm holdin'
I made a promise to myself
I'ma keep it gangsta always even in the hallways of corporate America, break down the barrier
Self-made, Koolaid, fuck what you say
Fuck what he say, pimpin' ain't easy
Don Mega put a dagger in your swagger
Rollin' zones, tell Mick Jagger
Fuck the chit chatter
I got a bladder full of red cup liquor, yes, my nigga
Drinkin' out the pitcher, I turn water into wine like scripture
Make a toast, every dose is a overdose
And that ghost'll make your ass do the holy ghost

Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

Boo, I pop up like a phantom
And niggas got to take the ass whoopin' that I hand 'em
Yup, the guys call me Samson, I'm dangerous with a Samsung
Call my niggas at random and they quick to make ugly outta handsome
Old rappers, I fuck up your grandson
New rappers, meet Charlie Manson
I brainwash your damn son, yup, he'll leave the house with a handgun
But if he ran into Zimmerman, pull it out homie, you ain't got to run
It's a cold, cold world for all these non-believers and underachievers
These fake ass bitches and divas
Where the fuck will they go when they leave us?

Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

Don't get hogtied fuckin' with the raw hide
My four-five make the law hide
For life, gangsta for life
Think about your wife 'fore you play with your life
It's that rattlesnake from the battle state, trick
That python with the mic on, bitch
Palm trees are like napalm, grimy
In my hood he like Treyvon, try me
I'm walkin' home with my Skittles
The neighborhood watch first house to get riddled
Bust, leave bullets in your pillow
You fuckin' hero, don't make that bitch a widow
This gon' hurt just a little
White people, stop sayin' 'ghetto'
It's like the pot callin' the kettle
Damn, you the reason why we ghetto

We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

Can you believe this mother fuckin' shit?
Havin' faith is believin' in somethin' you have yet to see
You got to believe in somethin', homie
Why not believe in me?

// Everythang's Corrupt //

[Intro: x2]
Everythang's corrupt
Everythang's fucked up
Everythang's 'bout to buck me shit out of luck

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Go to school
The teacher want to fuck the students
Go to church
My preacher turn to prostitution
The prosecution never read my files
That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial
This shit is wild
Chickens getting sick as the cows
Birds falling out the sky, fish dying in piles
It's fishy
Politicians smell like my balls
Talking that shit will he cripple my styles
I got many
Now I'm pinching pennies, no doubt
I squeeze Lincoln so hard
A fucking booger came out
It's a shame
I used to be on top on my game
They took the shirt off my back, and replaced it with chains
I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the "Tea Party"
He used to hate Obama 'till he felt Hurricane Charlie
Looking for his FEMA Check
It's gone with the wind
When them dicks is in
You know the fix is in

[Hook: x2]
For my birthday, buy me a politician
It's a shame that you got to dish your children
Everythang's corrupt
Everythang's fucked up
Everythang's bout' to buck me shit out of luck

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Everythang's a scam
Beat the next man, that's capitalism
They'll just, built a new prison
For your slick ass niggas
That's trying to beat the system
Put you on the front line
If you ain't re-enlist in this
It's hot, in hells kitchen
Get ready, for the lynching brainwash media
And puppet politician
Keep out of position
Out of commission
Buy, medicine or food
That's not a decision
The 99 percent
Is mad and trying to vent
Police grab my fucking arm, then they got bent
Now it's in a splint
I can't pay my rent
The interest on my credit card
I ain't made a dent
The U.S. Mint
I heard they about to print
But it's fucked up, cause I won't see a cent
I'm sick of getting ignored
This wall I can't afford
I'm going to the pent
Free room, free ward, bitch

[Hook x2]

[Outro:]
It's a wall of confusion
My niggas stay losin'
I know what ya' doin'
They drug abusin'
My bitches be choosin'
My music be uzin'
Them thugs be cruisin'
They love what you doin'
A wall of confusion
My niggas they losin'
I know what ya' doin'
The drug abusin'
My bitches be choosin'
My music be uzin'
Them thugs be cruisin'
