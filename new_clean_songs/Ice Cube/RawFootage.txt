// What Is A Pyroclastic Flow? //

[Keith David]

What's the definition of a pyroclastic flow?

That's what happens when a volcano blow

That's what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow

Red hot lava mixed with salava

Pulvarising everything in it's wake

Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow

And noone will survive this one

// I Got My Locs On //

[Chorus]

I got my locs on [2x]

And you can't see my eyes [2x]

I got my locs on [2x]

And you can't tell I'm high [2x]

I got my locs on [2x]

And you can't see my eyes [2x]

I got my locs on [2x]

And you can't tell I'm high [2x]

[Ice Cube - Verse 1]

I got my locs on, welcome to the terrordome

I got them carrots on givin off them pheromones

women love it when they see me on that motorcycle

niggas hate it cuz they know I'm makin more than Michael

been ballin since the word ballin played out

they brought it back to describe me in that maybach

me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin with our locs on

smokin somethin good fuckin up the ozone 

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy - Verse 2]

brand new Versaces ran me a buck 50

(they must have set you back) naw baby not really

switchin lanes yes yea the chopper's just silly

when it's bustin at your ass we just laughin at ya really

I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin niggas on

keep the cashmere vickis on yea she keep them vickis on

keep my locs on see you hatin motherfuckers

keep my locs on you know they match my bag suckas

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

I got my locs on cuz my eyes are burgundy

and when I get home I don't want the third degree

the verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me

they scared of the consequences comin from my defenses

it ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin fences

lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches

next time understand what you fuckin' with, it's legendary status

sittin behind these glasses nigga 

[Chorus]

// It Takes A Nation //

[Ice Cube]

There are seven known wonders of the world

Yeah, hehe, you about to witness the 8th muh'fucker


I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors

My nuts play ping-pong from the noise

You can hear me from a block away

I'm sittin next to yo' ass and can't hear, what you got to say

My shit is loud, my ears is ringin

My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin

I feel like a vet ballin on these rookies

An old school bully, you must have played hooky

I bring it like a bookie my aggression is depressin

Don't give a motherfucker time to learn his lesson!

A LUNATIC~! Y'all know what I represent

The only rapper who wanna fistfight the President!

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

It take a nation of niggaz to hold us back

[Ice Cube]

When I bang this is dangerous, niggaz go brainless

So bang this with the fo'-five stainless

And understand that you lookin at the famous

West coast rapper, who act like a anus

Hollywood! They thought they could tame this

pitbull, but I know what the game is

Them fuckers cheat like a NBA ref

If you smoke one they'll electrocute you to death

I got God on my intellect, Godzilla on my neck

When a nigga come through, who you wanna holla at

Ghostriders hit the deck, when your boy got a tec

Where the fuck is, Afrika, Bambaataa at?

We need to take it back, fuck Viacom

Clear Clear Channel, and Radio One

You motherfuckers programmed by the programmers

That's why you gettin locked up by the do' slammers

Not me!

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

They music so fluffy, I'ma stay gutter

That shit is kind of popcorn, my shit is so butter

My style never change, in 22 summers

Straight independent, and doin my numbers

This ship don't sail, you know I'm still paid

So sourpuss niggaz, can drink lemonade

I'm doin it for the love, you doin it because

you need that advancement to spend on them dubs

I don't need a penny, but I need many

Don't worry about my money boy cause I got plenty

You muh'fuckers worry about flossin so much

You don't know the fundamentals you forgot how to brush!

These 32 teeth, will give yo' ass grief

Bite you like a Fatburger if you got beef

So who's it gon' be? Your favorite MC

You scared of the government they scared of me

Now what?

[Chorus]

It take a nation of niggaz and streets of crack [echoes]

// Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It //

[Female:]
Maestro!

[Ice Cube:]
Blame me

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

You looking at the grand wizard,
War lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches

And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna

Ain't nothing like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona

I'm Utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it
As soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain
And you a lieutenant

I can say what I wanna say
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you

Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, gangsta
And why should I change that
Fuck you all motherfuckers trying to change rap
Say what, say what
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back
Say what, say what

I'm trying to get me a Maybach
How you motherfuckers gonna tell me don't say that?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talking 'bout real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back
Use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack, for real
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal 
Fuck them, fuck them

And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot vaness and imperial
Look at my life
Ice Cube is a miracle

It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't got to be fake cause he is my homie

If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

Oh, yeah, and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talking about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times out of 10 you don't know the fuck you're talking about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine

// Hood Mentality //

[Ice Cube]

Fuck school nigga, I'ma be a dope dealer

I'ma be a killa, yep a urban guerrilla

I'ma stack scrilla, yeah buy me a villa

Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla

I don't give a fuck that she look like "Thriller"

Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her

Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler

Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla

Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail

Love the way these niggaz smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell?

Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle

Love to see my woman juggle nuts 'cause she got to hustle

I don't give a fuck how my life go

Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without Geico

Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho

But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle

Gunnin' niggaz down 'cause they don't got the right clothes

Hit the wrong person 'cause we shoot just like hoes

First I was blood thirsty, Mr.-Mr. Controversy

Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to Berkeley

[Chorus - X2]

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

[Ice Cube]

Fuck school nigga, if I grow a little taller

Everybody tell me I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' be a baller

So fuck that thinkin', fuck that thank and fuck them Lincoln's, I want Franklin's

Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe

I'm gon' be that little fool comin' in your living room

Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school

Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL

I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail

I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick

(I wanna be like Pacman Jones), (I wanna be like Michael Vick)

I wanna be like Barry Bonds, (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson)

Leave this field, leave this prison, tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em

I wanna be all broke up, movin' all old and slow

I wanna be a alcoholic just like Broadway Joe

I wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike

Used to have a few Bentleys, now I just ride a bike

[Chorus - X2]

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

[Ice Cube]

Fuck school nigga, they ain't tryin' to educate me

All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately

I'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth

I wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fuckin' elf

No kid left behind but he get the run-around

Can't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to dumb us down?

Don't trust the government, President is for sale

He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well

Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell

Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?

Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail

I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale

You can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe

But you only gon' get paid off what you know

If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me

Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary

[Chorus - X2]

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

// Why Me? //

[Ice Cube ad libs and shouts for first 20 seconds]

[Ice Cube]

Why the fuck you wanna murrr-dah me?

Your punk ass never heard of me

I never did nuttin to your family

Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly

You wanna take the life God handed to me

Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan of me

Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me

That's a animal, a fuckin cannibal

I'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international

gangster pull, I'm a bull in Barcelona

with a Corona, youse a fake-ass nigga

Where's your owner? I'm a real live man

You a persona, now I'm a goner

Call my momma, and the coroner

Mr. Gun Man, your plan is workin

Cause niggaz is dyin, and mommas is hurtin

[Chorus - sung]

Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me

You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree

Now - sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you & me

You never know who you facin, who you chasin, the life you wastin

[Ice Cube]

I was made by the one and only G-O-D

To take my life, to the T-O-P

Now here comes a motherfuckin D-O-G

who ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P.

Tryin to be somethin he saw on BET

Either T.I.P., or B.I.G.

I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV

but a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G.

I'm an O.G., never had to fake it

God gave me this, how you gon' take it?

What'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven

and he asks you why did you send back his present?

Who the fuck are you~? You motherfuckin peasant!

Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing

Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes

Nigga hell on earth is bein stuck in the 80's

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Before you shoot me man think about it

Let's go have a drink about it

Before you make a stink about it

Man let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it

But just don't be a coward

And take my life, cause you got the power

of the white man's gunpowder

Cause you might face a gun tower

And time never run out

They take the fun out, 'til your life run out

So don't pull the gun out

If you ever want a house just like Run's house

It's better than the big house

Let's go find some women we can dig out

Find a place we can pig out

Party all night 'til the owner say get out

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Dedicated to all the niggaz

That's dead and don't know why

Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em

And ask these questions

Why me homey, why me?

// Cold Places //

[Chorus]

To all my people goin through it on a daily basis

And it seem like the world is full of cold places

Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause

you can do it and the man will get you through it

I believe that, homey I believe that

If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back

[Ice Cube]

They say "Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it

How you get through it and them other niggaz blew it"

I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it

Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it

So self-educate, nigga don't hate

Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight

Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube

Fuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school

The game don't change just the players

The rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers

(Hahahaha!) They make it up as they go along

But I'm goin on 25 years strong

The shit I say might get you through the day

Or change your whole life, in a major way

The shit they say, might catch you a case

The shit I say, feel like your birthday

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this

Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss

She said "Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall

All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers"

It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket

If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it

Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat

Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets

They keep callin me

They keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin

In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out

In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out

Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled

Get you in the system, get you in the soil

And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal

Saw you UVN, nigga digital

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

I know, it's fucked up how they do us

Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis

Take that money that was allocated to us

Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us

Watchin Katrina, is worser than Ike & Tina

See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA

Louisiana got racist-ass politics

Free the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX~!)

Your honor, Osama, Obama

Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin with my comments

They want us to quit, forget

And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics

A lunatic is in the White House

Make me wanna go do a lick right now

But they'll make a nigga bow down

in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

I believe that, homey I believe that

If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back

// Jack N The Box //

The Westcoast Warlord,

The Grand Wizard,

Ice Cube,

Motherfuckers head so big they call him 'jack in the box',

[Verse 1]

I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,

Make Rob Deniro look like a zero,

Shine the spotlight, this is my night,

Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,

I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,

In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one

Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,

When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,

When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,

Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,

A allstar, superstar entertainer,

World class, first ?ballot? hall-of-famer,

Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,

How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,

Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,

I'm loved by your grandmama, and your baby

[Chorus]

See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,

I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stacking a lot,

[Hook]

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

[Verse 2]

I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,

Now I am a winner, in a convention center,

I got to take a bow, 'cause I still wonder how,

The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,

Just think if I had got locked up,

No 'Boyz in da Hood' thanks to America,

No 'Eazy', 'NWA', no 'Friday',

Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,

Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,

To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,

Throw your hands up, you got to man up,

I had to show the world, what I was made of,

What you say Blood, I was a slave 'cause,

Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,

I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,

See the whole industry had to bite my style,

[Chorus]

See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

I knew we would win so I'm bagging a lot,

I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

My shit is so dope it's like cracking a pot,

[Hook]

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

[Hook 2]

Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,

And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,

I got to let them know I never break like glass,

What you looking at it's top notch world class,


Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,

And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,

I got to let them know I never break like glass,

What you looking at it's top notch world class,

[Chorus]

See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,

I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',

Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stacking a lot,

[Hook]

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

Shine that light on me, put that light on me,

'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D.

// Do Ya Thang //

[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

[Verse 1]

I'm in that Hot Thang, gutter lane

Dippin' with that wood grain

So fuckin' hood, mayne

They call me The Boogeyman

In that slow lane, what is your whole name?

I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane

Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate 

Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait

Roll at my own pace - nigga, don't hate!

Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!

Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)

Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!

That's how it's goin' down out here in California

Listen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!

[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who is the flyest one of all?

[Verse 2]

Now pull in the parking lot

Nigga, find a parking spot

Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot

Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.

Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!

Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'

When we roll by, pussy still cookin'

Freaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars 

If you don't like my face - bitch, look at my car!

Keep it simple, I told you once befo'

It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'

It really don't matter how I get you in my low

Just hop in, let's go

And let your friends know!

[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who is the flyest one of all?

[Verse 3]

Do ya thang, girl!

Fuck what they lookin' at!

We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat

West Coast, baby - with so much gravy

You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's

I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad

When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that

But never chase it, my game is so basic

As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?

Just face it, put me to the test

Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success

Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star

In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)

You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's

And we get lap-dance from nuns 

They put away they crucifix

And they say, "Ice Cube - boy, you the shit!"

[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who is the flyest one of all?

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who is the flyest one of all?

[Bridge]

I see you lookin' at me

We don't give a fuck!

What you lookin' at?

We gonna give it up!

[Chorus]

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Mirror, mirror, on the wall

Who is the flyest one of all?

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at! 

Do ya thang, mayne

Fuck what they lookin' at!

// Thank God //

[Intro]
I do gangsta rap
They wanna blame world problems on gangsta rap
It's our fault, cause motherfuckers is dying in Iraq
It's our fault, cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's gangsta rap fault, that people are poor can't get
enough to fucking eat or live their life
That's rap music fault
It's rap music fault, that we got all this goddamn laws
and restriction and shit we can't do
They blame it all on us
I'm blamin' them for gangsta rap,
because if they didn't create this kind of condition
I wouldn't have shit to rap about
You know what I mean?

A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through
The man is in the building
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture

[1st verse]
I walks in, with that California swagger
With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gonn take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
Cuz one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off
Ice Cube baby, make you take him serious
Everthin' I say, ends with a period
Everthin' I do, ends with you curious
Lookin' for the best rapper
God damn period

[Chorus]
(Thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap
(So thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap

Comin' live from Los Angeles
I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)
I know you saved a little something
(I know, I know)
I know your mouth is still runnin'
(I know, I know)
All smiles when I'm coming

[Verse 2]
When I step up in the spot
Is he a thug or not
Is he a jugganaught, no I'm a astronaught
Nose all in the clouds, Ya'll think I'm too proud
Got to stay above the crowd, How you fuckers like me now
Some of ya'll start to smile
Some of ya'll start to frown
Some of ya'll back up
All niggers start to clap
Now I gotta act up, kinda like Bobby Brown
Better call for back up, when I shut this lobby down
When will you realise the cycle will continue though
Commercials for gatorade
Boy is it in you
hate to see me comin'
Riches full of drummin' ??
Me and my ladies
Superman and Wonder Woman
He think he the shit, the shit think he me
So come smell mine, I bet it don't stink
I am the link, the food and the drink
The colour in the Kool aid, the nigger in the meat
(Don't trip)

[Chorus]
(Thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap
(So thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap

I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)
I know you saved a little something
(I know, I know)
I know your mouth is still runnin'
(I know, I know)
All smiles when I'm comin'

Thank God that The Gangsta's back [Scratched]

[3rd verse]
When will they realise, they'll never stop me
They call me arrogant
They call me cocky
Just because, I wont let them chop me
They want to whoop my ass, but this ain't Rocky
I'm as hot as an habotchi
Star child comin'
And I promise ya'll I'ma keep it one hun'ed
Ya'll promise me you wont T.R.I.P
Or I'ma have to hit your ass with a 2 piece
Hit you with some rice and two more sides
Don't you know my niggers turn haters in the mash poetatus
I'm the macaroni with the cheese nigger please
when you see me on the red carpet, down on your knees

[Chorus]
(Thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap
(So thank God)
Thank God The Gangsta's back [x3]
And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap

I know you hate to see me comin'
(I know, I know)
I know you saved a little something
(I know, I know)
I know your mouth is still runnin'
(I know, I know)
All smiles when I'm comin'

// Here He Come //

[Ice Cube]
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite

[Chorus]

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go

[Ice Cube]
Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit

[Chorus]

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go

[Doughboy]
See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit
Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

[Chorus]

// Get Money, Spend Money, No Money //

Yeah
Gangsta
Uh

[Verse 1 - Ice Cube]
Tell me all my children
'Fore I come through, is the hood in the building? (yes)
You won't believe what I'm dealin
This West coast shit, oh what a feelin (ah)
Niggaz think I'm drug dealin
'Cause I roll by with no motherfuckin ceiling (none)
Is he worth a hundred million?
No need to ask Ice Cube how I'm livin (how ya livin loc?)
I still got the recipe
South Central LA is the pedigree
Don't try to tell me what it better be
I have your ass up in physical therapy
A outlaw like a Cherokee
The rap industry tried to bury me
But if I died on the mic up at Larry B
I'm so heavy you bitches couldn't carry me

[Chorus - Ice Cube - 2X]
Get money, spend money, no money, lookin like a dummy
(I really don't give a fuck)
Your money ain't my fuckin money, got a pocket full of money
(Come on homie throw it up)

[Verse 2 - Ice Cube]
I don't accept no disrespect
Only thing I expect is self check
Just grin and bare it
Got an ass whoopin that your ass don't wanna inherit
Most rappers are parrots
They say what they told to say, to get a neck full of carrots/karats
Got your mama embarrassed
How long 'fore they callin us terrorists? Nigga, I'm serious
I, keep it gangsta but I keeps a job
'Cause it's, hard to sleep when you steal and rob
And ya, got to run here comes the blob
'Cause, Uncle Sam is like part of the Mob
Break your self he'll take your wealth
Don't get it twisted, you a motherfuckin elf
And Santa Claus will go for self
All you got is your balls and your health

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 3 - Ice Cube]
Niggaz brag about what they got
But we don't own a skyscraper, now that's paper (now that's paper)
One generation from slums
Happy for these little crumbs, you little bums
We saw you pull up but nigga shut up (shut up)
You always talkin about a fuckin car or truck
You always talkin about some fuckin rims or interior
That kind of shit'll keep our ass inferior
I'm tryin to eat tomorrow
Ain't tryin to hear about the little bitty shit you bought
Saw your little bitty house on "Cribs"
Where you fuck your wife and feed your kids (uh uh)
Nigga be quiet, ain't shit private
Everything for sale, you can buy it
All this self snitchin, all this self tellin
Motherfuckers goin back to the watermelon

[Chorus - 4X]

// Get Used To It //

[Ice Cube]

If you try to get with me, pull a four and a fifty

Fuck your monkey ass up, like Bobby did Whitney

Trigger fingers get itchy, when niggaz get bitchy

And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki

Pull your green in your iffy, I'm clean and I'm spiffy

If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy

All my niggaz that's with me, all my bitches are picky

To ride around us right on time, bitch you know it's tricky

Take a hit of the sticky, everybody get tipsy

When we hittin' that whiskey, all my niggaz get pissy

Don't fuck with no sissy, all we bumpin' is missy

If you know where I am, motherfucker come get me

I'm a man not a Mickey, all my niggaz love hickies

that don't go away 'til you're well in your sixties

All I'm wearin' is Dickies, don't try to evict me

When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nikki's

[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

[W.C.]

Barracuda with it, call security

Fuck the dress code, I'm in a white T with jewelry

Hand to my side with my nine, sat lyin' back

In the club with your baby mama in my lap

Lookin' fly like I got a pocket full of stones

Pro fitted on, wearin' chronic cologne

Big watch, big rocks, grip glocks, dick guap

What you niggaz thought, motherfucker this is Lench Mob

Dub make the trigger knock, talk shit

I'll put additional air condition holes in your Bentley top

And shorty got 'em gettin' low, I rich rolls

Swervin' on them MVP's, I call 'em Kobe's cause they 24's

Still spittin' out sunflowers, Dub and Don Dadda

Bustin' more gun powder than gun towers

Down South, y'all can Screw it, it's the West, too truest

Keep the party jumpin' like do it fluid and never lose it

[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

[The Game]

Who my gangsta rap teacher? (Ice Cube) Nigga you better know it

It's the Don Dadda Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet

Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes

My flow is razor sharp, I'm comin' straight for your throat

With that West Coast, gangbang, watch him when his chain hang

East Coast, Down South, niggaz do the same thang

Throw up your dubs like Wu-Tang, who bang

harder than that nigga bailin' through your hood with two chains

Swangin' like his nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck

Bout no nigga that ain't bangin' in no khakis or some Chuck's

It's that Westside, Connect'd with that nigga who flow so wreckless

He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I'll bet this

motherfuckin' Coast ain't got shit after me

Ain't have shit before Cube except a W.C.

The Maad Circle is back, with mad purple in fact

I'm bout to join the Lench Mob, that's me squirtin' the mac, motherfuckers

[Chorus - X2]

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

And y'all better get use to it

// Tomorrow //

[Ice Cube]

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard

The West coast warlord, and the future is today


Cause tomorrow - that shit never come

I worry 'bout today and this urban decay

I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop

Get whack, and turn into gridlock

I don't know is it a government plot?

I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not

That's all we got and if you throw it away

You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay

In your Izod, this the rap God

What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?

Downloader, what'chu gon' do

when your favorite MC, got to sue you

Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo

Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu

Cause you wanna steal this good music

Put me out of business, now you lose it

[Chorus: sung with ad libs]

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow (that shit never come)

This is very hard to swallow

Keep your hand up on that throttle

Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business

But today, I'ma drink this liquor

Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker

But today, I'm just the same old nigga

You know that shit is still a day away

Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway

Cause everybody is Nostradamus

Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?

To all the lil' mamas

Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas

If you a bitch, please be honest

Actin like a hoe you're not an an-gel

While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future

Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you

Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral

Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Tomorrow~! That shit never come

I know it sounds strange but today is never done

I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1

While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons

Up on my feet at the break of the sun

President of the Gangster Na-tion

We don't go to war, we go to the store

We rob from the rich, and give to the poor

Hip-Hop, oh what a bore

Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door

(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets

Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat

The nerve of them, I never heard of dem

Askin me about, my urban spins

And if I got about, a thousand of them

I'm a crate MC, accordin to them

Fuck that!

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Ice Cube - over last repeat to fade]

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard

The West coast warlord, the future is today

Get your grind on mayne, get your grind on mayne, get your grind on

// Stand Tall //

[Ice Cube]

Now is the time...

C'mon y'all


Stand tall, live your life to the limit

Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic

And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick

I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it

Now - every day I think about my color

And all the crazy shit we do to one another

I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother

Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother

If not, we gon' pull these triggers

Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz

I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus

bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness

You can too, you got the power to

Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you

I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you

But check it out I understand what you goin through

[Chorus: sung from samples]

But remember, brothers and sisters

You can still, stand, tall

Just be thankful...

For what you got

[Ice Cube]

I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh

Here comes another rapper with a song about hope

All you wanna hear is a song about dope

And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope

But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap

No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note

Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes

And some of our people used to hang from trees

Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ

So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right

Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke

I'm the sunlight, too bright to look

When it's all said and done I should write the book

You too cool for school, too old to know?

Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow

I understand, it ain't no love lost

But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Yeah, f'real

I was born in the mud but I came out clean

That's 'til the government tried to intervene

Tried to lock me up when I was only 19

Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream

I make shit raw that piss off the law

If you want some fake shit turn this off

If you want some realness I know you can feel this

Maybe we can heal this just like an illness

Black on black, I got'cho back

People don't think that we know how to act

Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack

And the CIA, won't take it back

Never on top, always on the bottom

Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham

Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten

Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Stand up, f'real...

Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit

Heh, in the belly of the evil empire [fades]

// Take Me Away //

[Ice Cube]
Hahaha, today was a good day
Know what?, sometimes I just get on my knees
You know what I mean?
And pray to the man with the master plan
To swoop on down (swoop on down)
On that mothership, scoop a nigga up... 

Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty
Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Muhammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can run it, I'ma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plummet
America eats its youth like reptiles
Don't worry bout tomorrow, let's get this right now
They want to run us in the ground
Educate yourself before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a styrofoam cup?
Environmental scene, I'll keep it clean
But if I go green, you know what I mean, bitch

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube for President
Let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I'd run the government - make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to be celibate
Secret Service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a Superdelegate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo' mama
The Terminator, are you Sarakana?
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna?
In California, they strap you to a gurney
And murder yo' ass, in front of your attorney
Do you really wanna take this journey?
Ain't scared of none of y'all motherfuckers like Bernie
Mac (step back) Step back, I got the Mac-11
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my reverand

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

[Ice Cube]
Now the Lord is my shepherd, my flow is respected
Worldwide, from the West I got to rep it
So please check it, 'cause my style is infected
with the virus, Ice Cube's the Osiris
I bail through, they wanna put me up in Bellevue
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
Speak on it and they'll get mad at you
You think I do this bullshit for your gratitude?
I'm a Nigga With a Attitude
I'ma do what I gotta do just to change my latitude
Pimp the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistenin'
And niggaz listenin', from your local prison
I'm a prism, your only vision is a rainbow
in the sky when I spit the ism, come on

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people

// Don't Make Me Hurt Ya Feelings //

[Ice Cube]

From hood to hood, sea to shinin sea

Let this be the anthem, when you niggaz see me

Fuck 'em, uh-huh

[Chorus]

When I'm on the block, and you see me chillin

With that drop-top, don't let me hurt ya feelings

When I'm in the club, lookin like a million

With that bitch you love, don't let me hurt ya feelings

[Ice Cube]

Tick tock, niggaz see me on the block

and they stomachs drop, cause I'm so fuckin hot

Now, you know my M.O. pull up and blow the horn

She runs out at night and comes back in the morn'

Leave these niggaz lookin like Children of the Corn

Ain't nuttin in the world like a bitch nigga scorned

Forewarned if you thinkin 'bout this porn

It may result in yo' drawers gettin torn nigga

I'm Jose Jackson last born

I'm a rooster, Foghorn Leghorn

Youse a loser, get your feelings hurt when I seduce her

She turn my dick to stone just like Medusa

Mad cause I got my dick sucked, and my balls licked

Faggot niggaz come out the closet

You know that bitch you like that's throwin the P

You know that bitch you like is goin with me

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Let the fo' chrome blow ya dome, nigga I'm the king of Rome

Jim Jones these hoes into my living room

Niggaz get jealous, at the Goodfellas

"He's a hot dog~!" Nigga add relish

Papered out, lay you out, fuckin with my paper route

Take you out so momma cain't make you out

When I creep niggaz read 'em and weep

When they peep I'm a fuckin wolf dressed like a sheep

So fresh, so clean, so nice, so mean

She's a motherfuckin fiend for this niggarole supreme (yeay-yay)

Hoes scream they wanna be on my team, but uhh

It's a dream like Martin the King

Heartbreaker, money taker, nigga, it's my nature

to shake her, soon as a nigga break her

And I'm done, you can have her back

Sucker niggaz askin where yo' ass was at

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

My hood, yo' hood, niggaz up to no good

Get your shine on, please make it understood

Get your grind on nigga 'til it's all good

Run up on these 24's - wish you would


I wish y'all bitch niggaz would

Swizz Beatz wanna give you crybaby niggaz a pacifier

When you see us comin get to runnin [fades out]

// Crack Baby? //

[Chorus]

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]

Let me tell y'all, the definition of shady

It's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy

Do some dumb shit, dumber than join the Navy

What yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?

Strap it on please, you're spreadin' STD's

throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease

You took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones

Bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones

You's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there

Like you love it, but nigga I'm outta here

When they crack the door, boy I ain't comin' back

I'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?

[Chorus]

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]

Sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the Ayatollah

Went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers

He looked at me like "Cube, I thought you was a soldier"

I am nigga, but not for a Coca-Cola

Jumped out my car when his head hit the tar

It bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar

They jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser

Fifty thousand volts turned him into Joe Frazier

Beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash

Came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car

Blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar

I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are

[Chorus]

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]

You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up

Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a donut

My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm

He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm

Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle

Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?

You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle

With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel

I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it

Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid

You say "Yeah man, you better get used to it"

They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it

[Chorus]

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?
