Album: Parade

// Christopher Tracy's Parade //

Everyone come behold Christopher Tracy's Parade
The show will proceed, unless it should rain strawberry lemonade
Hopefully, that will not occur; the man above has been paid
Give what you can, all you can stand, and all of your life will be made

Everyone should come and dig Christopher Tracy's piano
The chord strikes, the devil no like, so he runs 2 his evil car

Everyone come behold Christopher Tracy's Parade
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us

// Under The Cherry Moon //

How can I stand 2 stay where I am?
Poor butterfly who don't understand
Why can't I fly away in a special sky?
If I don't find my destiny soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

I want to live life to the ultimate high
Maybe I'll die young like heroes die
Maybe I'll kiss u some wild special way
If nobody kills me or thrills me soon,
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

If that's alright

Lovers like us dear are born 2 die
If they don't find us what will we do?
I guess we'll make love under the cherry moon
I'll die in your arms under the cherry moon

// Life Can Be So Nice //

This morning there was joy in my heart 'cause I know that I loved u so
Scrambled eggs, are so boring, 4 u're all, all that I want 2 know
Kisses never lie when delivered with milk from your lips
Morning glories never cry. My love for u, baby, drips

Life can be so nice. It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice. Life can be so nice. So nice

Life can be so nice

No one plays the clarinet the way u play my heart
I come a thousand different ways before I even start
U're so nice

Shivering madly... (Shivering madly in your embrace,)
Your embrace (is it better than a trip?)
Better than a trip (Morning glories never cry)
(My love is just a drippin')
Morning glories crying (Scrambled eggs are boring)
embrace (mama, u're all I want 2 know)
I do love u baby, (This morning there was joy in my heart)
u baby ('cause u know I loved u so. yeah)
(drips)

Alright

Life can be so nice. A wonderful world, paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice. Life can be so nice. So nice
Life can be so nice. A wonderful world, paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice. Life can be so nice. So nice. So nice

// Mountains //

Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
17 mountains stood so high.
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made u cry
U said the devil told u that another mountain would appear
Everytime somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would 1 day overflow with all your tears,
And love will always leave u lonely

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
happiness sometimes hard 2 find. (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air,
it's enough to make you want to lose your mind

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if u just believe (Oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, u and me

Guitars and drums on the 1

(Bobby on the drum - ah!)

It's only mountains (oh yeah) and the sea. (and the girls sing)
There's nothing greater, u and me

[starvation]

// Do U Lie? //

(Les enfants qui mentent ne vont pas au paradis)
[Translated: The children who lie don't go to paradise]

(Ok) Ok, Merci

When I lie awake in my boudoir I think of u dear
Do u think of me, or do u lie, do u lie?
When I'm in a sad and lonely mood dear, I cry 4 u dear (I cry 4 u)
Do you cry 4 me, do u cry, do u cry?

When I need someone 2 talk 2, u're not around
When I need another human's touch, I wear a frown
'cause u're uptown
Going down, going down, going down

I, I, I don't lie to u (i i don't lie)
When I say that I'm in love mama (mama, mama)
I feel so good when u're near (mama, mama)
Tell me do u feel it 2
Do u lie, do u lie? (or do u cry)
Do u cry from the inside out dear
Or are they only artificial tears? (artificial tears)
Do u really mean it when u cry,
When u cry, when u cry?

When I need someone 2 talk 2, (do u lie)
u're not around (u're not around)
u're not around (I wear a frown)
When I need (tell me why)
another human's touch,
I wear a frown (tell me why u wanna go)
Cause u're uptown (and leave me all alone)

Going down, going down, going down (goin' down)
Going down, going down, going down (down, down, down)
Going down, going down, going down (down, down, down)

When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of u)
I think of u dear (do u)
Do y'all think of me,
Or do u lie, do u lie?

// Kiss //

You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

[Muah muah muah muah muah]

Kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama
I know how to undress me (Yeah)
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

[Muah muah muah muah]

Kiss

Yes
I think I wanna dance
Gotta, Gotta
Little girl Wendy's parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama (Not your shoe size)
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food
Yeah

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

Kiss

// Anotherloverholenyohead //

I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable. I guess I gave u all of my time
And now u plead insanity and u don't even know the score
Why can't u learn 2 play the game?
Baby, don't u know that u need more? (More, more, more)

U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
that can do the duty in your bed, yeah

We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
U try 2 fight it (try 2 fight it)
U say you've had enough (say u've had enough)
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
u want another someone (u want another someone)
Yo happily ever after be (Sure as there's a sun)
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm gonna be the 1)
I'm gonna be the 1 and if (u don't understand)
u don't understand face to face, (face to face)
Baby I'll tell u down on my knee, yeah

U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
U know there ain't no other
that can do the duty in your bed
Solo, solo...

(sing it)

Oh Lord

U need another lover
U know there ain't no other
U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head
Hole in yo head. Hole in yo head
U need another lover like u need a hole, a hole, a hole, a hole
U need another lover
U know there ain't no other

There's gonna be a riot, if u don't clap your hands,
if u don't make that funky stand. Everybody.
U know there ain't no other

// Sometimes It Snows In April //

Tracy died soon after our long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here

I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past
