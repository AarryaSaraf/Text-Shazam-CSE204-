// My Name Is Prince //

(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy) (Prince)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy) (Prince)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only
I did not come 2 funk around
'Tll I get your daughter I won't leave this town
In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous I know from sin
I got 2 sides and they both friends
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much too fast
If u try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When u hear my music you'll be havin' fun
That's when I gottcha that's when u mine
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only - hurt me (You can't stop Prince)

(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody) (Prince)

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
Cuz I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2 day?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than u
But if u want 2 play with me, u better learn the rules

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
I did not come 2 funk around (You can't stop Prince)
'Till I get your daughter I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town
I won't leave this - leave this - leave this

My name is Prince and I am funky (You can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (You can't stop Prince)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, some....)

The funkier I be
The funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric
A new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this u're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D.I.C.K.
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was 2 big 4 u anyway
U're just a simpleton
I'll bust u like a pimple, son
My star is 2 bright
Boy, I'll sink u like the ship Poseidon Adventure
U're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
There must be more coming from
Your mouth than manure.
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
U must become a prince before u're king anyway

(Do that, do that somebody)
(Do that, do that somebody)

It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
U've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
In my cauldron. That means my nugget...
Sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin'
The other brothers buggin' and this is 4 those who oppose
And propose 2 overexpose disclose
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let u play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do u expect 2 win when u're used to playing craps?

(Do that, do that somebody)
Hell yeah, let's get this under the hmm...
(Do that, do that somebody)

"Damn." It's gettin' tricky
I mean it's a sticky situation
2 resurrect a groove with feeling
And give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party
While u're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
2 layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out...

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince the one and only

My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince

My name is Prince

Packing an ass as tight as a grape

Cuz I'm usually quite the calm one (Come on!)
You never found me out prowling boy

But I'm happy 2 change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would turn into sunshine

// Love 2 The 9's //

U say that u love me like river
A river u say'll never run dry
I'd rather hear u say 4 ever
Instead of a smile I'd rather see u cry
Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)

Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe u should have played an ace
Instead u played the queen
U'd be better off cheatin' than tryin'
2 read my mind

Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love

The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)

Dancing 2 the beat 'til we lose our mind control

Can I get a witness?
I'm lookin' 4 a lover with a body that says some mo'
I want 2 see the booty boom before I even let
Her get close enough 2 smell perfume

Ass piled high and deep u see

If the booty boom she gonna go with me
And then T. will whip out a 37 questionnaire and
Machine gun a sister like he just don't care
Machine gun a sister like he just got 2

How many kids u got - "Egads, I'm shocked!"
How many books u read - "Is Hemmingway dead?"
Well who's the President now - "Does it matter? Wow"
Then how u gonna make that booty boom?
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"
I say how u gonna make that booty boom
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom..."
"Step back, give a girl some room"

Dance girl - lemme see the booty boom

Would u hug me on a crowded street?
Could u keep your cool if I washed your feet?

What if I gave it, your body I ask
How long would u save it?
Could u lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink your ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other
Instead of smilin', would u cry?
Could u kiss 3 times with your dress upside
Downstroked and laughin'
Would u stay awake 4 4teen hours
Listenin' 2 the grass grow?

// The Morning Papers //

He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fanstasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the oceanside
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers

Let me play it for u one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks

Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Somebody help me sing it now

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Oh yes

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Go play

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Ok

// The Max //

Where are u?
U can relax now, the Max is in control
Go... yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max - We can dance if u want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live forever
I pay some overdues (Kick it)
When they start makin' up a crazy rule
That's when I break a back
Cuz when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby (oh yeah), tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (oh, yeah yeah)
The max - We can dance if u want 2 (ooh yeah), but I might break yo back
(2 the max)
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Oh, yeah yeah!

(Dig it) When my body starts to shiver from the chill of
The scarlett sweat
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
Reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces
Every one of the stallions in your pack - that's when
U go, u go, u go 2 the max. U go

The max (2 the max)
The max (oooh, get funky)
The max (get-get-get funky) (2 the max)
The max (get funky)

Let' go

Let's go (dance)

Let's go
Let's go (Oh yeah yeah!)

I go 2 the max
I'm not afraid (oh my god)
I wanna dance

Then listen -
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack
The max - We can dance if u want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck u can bet on that

This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love
Forgive me 4 my sins
But u left me in such a cold cold world to suffer in (kick it)
And Contrary 2 popular belief
Even though one's life is brief
If u go there once u
Come again and again and
Let's go

(I'm so sorry for u...)

This is the max

// Blue Light //

Oh well, here we are again
Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
I tell each and every one of my friends
That the love we make is really pretty rude
But they don't believe me cuz it's written all over my face
Like Evian and the deep blue sea
U and me got different taste
U like it in the dark but I like a
Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light

Then everything will be Alright
Oh, Blue light

U say u wish I was shy
I always take a simple thing and push it way 2 far
But baby, that's the problem with u and I
U say not in public but I say in the car
Say, we need to get wild again like it was when we first met
Close your eyes and count 2 ten and when u open 'em -
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on

Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then everything will be Alright
Oh, Blue light

I'll be 117
U'll be still sayin' "Baby not 2 nite"
It's easy 2 see us on the cover of a magazine
"Double heart attack, couple both die in a fight"
Oh Baby! I don't wanna cross that road cuz I love u 2 much
I'd do anything just 2 heat up your cold touch
Anything I would do, but up until u tell me 2

Blue light
Can u turn on a Blue light
Then cuddle up 2 me So tight
Just u and me All night
Alright,Blue light

Raise your cane (cane)
What do you believe in?
God
Who is your God?
U
Is this reality or just another facade?

// Arrogance //

Why are you so arrogant?
(Th....Th...There he is!)
(Th....There he is!)
(Th....Th...There he is!)

What makes a man wanna rule the world? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Make him man enough to say he's 50-50 girl (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
What makes a man wanna curse and swear? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Then blame it on heaven cuz he's already there
Pimprag, tootsie pop, and a cane

What makes a man wanna play guitar? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
Same thing that makes him wanna be a star (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
What makes him wanna see his name in lights? (A double A double arrogance)
(u got it)
...it was the same thing that made Eve take the 1st bite
Pimprag, tootsie pop, and a cane

(Don't make me get up) (There he is, get him) (Don't make me get up)
Like a flame she came and I was no longer cold
That's a little shady, for this lady was only 16 years old.

// The Flow //

Contradiction, my prediction is that...
Is it really important where I take my naps? (no)
Or who I sleep with? People with a real mind
Will peep this out, (yo, out)
Oops, then there goes your clout
Another fool don't know what she's talkin' about
Like the woman who tried 2 approach and
Attempt 2 roast and even boast about (what)
How she know me when. Damn, here we go again (what he say?)
U never went 2 school as far as I know
And now u're tryin' 2 say that u're writing a bio about me? (kick their ass)
Girl - I hate 2 say this - nigga please (tell 'em)
I go places that u never go
Ask what I'm kickin', I'm kickin' the flow
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Just like u're supposed 2 do (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Don't kill me please)

No, no, I ain't gonna kill u man (Just like u're supposed 2 do)
Tony, shoot that piece of shit...

Just give me the beat and something 2 flow on
And before long I have 'em bobbin' their jugheads
2 this funky song
Yeah, we're watching people scatter 2 the dance floor
Slammin' and shakin' their booties
Screamin' yo T, give me more (more)
So more is what I give 'em
NPG rockin' the track
Yo' tell me how we're livin' (livin' large, T)
U damn right, that's how it be (I see)
Gotta keep it that way
So that 5-0 can't find me and I'm sneakin'
Up the back of a pack of rats
They thought I was asleep, but I'm sayin'
It ain't all that (No!)
Not with a 9 fadin' my back
I don't hang with the hat pack (Bang!)
I'm runnin' silent - solo black
Sleek neat creepin' gangk peepin'
Known 2 put a damn fool 2 sleep
Who pulls a cheap one (whatcha do?)
That's when I change my speed
And flow on then I start
Slippin' and skippin' and jumpin' around
So much I say bring it on

Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Just like u're supposed 2 do (mpls, mpls) (2 many neighbors)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Just like u're supposed 2 do (...speak english...)

(to the bridge)

(Ladies and gentleman)
(Ladies and gentleman)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W.
Just like u're supposed 2 do
(Ladies and gentleman)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W.
Just like u're supposed 2 do
Rock, rock, rock, rock

// 7 //

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die
All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (1,2,3,4 - 1,2,3,4)
But behold, we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, 6 others will curse me
But that's alright, (that's alright)
4 I will watch them fall(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

[(Just how old)]

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their 7 tears, but do not fear
4 in the distance, 12 souls from now
U and me will still be here - we will still be here

There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a, there will be no death 4 with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All 7 and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and u are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time, so don't cry
One day all 7 will die

(Just how old)
(Just how old)
(Just how old)

// And God Created Woman //

In a deep sleep I fell
And the music starts 2 swell
One of my ribs He took and it shall be
Bone of my bones (bone of my bones)
And God created woman
And we were naked and did not care
There's a time 2 take and a time 2 share
2 in love, all around and all aware
Flesh of my flesh (flesh of my flesh)
And God created woman

Temptation sweet and so much (sweet and so much)
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch (shall ye touch)
Then again we could die from the rush (rush)
Heart of my heart (heart of my heart)
And God created woman (woman)

Woman
My-my-my-my-my-my woman

In my darkest hour I find
Many serpents who have lied (lied)
Given half the chance still I'd run 2 your side (run 2 your side)
Love of my love (love of my love)
And God created woman (woman)

And if I never see u again
It's alright 4 I am guilty of no sin
They can have u, I'll have your love in the end
Soul of my soul (soul of my soul)
And God created woman

(God created woman)
(God created woman) (woman)
Flesh of my flesh
(God created woman) (soul)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created, God created woman)
(God created woman)

// 3 Chains O' Gold //

If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life
U say u'll call me and then and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Coupled with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
With the undertaker, which one will it be?
U can cry 4 ever, but u'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

Give back the chains - if you don't you will die
Nothing should come between you and I

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4 ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me

If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me
(3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4 ever)
Cuz I sho 'nuff say u will

(3 chains o' gold)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)

I've got 3 chains o' gold
They gonna shine...

Forever, forever, forever

(3 chains o' gold)

Cord wrapped around my neck
Epileptic 'til the age of 7
I was sure heaven marked the deck

From a man with a strap in his hand

1967 in a bus marked public schools
Rode me and a group of unsuspecting political tools
Our parents wondered what it was like 2 have another color near
So they put their babies together 2 eliminate the fear
We sacrifice
Yes we did, fighting one another
We sacrifice
Go on say it preacher
All because of color
The angel of hate - she taught me how 2 kick her
If she called me anything but Victor (u mean like nigger?)
If the only thing that tells me is father time
Then sacrifice is the mutha sublime - we love it

Listen mutha - we sacrifice

Go on... go on... go on say it preacher

We sacrifice

Well, well, well, well

What is sacrifice?
Hold yo' text, deacon

Never understood my old friends laughing
They got high when everything else got wrong (pass the booze up here)
Dr. King was killed and the streets they started burnin'
When the smoke was cleared, their high was gone
Education got important, so important 2 Victor
A little more important than ripple and weed
Bernadette's a lady, and she told me (what she say?)
"Whatever u do son, a little discipline is what u need,
Is what u need, u need to sacrifice"

We sacrifice
I know joy lives 'round the corner

But we got something
Heavy on our minds (we sacrifice)

Sometimes, u gotta leave the one u love
Somebody, anybody, everybody wave your hand
Around the corner, there's another sacrifice (joy around the corner)
But u got 2 do the best u can y'all (we sacrifice)
Say u got 2 go through it (go through it)
U got 2 go through it all (go through it all)
High glory, yeah
Sell it, don't tell it, don't tell me (joy around the corner)
[?] nice at my feet
Lord I might get tired,
But I, I've got 2 keep on (we sacrifice)
Walkin' down this road, (we sacrifice)
Keep on walkin' down this road (joy around the corner)
When I reach my destination (we sacrifice)
My name will be Victor

Amen
