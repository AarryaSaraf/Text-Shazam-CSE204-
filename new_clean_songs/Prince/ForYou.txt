Album: ForYou

// For You //

All of this and more is for you
With love, sincerity and deepest care
My life with you I share

// In Love //

Ever since I met you, baby
I've been wantin' to lay you down
But it's so hard to get you
Baby, when you never come around
Every day that you keep it away
It only makes me want it more
Ooh baby, just say the word
And I'll be at your door

What more do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

Ever since I met you, baby
There's been somethin' inside of me
That keeps me wantin' you
Baby, won't you set me free?
Take off these chains, girl
And I'll take off yours
There's no one in the world, baby
That I wanna love more

What else do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin' baby, deeper everyday
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
(In love)
And I'm fallin' baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(In love)
I'm drownin' baby, in my love for you
(In love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
I just don't, I don't know what to say

In love
In love
Oh baby-girl, you're takin' me away
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby
In love
In love

// Soft And Wet //

Hey, lover, I got a sugar cane
That I want to lose in you
Baby, can you stand pain
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby

All I want to see is the love in you eyes
And all I want to hear is your sweet love
Hey lover, it's a golden flame
Tell me, tell me baby that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me girl

We'd be so lost
In our mouths
The best
I feel it every day
You feel so wrong
Been alone
If you just follow somebody, someday

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you
You just love me to death
Oh, wee, baby
You leave me without
Breath, oh baby
Ooh, yeah

You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
Hey, lover, will you call my name
Your love is driving me
You're driving me insane

Crazy, baby, oh
Crazy about your love

Soft and wet
You know you are
Soft and wet
Oh, sugar, you know you are
Soft and wet
Ooh...
Soft and wet

// Crazy You //

You have got a strange way about you
Kinda' crazy but I love you just the same
Because you, oh you make me wanna do, oh everything

I'm just a crazy fool, lost in the world of love
I get from crazy you, oh, I'm so strung out
Thinking 'bout the crazy things you do, crazy you

// Just As Long As We're Together //

You can live your own life and I'll live mine
I will never try to keep you down
And even if I only see you some of the time
I'm just happy when you come around
And even if the sun don't shine

I'm warm enough when
You're in these arms of mine
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Nothing that will break us apart
Girl, I gotta always have you in my ear
Gotta always have you in my heart
Oh baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine

Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, there's nothing better
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doing what you what me to
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing that melody, sugar

Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright

Don't you know there ain't better oh

// Baby //

Baby, what are we gonna do?
I'm so in love with you
Baby, what are we gonna do?
I know you're in love with me too

Should we go on livin' together
Or should we get married right away?
Whatever you decide, I'll still love you, baby
An' we'll grow stronger everyday

Baby, what are we gonna do?
I barely have enough money for two
Baby, what are we gonna do?
I don't want to regret what I've done to you

I never would've thought that this would happen
To a very careful man like me
But baby, pretty baby, we're gonna work it out, yeah
I love you, I love you, can't you see?

Baby, baby, baby
It's you, said it's you, I truly adore
Baby, baby, we're gonna work it out
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours

// My Love Is Forever //

You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time
(All the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just hard to be

You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you
(Need you)

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever

Sugar, I don't have to dream
'Cause you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
(Love you)

Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
Never, never stop wanting you
Never, never get enough of you, love is forever

You are the only thing that keeps me goin'
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, my love is forever

// So Blue //

I had everything I needed
But now my life is so blue
You meant the world to me
But now you're gone and I'm so blue

Even though the sun is shining
I spend my day, I spend my day crying over you
Oh yeah, I spend my day crying over you
I feel just like the sky, oh, so blue

Oh baby, don't you know?
Baby don't you know?
I spend my nights, it's all alone
Talking to myself, I am so blue

And everyday the feeling gets stronger
And who's to say, just how much longer
I can spend my nights all alone

Talking to myself and just crying over you
I guess I'll just spend my life
So, so blue

// I'm Yours //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up until the other day
There remained an empty space within my bed
Then I took one look at you
And naughty things that we could do

I took one look at you
And all the things that we could do
Dance within my head

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea, I'm yours

I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything you want
You're the teacher, show me how

Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yea
I'm yours
