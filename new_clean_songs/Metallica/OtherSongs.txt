// Human //

Don't you leave me, Father Time
Take me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again... woooah

You got to breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing
Minus Human
Please squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again... woooah

You got to breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for Air

You got to breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for Air
Breathe, man, breathe!
Coming up for!

// No Leaf Clover //

And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy....

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said.....

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way

Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Sucker for that quick reward boy
Sucker for that quick reward they said.....

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just the freight train coming your way......
It's coming your way
It's coming your way......
Here comes

Yeah, Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Is just a freight train coming your way.... Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah...
Then it comes to be, Yeah

// The Mechanix //

Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Your a burner yeah a real motor car

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you

Who ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons buldge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end ya know it feels too slow

I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love

// The New Song (Death Is Not The End) //

Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round

Open up your gate
Spirit dilate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dilate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the beginning
It's a...

Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves

Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dilate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dilate
Go tell all Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the beginning

I've been a rambler, the light changes me
I've been a rambler, the light sets me free

Sets me free

Yeah!

I've been a rambler the light sets me free
I've been a gambler the light sets me free

Sets me free

Haha!

Man in black comes around
Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Dearly beloved
We gathered here today
To say goodbye to our old selves

Open up your gate
Spirit dilate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirit Dilate
Go Tell all Your Friend
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
Its the beginning

Death is not the end!

// Vulturus //

Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah oh

The vultures come
See the vultures come for me
Fly around the sun
But now too late for me
Just sit and stare
Wait 'til I hit the ground
Little vultures tear
Little vultures tear at flesh

[Chorus:]
Vulture is down to stay
Pick the bone until you're clean
Bone to bone and in between
Pick the bone until you're clean

Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah oh woah

[Solo]

Right without soul
I rummage high and low
Search for my soul
Search though I'm high above
We leave behind
Too late, too late again
I just want to search the soul
But my soul is flesh and bone again

[Chorus]

Woah oh
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah woah
Woah oh woah

Vulturus
Search on Vulturus
Vulturus

[Solo]

Vulturus
Search on Vulturus
Vulturus
Search on

Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh

[Chorus]

Woah oh yeah
Woah oh
Woah yeah
Woah oh yeah
Woah oh woah!

Vulturus!
