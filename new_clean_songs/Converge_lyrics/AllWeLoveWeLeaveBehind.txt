Album: AllWeLoveWeLeaveBehind

// Aimless Arrow //

To live the life you want
You've abandoned those in need
A necessary casualty
Or so you believe
Your wake will always travel
And well up in the eyes
Of those that you sacrificed
In order to survive
I'm that aimless arrow
Lost from my very start
Violence without purpose
Born of broken hearts
No one will ever guide me
As I sail through the air
Now I just bring sadness
In those who choose to care
I know the tears they're weeping
And the damage they will take
It's the curse of restlessness
And the weight of your mistakes
They are those that love you
And those that need you more
Then the sense of gravity
Banging down your door
I'm that aimless arrow
Lost from my very start
Violence without purpose
Born of broken hearts
No one will ever guide me
As I sail through the air
Now I just bring sadness
To those who choose to care
Aimless arrow
Aimless arrow
Aimless arrow
Lost from the start

// Trespasses //

See, I've grown to find the same old sun
Erases shadows, devours light
We burn - we burn at both ends
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
What a cruel world clarity brings
We burn - we burn at both ends
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
Some just gave up in the end
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
They just gave up in the end
Nothing will bring peace
Nothing will bring rest
And I've grown to find the same old sun
Erases shadows, devours light
We burn - we burn at both ends
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
What a cruel world clarity brings
We burn - we burn at both ends
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
Some just gave up in the end
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
They just gave up in the end
Nothing will bring peace
Nothing will bring rest
Death and loss blossoms, within the wound
Life and love writhing, writhing in you
A new day rise in me
Burn at both ends
Stayed up those nights to see
Burn at both ends
What the future could mean
Burn at both ends
Stayed up those nights to see
Burn at both ends
A new day rise in me

// Tender Abuse //

When you chose to hurt the honest ones
They scarred effortlessly
Fading - felt but never seen
Something lost and nothing gained
This damage still looks the same
Darkness gets in the way
What I feel, I cannot say
When you chose to love all the wrong ones
I bruised beautifully
Fading - felt but never seen
When you chose to hurt the honest ones
They scarred effortlessly
Fading - felt but never seen
Something lost and nothing gained
This damage still looks the same
Darkness gets in the way
What I feel, I cannot say
It's my blood that's drowning me
My gift to you
Sweet tender abuse

// Sadness Comes Home //

There's no such thing as good enough
For arctic eyes and hard earned rust
I've grown tired of counting odds
To somehow make things even
When sadness always comes home
Sadness comes home
Sadness comes home
Cursed to be your second best
This amber soul will find no rest
I've grown tired of standing up
When every one just gives in
When sadness always comes home
Sadness comes home
Sadness comes home
I take so little and I bleed so much
My hand me down heart is out of luck
I take so little and I bleed so much
My hand me down heart is out of luck
No such thing as good enough
For arctic eyes and hard earned rust
I've grown tired of counting odds
To somehow make things even
When sadness always comes home

// Empty On The Inside //

Empty on the inside
Searching - for all my life
Empty on the inside
Aching - for all my life
Empty on the inside
Hunting - for all my life
What made me whole is slipping through my hands
Youth leaves us all as this death commands
And I can't shake these beasts from my bones
It's their rabid hunger that built me this home
And it sickens me to say this is the only way
But if it hurts you I know it must be true
Empty on the inside
Searching - for all my life
Empty on the inside
Aching - for all my life
Empty on the inside
Hunting - for all my life
I am empty

// Sparrow's Fall //

The sparrow fell from it's perch
From the dead weight of this earth
His precious held life long dreams
Were someone else's old misgivings
Don't live as the echo
But thrive as the sound
The boy dug deep with his hands
Only to find poisoned lands
And all he could carry all he could take
Were our legacies of hand me down mistakes
The fruits of our tears rot at the vine
Not enough heart not enough time
No right answers to their wrong ways
When we inherit our graves
(Don't) live as the echo
But thrive as the sound
(Don't) live as the echo
But thrive as the sound
Don't let your future
Writhe in our past
Don't let your future
Writhe in our past
Don't let your future
Writhe in our past
Don't let your future
Writhe in our fucking past

// Glacial Pace //

My love, wrap your hands around my heart
Free me from the frost that enveloped my life
My love, reach out your arms and pull me close
Let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
My love, wrap your hands around my heart
Free me from the frost that enveloped my life
My love, reach out your arms and pull me close
Let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
If being alive is just to survive
I'd choose to drown in the turbulent seas
If being alive is just to survive
A glacial pace comes to an end
It brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
A glacial pace comes to an end
Let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
If being alive is just to survive
I'd sink within you for eternity
A glacial pace comes to an end
And it brings on the floods that are the truest of tests
A glacial pace comes to an end
Let our love guide us through the torrents ahead
Don't give up on me
My love, wrap your hands around my heart
Free me from the frost that enveloped my life
My love, reach out your arms and pull me close
Let us tread in silence as their world drowns beneath
A glacial pace
A glacial pace
A glacial pace
A glacial pace

// No Light Escapes //

Don't let go
Don't leave me
Don't let go
Don't leave me
As I cried for you
Her lips were calling to you
Don't let go
Don't leave me
Don't let go
Don't leave me
As I reached for you
Cold hands were embracing you
Death can touch what we love
Death will touch what we love
Don't let go

// Vicious Muse //

What kind of vicious muse
Broke the both of you?
Why did your golden hearts
Effortlessly bruise?
How did that waning spark
Fade to black and blue?
(Just) name the demons, overhead
The same names as old forgotten friends
To remind you that who you love
Will cut your throats in the end
(Just) name the demons, overhead
The same names as old forgotten friends
You see they will never leave
Your blood soaked bed
How you will grieve will set you free
How you will grieve will set you free
What kind of vicious muse
Broke the both of you?
Why did your golden hearts
Effortlessly bruise?
How did that waning spark
Fade to black and blue?
A vicious muse

// Veins And Veils //

Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes
Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes
Bring brave got in the way
Of recognizing missteps we've made
So we said goodbye to moonlit eyes
And met the morning and its flood of light
Gripped the thorns of the rose
Cherished the beautiful pain it holds
Something so fragile and flawed
At least we know it's pure
Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes
Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes
Being brave got in the way
Of recognizing missteps we've made
So we said goodbye to moonlit eyes
And met the morning and its flood of light
Gripped the thorns of the rose
To cherish the beautiful pain it holds
Something so fragile and flawed
At least we know it's pure
Blood in my veins
Says it's never too late
Blood in my veins
Says it's never too late
Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes
Veins and veils have their place
As a way out of our past mistakes

// Coral Blue //

Swam out to sea
To try and be me
To drown those that
Thought they could never sink
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
Coral blue grows in you
Coral blue tells the truth
Swam out to see
What karma would bring
It's jaws crashed down
On drowning bodies around me
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
Coral blue grows in you
Coral blue tells the truth
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read
When in the deep
Weakness is easy to read

// Shame In The Way //

Sadness fills up our lungs
Their flesh hangs on our broken horns
Strays lay claim to shame in the way
A currency that once adorned
The blinding beauty of our world
Strays lay claim to shame in the way
Strays lay claim to shame in the way
Alone we wander
Our hunger guides us true
Our footsteps shake your ground
So let blood flood this valley
Carved from years of constant tears
It's the shadows that are leading me
From my youth to the tomb
It's the absence of a purpose
That turns me into you
Head over heels with our wounds
Yet we search for more to lose
Shame in the way
Strays lay claim to shame in the way

// On My Shield //

All of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno, because I would rather
I would rather, die on my shield
Die on my shield
All of the wounded that need to be saved
Looked for a handout beyond the gates
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno and burn down to the bone
All of the arrows that plunge into prey
Are their promises of better days
And I need to know if their blood was worth it
As we live this inferno, because I would rather
Die on my shield
I would rather die on my shield
Die on my shield
Die on my shield
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
Love's war rages on
All of our pain is worth it
Together we fall apart
All of our pain is worth it
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together we fall apart
Together

// All We Love We Leave Behind //

Your roar of love
Slayed my despair
It ripped me from my path
That led me to nowhere
You shook me from my sleep
That willed me to die
A final goodbye
All we love we leave behind
I'm so sorry
That I missed your lives
While I was on the road
Learning to survive
You deserved so much more
Than I could ever provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behind
Nothing in this world
Could ever compare
To the hole in my heart
And the weight in the air
When you took to the sky
And I lost you to time
A final goodbye
All we love we leave behind
I'm so sorry
That I missed your lives
While I was on the road
Learning to survive
You deserved so much more
Than I could provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behind
You deserved so much more
Than I could provide
Thank you for loving me
And bringing light to my eyes
All we love we leave behind

// Runaway //

Stripped my heart of all it's parts
And gave away the scrap for free
Sold your soul for some control
To gnaw at the hand that feeds
Crying out to end the drought
Yet it's not your blood that filled this sea
The mistakes left in your wake
They remind me of a younger me
Parasites have come and gone
And this is your farewell song
Parasites have come and gone
And this is your farewell song
Run - run
Stripped my heart of all it's parts
And gave away the scrap for free
Sold your soul for some control
To gnaw at the hand that feeds
Crying out to end the drought
Yet it's not your blood that filled this sea
The mistakes left in your wake
They remind me of a younger me
Parasites have come and gone
And this is your farewell song
Parasites have come and gone
And this is your farewell song
Run - run
Run - run away

// Predatory Glow //

I've found myself
Running out of time
Relating to those that
Just stopped trying
Clinging to those little things
And the light they bring
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Scavengers became
Future romancers
And my angels carry
A predatory glow
I'm weaker by the way
No way to be saved
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
Emptiness
Drags me down
To the depths
With no sound
It's what I lack
That attracts (me)
To the jaws
Of defeat
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Mend me
End me
Let the future know
I won't be there tomorrow
Let the past know
I gave them my all
I'm aching for an end
Grown thinner every day
I bow down to you
Extinguished youth
