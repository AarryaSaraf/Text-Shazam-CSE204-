Album: AxeToFall

// Dark Horse //

For all those born to serve
And those that chose to hide
Let their sadness be our blessing
Let their losses lead the way

The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
Dark horse will come

For all those born to die
And those that lost the fight
Let their hard roads be our way out
Let their passion lead the way

The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
Dark horse will come

No matter the man or the machine
Beasts will become what they were meant to be
In the name of lovers, in the name of wars
We'll show the demons for what they are

Dark horse ride
Towards the light
Dark horse ride
Onward

Towards the light
Onward

// Reap What You Sow //

Barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
Idle hands inherit spoiled lands
Hungry become the pigs

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave

Laying with lions to hide my grief
From the beast that never sleeps
Our tired hearts tear us apart
Searching for the key

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of youth

Reap what we sow

Barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
Idle hands inherit spoiled lands
Hungry become the pigs

We reap, we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of...
We reap, we sow

// Axe To Fall //

Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall

Sun is sinking, clouds collecting
In a race to stop the bleeding
My will is leaving, darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you

Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall

Sun is sinking, clouds collecting
In a race to stop the bleeding
My will is leaving, darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you

I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this suicide machine
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this destruction

I need to learn to love me
I need to learn to love me
To love me

// Effigy //

Rotting legacies
Fading loyalties

Effigies
For the beasts
Effigies

Distorted hearts worship god currency
That is so worthless to me
The poor eat the poor just like we've done before
Cursed by the burden youth brings

Rotting legacies
Fading loyalties

Effigies
For the beasts
Effigies

Distorted hearts worship god currency
That is so worthless to me
The poor eat the poor just like we've done before
Cursed by the burden youth brings

Effigies
For the beasts
Effigies
You and me
For you and me

// Worms Will Feed / Rats Will Feast //

Saw you coming around my bend
Cutting teeth and breaking bread
Making moves and smearing friends
Your karma has been racking debts

Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls of blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Worms will feed

Saw you slither around their necks
Sinking teeth into their flesh
Spitting venom, you're seeing red
You will fall where you lay your head

Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls from blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Rats will feast

The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way

The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way

// Wishing Well //

The collapsing veins are empty
The stars are less bright tonight
The future is moving farther away
From defeated eyes
Your words can't touch me
While your past weighs down your life
Your heart can't love me
While your past (still) haunts you inside
The past still hunts you
The past still follows you
You - all I had I gave to you
(We are echoes in the well)

// Damages //

Shut your doors, their storm is coming
Of unlived dreams cast away
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall

Shield innocence from hungry tombs
Keep damages from taking you
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall

I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall

// Losing Battle //

A triumph of tragedy
And all it claims from me
As those years recede
While lies are all I see
Missed steps and misgivings
Driven by frailty
What you call family
Feels so dead to me

Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you

A triumph of tragedy
And all it claims from me
As those years recede
While lies are all I see
Missed steps and misgivings
Driven by frailty
What you call family
Feels so dead to me

Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you

Losing the battle
Losing the war
Losing the battle
Losing the war

// Dead Beat //

Pick your poison as dead beats do
Leave a wake in the hearts that hurt you
Pick your poison as dead beats do
Blood pulsing through your wounds
A thousand warnings are ringing true
Burning their homes, writing in stone
The name of demons inside of you
You left your mark on this world
You left your scar on this world
You left your scar
You left your mark
Wound them

// Cutter //

Severed my roots of dead family trees
Finding the damage inside (of me)
Parting blood red seas on bended knee
Too much to ask when it's so hard to breathe
No way out
Tearing my soul to finally see
The real wreckage between (you and me)
A cold grin for these illegible door
My haywire heart, your product of war
No way out
Cutting myself for clarity
Jest keep falling
No way out, cutter
Cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling
One way down
No way out

// Slave Driver //

No longer feel you, no longer fear you
I've worked overtime in your cancer factories
Lived with those lies to make those loose ends meet
I've taken all my chances
And still I'm missing steps
Another losing battle
For those left for dead
I've fed their rabid feast
Yet still pick from my own bones
I've ripped out my own heart
Trying to keep you whole
I've lived like true angels
I've only learned to fall
I've sold myself to death
For nothing at all
No longer feel anyone
No longer fear anything
I've hung my sorrow on your promised apologies
I've left the nest
With broken/battered wings
The blood in my eyes has taught me to defeat
The beasts at the feet of saint obscurity
No longer feel
No longer fear

// Cruel Bloom //

Voracious children and wolves
Sharpen their teeth on our bones
Carrion feeds the wretched
Vacant eyes peer through the hole
Beggars and thieves bring down a common enemy
While pawnshop kings and corner queens
All hawk their souls for gold
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Trying so hard to find beauty in flesh torn from me
Trying so hard not to lose you
In cobwebs and empty hearts
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Witness the ghostlike shades of ourselves
Searching for any way out of our skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom

// Wretched World //

Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do

Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world

Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do

Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world

My wretched world
My wretched world
My wretched world

(To stand in your shadow is to be home)
