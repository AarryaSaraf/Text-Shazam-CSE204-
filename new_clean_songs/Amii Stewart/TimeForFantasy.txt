// Dusty Road //

Carry on bear the heavy load on a dusty road
Got to win the race
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain
Like the blackbird flying in the night
What it's doing here
Searching for the way
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain

It's a typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream
And watch it bending

In my dark years
Don't you stray away from the dusty road
Keep your own two feet
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain
Lots of people are going to put you down
But does it bother you?
Don't let them change your mind, oh no
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain

It's a typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream
And watch it bending
Oh, typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream

And keep your feelings on the move
When you know the fight is over
And you can tell them all
If you wanna get where you're going
Don't get lost on the road

Steppin' down, movin' right along
Loneliness forgotten, don't get lost on the road

// It's You And Me //

I'll never find the words to tell you
I never find the words to say
I never thought I'd feel the way I'm feeling now
When I look at you it's all the way

With you now I've come so far
Changed my way of living
Made the bad times, good times once again
Now I'm free from the crazy years
Living through so many changes
The loneliness and tears

It's you and me, now I see
I couldn't make it through the day without you
It's you and me and I never mean to hide
The way I feel inside now can't you see
That it's you and me

This world keeps spinning round through time
And you say I run too fast
Caught up in the future
Take for granted love will always last
Baby please
I've waited far too long
Never cared about tomorrow
Until you came along

It's you and me
Take a look and see
I couldn't make it through the day without you
It's you and me and I never mean to hide
It's just my foolish pride now can't you see
That it's you and me

People smile they love to call you friend
But darling in the end
The heart goes some place else
Searching for that someone goes on and on
In search of love

Said it's you and me and I never mean to hide
The way I feel inside now can't you see
That it's you and me

// It's Fantasy //

Please come back to me
Oh fantasy
I'm so in love with you
I hear music
Mystic melodies
For you and me
All that we can be
Together

Te so fa tua
Oh fantasy
Now we are one
Dream to carry on
Lying here
Still
Beside me

Fly on a breeze
Silently
While all the world's asleep
Making love
In a house of Venus

Please, come back to me
Oh fantasy
I am so in love with you
I hear music
Mystic melodies
For you and me
All that we can be
Together

When we're alone like this
A tender kiss
Fills my heart
With happiness
The way it ought to be
In fantasy
Loving you forever
Ever...

I want you to be
The fantasy

Touched by the light
In the darkness of the night
There's a power that'll burn
Within me
You gotta take care
Be aware
We were at the point of no return
You got scared
And we fell down from heaven
Heaven

Please, come back to me
Oh fantasy...
