// The Letter //

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby just wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I've gotta spend
Long as I'm back with my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby just wrote me a letter

Well, he wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me anymore
Please, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more anyway

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby, he wrote me a letter

I said my baby just wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter

My baby, my baby
My baby, he wrote me a letter!

Well, he wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me anymore
Please, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more anyway

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm coming home
My baby wrote me a letter

(My baby wrote me a letter)
My baby wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
My baby wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote a letter)
Letter, letter, letter, letter, letter, letter, letter
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
My baby just wrote me a letter
I said my baby just wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote a letter)
My baby just wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
My baby just wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote a letter)
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
Letter, letter
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
Letter, letter
(My baby wrote a letter)
(My baby wrote a letter, letter)
Letter, letter
(My baby wrote me a letter)

(A letter)
Letter, letter, letter, letter, letter, letter, letter
(A letter)
Letter, letter, letter
(A letter)

Well, she wrote me a letter
That she couldn't live without me anymore
Please, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more

Well, she wrote me a letter
That she couldn't live without me anymore
Can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby!

Wrote me a letter, wrote me a letter!
Wrote me a letter, wrote me a letter!
Wrote me a letter!

(A letter)
(A letter)
(A letter)

Wrote me a letter, wrote me a letter!
Wrote me a letter, wrote me a letter!
Wrote me a letter!

// Paradise Bird //

Paradise bird, fly away

What have I gotta do
To keep a hold on you?
Don't ever let me tie you down
I know you've gotta choose, why don't you?
And if you have to go, let's break up now

Maybe I can understand
Why you're acting underhand
Sometimes I ask too much of you
I don't want you to go, but I know
You've found a horizon calling out to you

Paradise bird, fly away
Fly away
Paradise bird, fly away

Seems like only yesterday
You were begging me to stay
You tried so hard to change my mind
Funny how the tables turned round and around
Paradise bird, you're hard to find

Paradise bird, you're hard to find
Paradise bird, you're hard to find
Fly away, fly away

Paradise bird, so far away
Paradise bird

Seems like only yesterday
You were begging me to stay
You tried so hard to change my mind
Funny how the tables turned
Round and around
Paradise bird, you're hard to find

Paradise bird, so hard to find
Paradise, you're hard to find

Fly away, fly away
Fly, fly
Oh, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away

// He's A Burglar //

Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar

He's a burglar
He broke into my mind
He's a burglar
Took everything he could find
He looked into my eyes
And knew I was defenseless
He stole a glance to my surprise
His charms they left me senseless

Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

He's a burglar
He stole my peace of mind
He's a burglar, yeah
I was fooled by his cool lies
Now I was standing helpless
Lost all of my control
He smiled at me with burnin' lips
And then he stole my soul

Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

He's a burglar
He never needs a key
He's a burglar
And he's still runnin' free
I held him in my arms
And heard him call my name
And while he sweet talked me
He paralysed my brain

He's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

Burglar
He's a burglar
Burglar
Ooh, he's a burglar
Burglar
Broke into my mind
Burglar
Everything he could find

Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar
Burglar

// Jealousy //

As I look into your eyes
I see the doubts and realize
You saw me with a friend we share
You take it as a love affair

You got a hold on me, a guarantee
I don't wanna lose you
But the more I'm free
The less I'd be likely to deceive you

Jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy) Is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

You may play this lover's game
Pretending that you feel no pain
Thinking that you're hurting me
But you're the casualty

You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy) Is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealous, jealous, jealousy

But you're the casualty
You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

If you read between the lines
Or question all my alibis
You may think you know it all
But who can tell when lovers fall?

You've got a hold on me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

Jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

(Jealousy) it'll get you nowhere
(Jealousy) it'll get you nowhere
(Jealousy) I'm begging you to throw away
Jealous, jealous of me
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna be
(Jealousy)
I'm begging you to throw away your jealousy
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
Oh jealousy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealous, jealous, jealousy

(Jealousy) Our love is gone, our love is gone
Our love is gone, gone, gone, gone (Jealousy)
(Jealousy) Our love is gone, our love is gone
Our love is gone, gone, gone, gone (Jealousy)

(Jealousy) Our love is gone, our love is gone
Our love is gone (Jealousy)
(Jealousy) Our love is gone, our love is gone
Our love is gone, gone, gone (Jealousy)

(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)
(Jealousy)

// Right Place, Wrong Time //

I'm at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?

Don't wanna say hello
But I sure would like to know what happened to ya?
Sip on a julip, their playin' our music
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love
But it wasn't good enough, you were ambitious
So dedicated
You should have waited

You're at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

Nobody understood
Why we always knock on wood when a love please us
So superstitious
We play to our wishes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love, oh
I gave you love

So dedicated
You should've waited

We're at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you...

Don't wanna say hello
But I sure would like to know what happened to ya?
Sip on a julip, their playin' our music
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love
But it wasn't good enough
So dedicated
You should have waited

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you...

We're at the right place
(At the wrong time)
At the wrong time

(You should've stayed, you should've stayed, you should've stayed)

// Step Into The Love Line //

Ooh, if your love is only me
I'll never give that guarantee
You got it all wrong if you think I belong to you
That doesn't mean that I would say I wasn't fond of you

Love is the fool who tried in vain
(If your love, if your love is only me)
Who suffered time and time again
(If your love, if your love is only me)
Just because I said that I would spend the night with you
That doesn't mean that I would say I was in love with you

(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
(Step into the love line)
Step, step
Hold on to the love sign

Love is the fire that feeds the flame
(If your love, if your love is only me)
I touched the fire and felt the pain
(If your love, if your love is only me)

You got it all wrong if you think I belong to you
Doesn't mean that I would say I wasn't fond of you

(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on, hold on

(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
If your love
(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
If your love is only me
