Album: InsideYou

// Inside You, Pt. 1 & 2 //

Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on 
Read my mind and I know you'll find
I wanna be inside you baby.

There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me baby
Stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on
All I know is what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby

There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby

Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on
There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me baby

Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby

// Baby Hold On //

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, he's tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now

When he tries
Please don't let him
My advice will be
Better forget him

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

I don't blame him, baby
You're so fine
If he thinks he's gonna get you
He's out of his mind

Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
