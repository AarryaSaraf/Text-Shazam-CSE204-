// Calm It Down //

[Serengeti:]
All right
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Jumping
And bumping
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Sending telegram
After telegram
And when you feel like throwing (All right)
All your books in the air
You need to catch it
Just catch it
When you feel
Like you just can't stop (Can't stop)
Twisting and turning
And burning shit (wait a second, wait a second)

[Hook:]
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down

[Segue:]
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-calm it down
C-c-c-c-c-c-

[Serengeti:]
And when you feel (Like what?)
Like you just can't stop (Why's that? Why's that?)
Chasing your dreams
Impossible dreams
Impossible dreams
And when you feel
Like driving your car (Nope, nope)
Into a telephone pole
Just stop it
You got it (Hit the brakes)
And when you feel (Come on)
Like fucking shit up (Yeah)
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up (See what happens if...)
And when you feel (How do you feel?)
Like you just can't stop (My bad)
Talking shit about each other
All the time
All the time

[Hook:]
You need to calm it down (Calm it down)
Calm it down (You need to calm it down)
You need to calm it down (You need to calm it down)
You need to calm it down (Calm it down)
You need to calm it down (Calm it down)
Calm it down (Yo, take it down)
You need to calm it down (You need to calm it down)
Calm it down (Just take it easy)
You need to calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
Calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down

[Bridge:]
When your fists don't fly (Yeah, calm it down)
When your grips don't got (OK, calm it down)
When your twerps don't tweak (You gotta calm it down)
When your perps don't peep (All right, calm it down)
When your hips don't dip (Yeah, calm it down)
And the kicks don't hit (Calm it down)
When your ships don't ship (OK, calm it down)
When your life don't life (Just calm it down)
When your mix don't match (How about calming down?)
When your rips don't patch (Take it easy)
When your keys don't lock (Just relax)
When your beats don't knock (OK, OK, yeah)
When your dogs don't bite (Calm it down)
When your bull don't fight (Just take it easy)
When your time stands still (Just calm it down)
Can you tell me how you feel? (Just)

[Sufjan Stevens (Serengeti):]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Was it the drugs I take?
(You need to calm it down)
Was it ambitious outbreak?
(You need to calm it down)
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Shall I account for peace?
(You need to calm it down)
Shall I resist it my way?
(You got to calm it down)
Mine is the glory (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the praise (You got to calm it down)
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down)
Now that I feel that shame
I've got every reason to persuade (Calm it down)
Mine is the problem (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the pain (You got to calm it down)

[Son Lux:]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
Was it the drugs I take?
Was it ambitious outbreak?
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
Shall I account for peace?
Shall I resist it my way?
Mine is the glory
Mine is the praise
Now that I feel the shame
I've got every reason to persuade
Mine is the problem
Mine is the pain

// Take Me //

[Hook x2 - Sufjan Stevens:]
Love
Take me to your room
I want to be your friend

[Sufjan:]
Will you walk me home at night?
Will you send me showers of light?
I want to be your friend

Will you kiss me on the lips?
Will you fill my lunar eclipse?
I want to be your friend

Will you touch me in the car?
Will you say that I am your star?
I want to be your friend

Will you keep me safe from harm?
Will you hold me close in your arms?
I want to be your friend

[Hook x2]

And I have no appetite
And I can not sleep through the night
I want to be your friend

I've got pictures in my head
My own thought of you in my bed
I want to be your friend

With terror you may find
For I fear I'm losing my mind
I want to be your friend

And my heart is such a mess
And I feel that I am possessed
I want to be your friend

[Hook x5]

// Booty Call //

[Serengeti:]
Read it, cheat it, do you want to beat it?
Do you ever think a motherfucker eat it?
Feed it, stampede it, don't cheat it
Is it one of those things at the rodeo bar where you say you don't delete it?
I don't ever want to say I don't believe it
Get your arms untied, can you open real wide?
I don't ever want to say I'm undefeated
Can you run on your own?
Can you huddle with the Capricorn?
Are you still afraid of the storm?
Do you want to make a porn?
(Nah)
What day, what month were you born?
Me, I'm a Cancer
Got all the answers
Catch me on the flip, I'm a motherfucking dancer
Beat it, don't tweet it, cheat it
Feed it, put it in your mouth, eat it
Got a taste in my mouth, can I go to your house?
It's a little bit south of the city
Do you really have a kitty?
Talk to me lover, can you tell me what's your name?
Beauty, computy let me see that booty
Let me be your call of duty
Tell me heart
"Get it off I don't want to get sauced"
Do you want to be my lover?
Do you want to be discovered?
Like Venus
Have you seen it?
Can you dream it?
(Yeah)
Do you really think I need it?
Beam me up Scotty, your a motherfucking genius
Do you really want to eat it?
Stop
Why are you acting all defeated?
Did you put your heart in a boy who beat it?
I've got a magazine, a machine gun
I'm going to get you, I know I got one
Boom
In the backseat
Where I'm going to meet it
And beat it
And greet it
Unseated
I don't ever want to be a fucking peanut
I may be the cleanest, meet me in the Zenith
I'll never ever let nothing come between us
Hurricane hunger, check out the thunder
GIRL
(Shit)
We ain't getting any younger
Go read it, don't treat it like a Phoenix
Burn where the baby goes, tell me about them other boys
Do they love you like a Playboy? Or a Gameboy?
Here's my crescendo, put away Nintendo
We don't need no curtains on the window
Let me see your banks, let me see your books
Let me see your legs, let me see your hooks
Sing an opera, candelabra
Imma get a condom, put it on my monster
Wanna see my light show?
I can tell you want to go
Boom

Imma kiss you like a bubble in the brooks [x4]

// Rhythm Of Devotion //

[Serengeti:]
I don't care if you've been to Japan
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I be right-right where you step
I put them peas on your plate
I put that drill in your drain
I put that shit in your thing
I put my head on your shoe
You put your hand on my back
I put your hand on my side
I feel more comfortable now [x3]
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Detroit
I be right-right where you stand [x6]
I be right-right-right-right-right-right where you stand
I don't care if you've been to LA
I don't care if you've been to Detroit
I don't care if you've been to Tibet
I be right-right where you step
I'll be that I and you're J [x2]
I don't give no fuck where you at
I don't give no fuck
I don't give no shit [x5]
I feel more comfortable now [x4]

[Sufjan:]
This is how I want to love you
With an open heart
And an open hand
This is how I want to touch you
With an open heart
And an open hand
Nothing else will come between us
But an open heart
And an open hand
I don't care if you feel ugly
I've got an open heart
I wanna be your man
I can feel the rhythm of your heart

[Hook - Sufjan (Serengeti):]
Can you feel the rhythm of devotion?
(I be right-right where you step
I be right-right where you step
I'll be right back) [x3]
Can you feel the rhythm of devotion?
(I got your back)
I can feel the rhythm of your heart

[Sufjan (Robot):]
I can feel your heartbeat strongly
(I can feel the rhythm)
Under your open shirt
(I can feel the rhythm)
With the back of my hand
(I can feel the rhythm of your heart)
It's the feeling of devotion
(I can feel the rhythm)
Let me look at what it's worth
(I can feel the rhythm)
I wanna be your man
(I can feel the rhythm of your heart)
This
Is how I want to touch you
With an open heart
And an open hand
I don't care if you feel ugly
I've got an open heart
I wanna be your man

[Hook x2]

[Sufjan:]
(I can feel the rhythm of your heart)
De-
Vo-
Tion [x4]

[Serengeti:]
I feel more comfortable now [x17]
[Sufjan:]
Open heart
[Serengeti:]
Yeah

// Flying Ace //

[Serengeti:]
Desert wizard, lizard, and dragon tussle
Whole forest burned down and ruined the town's truffles
Except for the outer realm mountains, everything else is brown
And hundreds of hounds pillage the village, can't fuck with the sounds

Crew back giant-ass, large, looking slick as the barge
Old-ass mustache cars, we ran those bars

We felt like superstars, we had the cubes too
She had great tubes, pretty feet and shoes
Porn and your mom's lube, Hold on to the right new
Might have the hissy fit, and tear the whole room apart, to bits

Speech about privacy, why you gotta lie to me?
I don't know where I left off, she had the plaid top
"You're about to black out, you need to get out"
"We too tall to fit in this small house"
Neck all stressed down, hanging-ass red face
That or the dog case, more like a comfortable couch
Step over the mess gate, into the real house

Hair on my new wool, looking like cashmere
Looking like crow too, magical star shapes
Sticky like model cap, feathery silk capes
Venomous black crepes, venomous glass snakes
Delicate wine flute, help us commiserate
Florida date state, they had the best bass
Gladly make you a steak, even dig you a lake
This is your stereo, it'll keep you awake
You're about to black out

Back and forth catechism, cattle and ammunition
Queen didn't have vision, didn't he —shit— mention
Dragons were coming soon
Should've made harpoons, instead of ornate brooms
Bought the museum safe, look where we at now
Pillage the village hounds, benzos gone man
We're about to black out, stepping into a room
Popcorn-sealed fume, expensive like [?]
Giant-ass mouth clothes, arrogant all pose
Soak-in-the-soap clothes, standing in old clothes
Giant-ass mountain ship, cut to the cockpit
Focus and close mouth, we're about to black out

We are too tall, to fit in a dog house
What a melodic thing
Taller than Seth Green, shorter than Sid Bream
Entirely in a dream, we are Hall & Oates
Avis' car quotes, saddened and bounded
Why weren't we grounded?
I was at Wimbledon, close to Ontario
Emotional feelings hurt, pissy-pants first grade
Smell like your cousin's age, back before Sissy Rage
Little man, long legs
Samsara horse escape, spiderwebs on clothes
Walking with brown face, look at the new apes
We're about to smash graves

// My Oh My //

[Serengeti:]
Can you resist the urge of going on a shopping splurge?
Coming home with hats and a kit to make curd
This is how you curdle the shot like Steve Urkel
There's books by Studs Terkel and pet store gerbils
"This place used to buy and sell turtles"
T-shirt girdle tight, look good to feel right
Feel bad? Blame life, peace Steve Ryan light
You're the light, you're the light, you're the light

[Hook - Sufjan:]
My oh my oh my oh my

Yo enough about me though, you got a favorite game show?
Mine is called "I'm involved"
But nothing that the Manic Pixie Dream Girl can't solve
Nothing that's organic is impossible to dissolve
[?] uplifts millions
Go back to school and expand on your brilliance
You can spring back and say shit, I'm resilient
I'm crocodillian, catch me underwater
By the water buffalo and feed the alligator daughter
Yeah, great father, face hairy like Chewbacca
Taught the Dim Mak form from Senzo Tanaka
Don't use Binoca or chew gum either
Drink a lot of milk like my name was Ted Cleaver
Innocent America, dreams do change on Kane like Erica
Into Pine Valley before I jumped onto Caprica
Me and the wife and the kids up in the Acura
Happy as a bug in a rug, a clam in a dog
A pig in a log, a frog in a shark
Happy as the freedom of Yosemite National Park [?]
Ping-pong, Ding-dong rules of rap

[Hook]

[Serengeti:]
Give it more than you can take
Give it more than you can take
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's-

[Serengeti:]
Do you have a favorite game show?
I like Jeopardy, I like Wheel of Fortune
I like Facts of Life
Let's Make a Deal, Let's Make a Deal
S' and S' and S' and S'
S' and S' and S' and S'
Show me your S', don't care what your sex is
S' and S' and S' and S'
Show me your S', don't care what your sex is
(Let's dance, let's dance)
S' confesses the message is blessing
Show me your S' don't care what your sex is
S' and S' and S' and S'
S' confesses the message is blessing

// I Won't Be Afraid //

[Sufjan:]
I will give it up
I won't be afraid
I won't try too hard
I will touch your back

I'm prepared for death
I will tear my clothes
People try too hard
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?
I will lift my hands
I'm prepared for death
I will tear my clothes
People try too hard
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?
I will lift my hands
I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to?

I won't try too hard
I will touch your back
I'm prepared for death
I won't be afraid

I will give it up
I won't make a mess
I won't try too hard
I won't be afraid

I won't be afraid (I won't be afraid) [x8]

// Lion's Share //

[Serengeti:]
This
Right
Here
Is the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the ropes, down they went
And all they found were sheets in the wind
(Aw, they were blowing)
On the 20th floor, smack downtown
They changed their clothes from white to brown
Caught a cab, and headed south
Way out to Conley's grandma's house
The trail was hot
"You can't stay," Granny turned them both away
They split up, separate ways
Been on the lam about 10 days
They busted out, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share

[Hook - Serengeti (Sufjan):]
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Give me the lion's share) [x6]

This
Right
Here
Is the the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the sheets, smack downtown
Jails can't hold these fellas down
Banks had the loot stashed in the safe
In a backyard in the Buckeye State
He picked and picked
Moon lights the air
Work that back for the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
Work that back for the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
They both got lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share

[Hook]

Work that back for the lion's share [x7]
Get the loot, call for Conley
Lovers live in this economy
Let's all get lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share

[Hook - Serengeti (Sufjan):]
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
(Dance, dance)
With the booty in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Give me the lion's share) [x6]

// Dishes In The Sink //

[Serengeti:]
Dishes in the sink, roaches in the walls
Ain't around my son, so I bought the boy a ball
That'll do, that'll do, that'll do
Set shit off like Jimmy Lennon too
Set shit off like "Hey, I'm leaving you."
We don't have no portions to divvie up in two
Amoeba like, tiger pelt to a wooden knife
An addendum to the lonely rhythm of private life
Dinner for one, dinner in the winterdom
Used to smoke Phillies by Beck's and have fun
Wild boy city had me feeling like a crumb
Feeling depressed like spilling juice on your prom dress
I was happy once when I went to a real brunch
It was special, like "People, don't speak."
Mommy did dope only during the first 30 weeks
Happy family, happy baskets of candy
Family trips to SeaWorld, stolen mother's sea pearls
I ain't seen them, ain't been doing nothing but reading
Walking tall, staying focused, and dreaming
Cleaning up weekends

[Sufjan:]
It was my choice
And the life that I create
I'm nothing to you
I'm nothing to you
And I may look just like a baby
And I may feel just like a dog
I may not look just like I'm fading
I may not look just like I'm fading
And I am hardly hanging on

Dishes in the sink, roaches in the hall
Ain't around my son, so I bought the boy a ball
Cleaning up, weekends
Sleeping off, reasons
Take pictures, send postcards, scrolls
Little smiley faces after massage ropes
Saw my boy, said hello, gave him a new toy
Ask him what his favorite color, mommy gave him a brother
That's beautiful
Family trips to Tampa, tanktops, jean shorts, blue bandana
Black shoes, white socks, no Humana
Draw a portrait, this is real life, stand up
Laugh, this is hilarious, next month I'll meet a life-changing Aquarius
Thank god, I thought about her dad, used to drink wine and feel like king
I'm open, the most open in the ocean
Tiny jellyfish enjoying solitude, floating
I like it, I like it like I like your high kick
I didn't see it coming, the crib needs new plumbing
I'll do it, chip at it, you know I work nights
Six months later, we could pass some bloody street fights
Life's ill, fatigued and broken into a total turnaround
Fast as the speed of sound, or as fast as when the fair moved out of town
Yay, what a great ass day
Overcast, chilly, mist, and really gray
Bought a "A", shoulda bought a "I"
[too quiet to hear clearly]

// Hardly Hanging On //

[Sufjan:]
Yeah I'm still alone
Breathing on the floor
And I look just like a baby
And I feel just like a dog
It was my choice
It was my first thought
You can read it in my waiver
You can hear it in my prayer
You can feel it in my soul
It was my choice
The life that I create
I am nothing to you
I am nothing to you
And I may look just like a baby
And I may feel just like a dog
It may not look just like I'm fading
It may not look just like I'm fading

[Hook x3:]
But I am hardly hanging on [x4]
It was my choice [x6]
But I am hardly hanging on

Dead in the head

With his teeth all a ready
To bled me in pleasure

Yeah he sucked out my soul with the Devil's integrity

I am a witness
Acrylic an institute
Fuck me I'm heavy
I'm fucking incredible
Mess with my lesson
Devotion my heaven in question is heavy
And mental addiction adventure
I'm down on the floor and the rug is a mess
I'm a crab with a kiss and a squid on my chest
I can feel you beside me
I feel you around me
Equation is algebra
Lesson
Confession
I need you, be near me
I kill you, endear me
I kiss you
I catch you
I kid you
I want your protection
I jump like a tango
A kangaroo
Monogamy song is a mess
My address
I'm all sweaty
I need you beside me like Sisyphus
Down on me, holdin' me
Thrown like a knife
He's found in the stone
But I know he's a killer
The weight of the pillar
My theories a thriller
My stories are filler
I feel like venom
I'll bite you despite you
I wanted to like you
But I'll suck out your soul with the Devil's integrity
I'll suck at your dick with the Devil's integrity

[Sufjan:]
I am not my father
I am not my father
I am not my father
I am not my father
