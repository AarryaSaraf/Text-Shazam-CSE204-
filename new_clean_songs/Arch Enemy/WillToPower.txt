// The Race //

I heard there was a place where we're all one race
Color, gender, age never could dictate
I saw there was a time when we valued all life
Nobody oppressed, everyone had rights
Suddenly
In an age where the distance between us is binary
All we see
Is an internal war, friendly fire in the sky and respect on the floor

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
Of caustic defeat, now there's no turning back

Ha! So we laugh while the tides all turn
Maiting grey matter, voluntarily slaves
Always searching for the one real truth
So we can misconstrue it to suit our needs

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
Of caustic defeat, now there's no turning back

Ingesting, operant conditioning
Divine contamination, like lye on flesh - it stings
Trust your leaders, trust the system, reproduce, repeat
Never question authority, never suspect deceit

Always on the run
Can't remember where we're running to
Or what we're running from but we're picking up speed
All the books and broadcast? Jettison!
Without their burden true ethics are freed
Extract the labels that lobotomize
And you'll realize we are all one
Fly or swim, fur or skin
We're alive! Abolitionists rise!

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
Of caustic defeat, now don't go turning back

// Blood In The Water //

There's blood in the water
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared

Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust while bombs never rust
Watch the war on your screen
Yesterday's ideals were just a dream

There's blood in the water

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

There's profit in prophets
Too much money in lies
Missiles fueled by hatred
As the blind lead the blind

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

Equality, now a profanity
Wave goodbye to humanity
There's a monster under your bed
You created it so don't be scared

Round and round we go
Where this will end nobody knows

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Have we finally run out of road?
You can't build a wall high enough
Can't dig a deep enough hole

There's blood in the water
There's fear in the air
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
And we're all running scared

There's blood in the water
Eye for an eye
There's blood in the water
There's blood in the water
Eye for an eye

// The World Is Yours //

Rise into the light and fade to the night
Sick of being told how to run your life
Their rules, their schools
Empty words they promise so much
The present status quo remains untouched

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

Every empire was raised by the slave
Built through the ages you can destroy it in a day
Turn the page, unleash your rage
Burn your golden cage and walk away
On your path toward ultimate power

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

Straining at the leash
Foaming at the mouth
No more subservience
Justice will be done

There was only so much
You could take
There was only so much
You could tolerate
When the bough breaks
The empire will fall

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

// The Eagle Flies Alone //

When I was born the seed was sown
I will not obey, my life is my own
Battle those who wish to enslave me
Expose the lies that enrage me

I don't believe in heaven, I don't believe in hell
Never joined the herd, could not adjust well
Slave and master, it's not for me
I chose my own path, set myself free

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone

Reject the system that dictates the norm
This world is full of lies and deceit
I have felt betrayal, cut so deep
Suffered defeat only to rise again

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone

Alone!

I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
I, I go my own way
I swim against the stream
Forever I will fight the powers that be
The eagle flies alone

// Reason To Believe //

There's a scar on your heart
But your journey's just begun
A distant light that's worth the fight
The story's far from done
Stop hurting yourself
Those tired sores have nothing more to bleed
Hey!

Self hatred I know it well
It's dragging you down
Listen to me now

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

They don't understand you
And they hate what they don't understand
You are more than they'll ever know
Like sand through your fingers
Don't let your life slip away
This prison of glass can't hold you back no more

Self hatred I know it well
It's dragging you down
Listen to me now

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Listen to me...
Always keep on fighting my friend

// Murder Scene //

Turning a blind eye
Won't make the world disappear
The second sight returns
So, too, does the pain and fear

I'll refuse to acknowledge
I'll refuse to accept
Reality force-feeding me anguish and regret

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence forever will be exposure therapy

There stand strangers where the world used to be
Can't take change or are retinas still not letting me see?

I'll refuse to acknowledge
I'll refuse to accept
Reality force-feeding me anguish and regret

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence forever will be exposure therapy

No "we", no "us"
Two halves un-whole
I'm your sisyphus
You laugh every roll

And you will suffer
And you will drown
You are the victor? How heavy's the crown?

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence will forever be dead to me

// First Day In Hell //

Torn from home, sent down death's railroad, are we
When we wake up tomorrow
Will we still be wearing this curse?
Will we wake up tomorrow?
Which punishment is worse?

Day one: no sun
Stripped of our names
Now we are merely numbers
Permanently inked in the flames

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

Innocent men, women, children
Sentenced before conviction
With golden stars to guide them
Their gavel is the end of a gun

Day two: lived through
More culprits arrive
Every cage so crowded
How will we survive through the night?

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

First day in hell

First day in hell
See the terror in abandoned gazes...
Fear sunken eyes
Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine

Incarcerated without reason
Doomend by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation
Our birth right

Week five: alive
Soon out of time
After all that I've, here, witnessed
There's no value in life

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

First day in hell
First week in hell
See the terror in abandoned gazes...
Fear sunken eyes
Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine

First month in hell
Incarcerated without reason
Doomend by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation
Our birth right

Last day in hell

// Dreams Of Retribution //

Screams echo through the halls
Fingernails dragging down the walls
Broken down, betrayed, abandoned
Never thought you'd see my face again?

Behind barred windows I watch the sky
Not an hour goes by without asking why

Broken down, betrayed, abandoned
Never thought you'd see my face again?
Well, did you?

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me! I'm not insane!
Leave me be! Set me free!

In a place so dark that demons fear
I'm rotting away, year after year
You're on the outside, you're laughing at me
One day, you'll pay, you will see

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me! I'm not insane!
Leave me be! Set me free!

You made them believe
In the lies that you weave
Now everyone's an enemy
Who to believe?

They shut off the lights
Another sleepless night awaits
Dreams of retribution keep me awake
My vengence will be glorious, victorious

Plotting my revenge is the only thing keeping me alive
Then they administer the medicine
Straight to my heart

Listen to me! I'm not insane!
Leave me be! Set me free!

You will see!

// My Shadow And I //

You bathe in sorrow, drowning in hate
You kill tomorrow, fighting against the fates
Raise hell - wipe that smile off your face
Raise hell - fall into place

Pick up your entrails the time has come
Leave the bed of nails, let it all burn
Raise hell - wipe that smile off your face
Raise hell - embrace hell

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the way through

Your face disgusts me, turn it away
You think you know at whom you're staring?
Raise hell - I'll scrape that smile off your face
Raise hell - The end of all days

What is this defense you're drowning in?
Give up the pretense, it's sink or swim
Raise hell - I'll scrape that smile off your face
Raise hell - The end of all days

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the way through

Right behind me matching every stride
Though you're made of darkness
You only appear in the light

You made your bed, now lay

Why die in peace while living in fear?
Didn't you know your heaven was insincere
Raise hell - unite the fire and sky
Raise hell - and bury the lie

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the right way to go

// A Fight I Must Win //

I've lived in darkness
Stood in the light
Crawled through the shadows
Between wrong and right

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win

With wings of tin and feet of stone
I crash against the ground below
It's not the first time
Won't be the last time
Got to pick myself up - get on with the show

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win
I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

I'm not like I was before
I'm something less, I'm something more
This life has been bitter sweet
Blackened heart stays on the beat

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win
I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

Alone in my cloak of lead
Choking on words of advice
Heard all the answers - most of them lies

I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One last fight I must win
There's a demon dwelling within

This is a fight I must win
A fight I must win
This is a fight I must win
A fight I must win
This is a fight I must win
A fight I must win
This is a fight I must win
A fight I must win
