// Space Cadet //

I'm a space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet always higher
Space cadet always flying
Space cadet without even trying

Where I come from you never grow old
There's no crying, we walk on streets of gold
It's a different world with lots of love
Of to visit space above

I'm a space cadet getting higher
Space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet always trying
Space cadet always flying

Space cadet getting higher
Space cadet, I'm a moonlight rider
Space cadet, light my fire
Space cadet, I'll go flying

Don't be afraid when we fly
You'll feel peace deep inside
When you try it I'm sure you'll like it
Come on, baby, why don't you try it?

Space cadet getting higher
Space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet moving higher
Space cadet always flying

Space cadet, space cadet
I'm a space cadet, space cadet
I'm a space cadet, different worlds
Space cadet, lots of lonely girls

Space cadet always trying
Space cadet always flying
Space cadet, I'm a space cadet
Space cadet, I'm a space cadet

// Red Light //

She's nasty
Aha, hey eh yeah

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Show me, all about your love
Take me, take me in your heart
Baby, never let me go
Teach me, teach me what you know

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Baby, that's the way we do it
Take me, never let me go
Shake it, shake it down to the floor
I love it, baby do it some more

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Red light, red light
Tonight, red light

Oh, there's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got, you've got love for me tonight

It's a red light, it's a bright red light
And it shows me, you've got love for me tonight
It's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise

Red light, tonight
Red light, tonight
Oh red light, tonight
It's alright
Red light, burning bright
Red light

Oh, there's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got, you've got love for me tonight

Tonight, tonight
I see red light
Says you've got love, for me tonight
Says you've got love

// I Ask Myself //

I wanna know, do you want me?
I wanna know, am I all you need?
Sometimes I feel I get no respect
And when you give love is fifty percent

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I've saw in love, where is my mind?
I wouldn't wonder from time to time
I feel that I had something to live for
But you make me feel like I
I can't be sure, now...

I ask myself if you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

Friends I can to can all for the answer
They only confuse me and lead me nowhere
You are the key in needing to unlock me
To bring out the best love inside me now

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I got to know (I ask myself)

Come on and bring out your love inside too
That's all I need now for you to do
Love me or leave me
Let me be lonely
I'll give all, you gotta in love me only now

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
Got to know (I ask myself)
I got to know (I ask myself)

I ask myself (I ask myself)
Oh babe (I ask myself)
I wanna know (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)

Uh now I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
(I ask myself, I ask myself)
(I ask myself)

// You Keep Me Hanging On //

Set me free, why don't you, babe?
Get out of my life, why don't you, babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life?
Let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, hey

Set me free, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Let me be, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothing I can do about it

Set me free, why don't you, babe? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Get out of my life, why don't you, babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

You claim you still count on me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
Now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
Don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else, hey

Why don't you be a woman about it
And set me free?
Now, you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night, please
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Go on, get out, get out of my life
Let me sleep at night, oh (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on, oh (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on, ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You don't really need me
You just keep me hangin' on

// Make Me A Star //

Make me a star

Make me a star
I want to appear before
Thousands of people
In a crowd

Make me a star
I want to sing my songs
To help the people
Laugh and smile

I pray my dream comes true
I wanna be just like you
I've seen the things you do
Make me a star

Make me a star
Like Willman sings
Beauty queens
Everything I need

Make me a star
Shining lights
Party nights and
Golden rings

And wouldn't you love me, girl
If I were a star
I wouldn't break your heart
If I was there when you want

Make me a star

Make me star
Would that change the way you feel about me
Make me a star
Or am I standing here with everything you ever need

Make me a star
Make me a star
Make me a star
Make me a star

// I Don't Wanna Make Love //

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
I don't want no hot conversation
I got to feel the real love in me
You're never gonna make a fool out of me

Ha ha ha
You try to break my heart
You tease me to the limit
And leave me in the dark
Who who who
Who do you think you are?
You don't go all the way
You only go so far

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
Heard about your bad reputation
You're a teaser, but I won't play
If you wanna break a heart, stay away

The way you move your body
Fire in your eyes
But I don't need nobody
Trying to tell me li-i-i-i-i-ies, oh

Oh oh oh oh
No no no

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
I don't need no false invitation
I gotta feel the real love in me
Oh, you're never gonna make a fool out of me

Oh, no no, I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
No, no, I don't wanna make a fool out of me

Ha ha ha
Here we are
You didn't get what you were after
I'm the one who laughs, ha ha ha

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe (no, no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (don't wanna)
Heard about your bad reputation (yeah)
You're a teaser and I won't play, oh, no no

I don't wanna make love if you don't (oh, no no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (no, no no no)
I don't wanna make, I don't wanna make love, baby, no no (don't wanna make love)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (oh, na na na)

I don't wanna make love if you don't (oh, no no no no no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (no, baby)
(I don't wanna make if you don't)
Not gonna, not gonna do to me
(I don't wanna make a fool out of me)
You're not gonna make a fool out of me...

// Holdin' On So Long //

Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Holding on

Holding back and holding on
And holding in my love
Taking time to move you deep inside
Moving slow, steady goes
Your body and your mind
When we go, I won't leave you behind
Spread your wings, tonight we're gonna fly

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let you go
Holding on so long
I'm about to explode
Holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Once again, starting is
Second time around
Keep it up, please don't make a sound
Hold on tight, you're gonna leave the ground

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let go
Holding on so long
I'm about to explode
Holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long
Holding on

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let go
I've been holding on so long
I'm about to explode
I've been holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Holding, holding on so long
I've gotta let go
Oh, I've been holding on too long
