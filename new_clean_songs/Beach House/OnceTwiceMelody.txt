Album: OnceTwiceMelody

// Once Twice Melody //

Out in the summer sun
She was the only one
Days go by
In her eyes
Belle de jour in front of me
No matter where you go
There'll always be your shadow

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

The purple on the vine
The velvet deep tree line
Nights fly by
In her mind
All along the boulevard
She tries to understand
A never, never land

(La-la-la) Across the room
(La-la-la) Sweet perfume
The sun, the moon, the raindrops too

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

Once, twice, Melody

// Superstar //

There's a light going out tonight
Driving fast
Flashing lines
It's too late now to say goodbye
The stars were there
In our eyes

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
Backlit up against the wall
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun

Somewhere out on the radio
Look up high
Now you're gone
I see it now in this photograph
Something good
Never meant to last
I don't wanna know how the story ends
From now to then

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun
Backlit up against the wall

Superstar, shining far

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun
Backlit up against the wall

Superstar, shining far

When you were mine
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Backlit up against the wall
Superstar, shining far

// Pink Funeral //

How sweet (How sweet)
The sound (The sound)
The swell of strings begins to rise
The stage (The stage)
Is set (Is set)
The painted stars, they fill our eyes
This heart of mine
Goes out of time
Blue skies turn black
Behind our back

Don't let me go
Once was a fairy tale
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break
Tears through a white lace veil
Pink funeral

Somewhere underneath the boughs
You'll get away, get away somehow
Far from here
All around (All around)
The lake of tears (The lake of tears)
You'll know she's near (You'll know she's near)

Don't let me go
Once was a fairy tale
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break
Tears through a white lace veil
Pink funeral

Somewhere underneath the boughs
You'll get away, get away somehow
Far from here
All around (All around)
The lake of tears (The lake of tears)
You'll know she's near (You'll know she's near)

Don't let me go (Blue skies turned black)
Once was a fairy tale (Behind our back)
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break (This heart of mine)
Tears through a white lace veil (Goes out of time)
Pink funeral

// Through Me //

Something reminds me
Sweet dreams inside me
Limits shifting
Colors living through me
Just like days are ending
Just like we're pretending
At the window, let the light go
Through me

And in each silhouette
A time before the time we met
(A time before the time we met)
Here lies Violet who can't forget what happens next
(In time, you'll see, you'll see through me)

Do you recognize it?
Did you try to hide it?
All the lifetimes
Sweeping right by through you

And in each silhouette
A time before the time we met
(A time before the time we met)
Here lies Violet who can't forget what happens next
(In time, you'll see, you'll see through me)

Through you
Through me
Through you
Through me

// Runaway //

My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
My little runaway

The night has just begun
Can you cover what you're hiding from?
Something beautiful and dangerous
What we keep close to us

My little runaway
I wonder where you are
Will you be back someday?
My little runaway

I wonder where you are
Are you sliding down the tops of cars?
Your hair melting into silver stars
May you never go too far

My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
You need to runaway
My little runaway
I wonder where you are
Will you be back someday?
My little runaway

// ESP //

What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

You caught me looking over
Tears were in your eyes
What cuts you, makes you bolder
Could you read my mind?

What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

Look around, little one
All this writing on the wall
You know it comes
When you start to fall

What makes someone a stranger?
Is it someplace you won't go?
Somewhere you could get faded
Someway to keep you close

What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

Here you are, damage done
Pointless aiming in the dark
You will know when it comes
Stick around, little one
All the writings on the wall
You know it comes
When you start to fall

// New Romance //

Days go by, no reply
The smoke high on the avenue
You and I know that
You're not gonna leave it anyway
Pick me up, I know you're close
The headlights running down the wall

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
I-L-Y-S-F-M

Take my chances, new romances
Eyes roll on the avenue
Left on red, daylight moving backwards
'Cause you're off again
Can you fly higher than a hawk
Flies in a black star sky?

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
I-L-Y-S-F-M

Block after block
With the speakers on
Night after night
We say our goodbyes

My love drips in red out of my mind at the edge of the sky
You feel your heart break and you don't know why
You're somebody else, somebody new
"Fuck it", you said, "it's beginning to look like the end"
So sick of swimming, I'm in over my head
No wrong or right, I know it's true

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up

// Over And Over //

When the lights go down and divide the day
Out of nothing comes the moonglow
And all that is left (and all that is left) around you
When all the lights go down

One by one, they open, forever and ever
All the little angels descend

A flicker in the sky reflects the dying light
Wherever you may go, a halo
And all that is lit (and all that is lit) surrounds you
As all the lights go down

One by one, they open, forever and ever
All the little angels descend

Lilac, lily, anemone in poses
Soft, frail and blue, the violets too, and roses

All the little angels, forever and ever
One by one, they open, over and over again

And so, these days, go (over and over)
To each, that follows
The night, that has no end (over and over)
Will be the last, my friend
And so, these days, go (over and over)
To each, that follows
The night, that has no end (over and over)
Will be the last, my friend

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

// Sunset //

Lay me where the flowers grow
(Lay me where the flowers grow)
For the palace is descending
(For the palace is descending)
Golden fans across the land now
(Golden fans across the land now)

Just one key ties everything

Blackbird red, the wings that spread, winds that turn, a pretty word
Bird of prey, the clothing lay, on the line, and out to dry
Broken fence and two arms length, spidersilk, and sweet nonsense

Just one key ties everything

Sugar on her eyelids, cosmos for the veil

For the palace is descending
(For the palace is descending)
The country where she's going, someday we all shall find
Lay me where the flowers growing
(Lay me where the flowers growing)
Choose the one to follow, take them in your arms
Golden fans across the land now
(Golden fans across the land now)
Golden fans across the land now

Just one key ties everything

// Only You Know //

Don't blink...

I saw you standing there
With the sunshine in your hair
You come to my window
You tell me you're high
Where do all the friends go when the fantasies die?
Only you know

Don't blink...

You were sweet like a candy cane
I didn't even know your name
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me you're gone
But you always stay until you hear your song
I go along

In the summer blaze
Under melting days
All tomorrow's skies
Feel it every time
On my way to you
On my way to you

Don't blink...

And while those days are gone
Do you know you were the only one?
Every disaster comes faster and faster
And everyone says it was fun while it lasted
It went right past us

In the summer blaze
Under melting days
All tomorrow's skies
Feel it every time
(You tell me you're leaving, you tell me you're gone)
On my way to you
(But you always stay until you hear your song)
(I go along)
On my way to you (You come to my window, you tell me you're high)
(Where do all the friends go when the fantasies die?)
On my way to you
(Only you know, only you know)

// Another Go Around //

Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right here
Another boy in town and his smile tells you nowhere
Another boy in town and he's right there
Another go tonight and the drugs were just right
But the one you need isn't there
Another circumstance where you're wringing your hands
Because the girl you know disappears
Another boy in town and his smile tells you nowhere
Another toy in town and he's right there

Because the game that you play seems to get in the way
And the one you need isn't there
Another circumstance where you're wringing your hands
Because the girl you know disappears
Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right there
Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right there

// Masquerade //

She comes dressed like Sunday
String of pearls around her neck
Room of mirrors, days of lace
Porcelain and picturesque

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black

Roses on the winding path
Velvet ribbon down her back
Shadows lie across her face
Drowning in a state of grace

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black
They'll come at night, to take her back

Want to need you
Need to please you
Do you see her in the mirror?
In the mirror, do you see her?
Want to need you
Need to please you

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black
They'll come at night, to take her back

Light each candle, here tonight then gone forever
Light each candle, here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever

// Illusion Of Forever //

Diamonds down her back
Sunshine in her lap
Centuries of light
Rubies in her hair
Moonlight in her stare
Centuries of light
Diamonds down her back

Sunday song, the way home is long
Sailing to the stars, I wonder why it's so hard?

Always, always
Centuries of light
And I can't believe in nothing just yet
(Always, always, always)
Can't believe in nothing just yet

Diamonds down her back
Baby girl, I know you so well
And I'll always be right here

Rubies in her hair
So we go
To someplace none can know
Sailing to the stars, I wonder why it's so hard?

Always always
Centuries of light
And I can't believe in nothing just yet
(Always, always, always)
Can't believe in nothing just yet

Diamonds down her back
In this world, I know you so well
And I'll always be right here
(Always, always, always)
And I can't believe in nothing just yet

// Finale //

Roller skating in the parking lot
I don't care 'case I like it vacant
Do you know what your heart is for?
In case you did forget it

Red sunglasses and a lollipop
See her dressed in the polka dot
Came around in the alley smoke
Confetti on the floor

Is it over? Yeah it's over
The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Favorite movie on the TV screen
Black sequins disappearing
Another story about a beauty queen
Wore my dress then I ripped against it

Is it over? Yeah it's over
The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Memory likes to talk a lot
I don't care because I know I'll forget it
When I put my fingers up
All the sparkles wouldn't let it

The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

// The Bells //

I can't live without you, I'll be the last one at the bar
There's just something about you, when I look out at the stars
There's a road between us, nothing too profound
And that is what took us, not the other way around

The way that blue, she cuts right through
And so the stars are breaking hearts
Like the bells, they ring out all the same

Something somebody told me, think the plane is going down
You can't take it with you, so let me buy you the next round
Whenever you were driving, I'd put my feet up on the dash
I'd imagine stories about everywhere we'd pass

The cars, the bars, the lies, the girls on Mars, the superstars
Are like the bells, they ring out all the same

And maybe one day, you'll hear them singing
You'll step outside, and they'll be ringing

The cars, the bars, the lies, the girls on Mars, the superstars
Are like the bells, they ring out all the same

// Hurts To Love //

Lookin' out at the wide wild world
It's a lot for the boys and girls
There's a lot of bad things out there
When they nod and they just don't care
You've got imagination

If it hurts to love
Better do it anyway

A friend of mine is a friend of yours
It's a gift but it's always a curse
To go on without it
You carve it out of a bad bad heart
It's the thing that tears you apart
It's got to come from something

If it hurts to love you
Should I walk away?

If it hurts to love
You better do it anyway
If it hurts too much
Well I loved you anyway

Lookin' out at the wide wild world
It's a lot for the boys and girls
You carve it out of a bad bad heart
It's the thing that tears us apart

If it hurts to love
You better do it anyway

// Many Nights //

Many nights
Spent our light
To a side
Do you recognize?
Many others
Little flowers
Many nights
By your side
Listening high
To suicide

With the stars above you
Do you really want to?

We're on this ride
Two to a side
Do I recognize?
In your eyes

With the stars above you
Do you really want to?

Many nights
Like any other night
I saw
And you know

Play it last
Play it low
Let it ride
Let it go
Slow you rock
Slow you roll

Many nights
Many nights
Many nights

// Modern Love Stories //

Cleopatra's portrait, in the bathroom line
All the parties ended with a lust for life
A dark mouth surrounds us, into the stardust

I stand before the ending, carousel ascending
The end is the beginning, beginning to an ending
Like the cells dividing, zeroes multiplying

You tell me it existed, as you lie beside me
From the early wars, to modern love stories
I reach into the darkness, the universe collects us
