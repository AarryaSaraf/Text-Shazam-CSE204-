// Saltwater //

Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Dream I'm in the saltwater

Timing's gone all bad
Broken faith and a broken way
You couldn't lose me if you tried
'Cos I'll be rollin' to your side, baby

Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Broken faith and a broken way

You couldn't lose me if you tried

// Tokyo Witch //

in a dark winter Tokyo
in the Mahjong parlour he waits
severed past throbbing through his hands
nobody comes to the one who waits
in the hallways they're lying there in the red blossom of the gaze
in your arms there is nothing left
we are all on the wait

my whole life is a mystery that i can't break
our lings and Calvary of our mistakes
i would love to heal you now

in a dark winter tokyo
in the Mahjong parlours they wait
severed past sweeping through their hands
nobody comes to the ones that wait

in the heart of the young they gloss over the pain

all i wanted to see is that i am better
all i want to believe is that i am better
round and round
all i want you to see is that i am better
round and round

// Apple Orchard //

1, 2, 3, 4

You only give me
what you don't want no more
ask the questions
that you don't know at all

let's lie down for awhile
you can smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

you know how it is my friend
in the boxes of those picture frames
hold your inside 'cause you're cold at night
warm your heart, love, 'cause you're by my side

let's lie down for awhile
you can smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

lay your hand on me
apple orchard
take your time
you can settle down
hold your breath
'cause you're, you are nothing
hold your hand on me
for a while

// Master Of None //

You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I will not beg you please

I want your picture but not your words
You know they want it, but there's no first
On your own
But you can not call it your all

We always wrung our heads too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your unknown

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy, but devil's plan
On your own
You can not call me your all

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun

You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
But you can not; you will not agree

// Auburn And Ivory //

Once when I saw her there
White light she stood so still
Warming her eyes to the sea
Hardly her way to be free

Auburn and ivory
Heart break and pony tails

Holding her bones by a fire
writing the letter she sails
white page turns golder lights
wanting her one sacrifice

auburn and ivory
heart break and pony tails

come to me
and I'll tell you what's wrong
she said, "I'll wait for you. I'll wait for..."

Once when I saw her there
white light she stood so still
white page turns golder lights
hardly her one sacrifice

auburn and ivory
heart break and pony tails

// Childhood //

The beginning of the end,
Of the heart lost, was my friend.
The nature of that place,
Sends a sweet smell,
Around my head.
Oh well.

The hardest thing of all,
The heartbreak of our loss.
Hiding all the time.
We were cast out, of everywhere,
But not the last time;
The last time I remember, the last time I remember,
It was gone.

How I want you to know,
How far west we will go.
Hand in hand they're in love,
All loyal days end slowly.

All my toys are dead-
Unravelled at the stairs.
Open but who cares.
Why-h-hy-hy?

// Lovelier Girl //

Long days of wanting you here
living in fear
shedding a tear for you

Long nights of pasty face tunes
echo in rooms
filling with gloom for me

Letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea

Now I step into the line
girl on the
in all the world than you

There's nothing lovelier, girl
in all the world than making love to you

Letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea

Lately got to thinking that
how I long to have you here with me

// House On The Hill //

you'd do anything
just to reach our door
but I won't be there

how does it feel
the house on the hill

you'd give anyone
just to reach our door

and i won't be there.

// Heart And Lungs //

1, 2, 3, 4

From our lives
The land disappears
All that is left is a heart made of tears
From her smile the golden tooth is worn
Child you're only hope has flown
Hold on to this house
All I have left is the only place I've been

It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's hard, hard to run
It's not that much fun
It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's all...

Heart
