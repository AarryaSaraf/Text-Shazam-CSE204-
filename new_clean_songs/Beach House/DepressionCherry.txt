// Levitation //

You and me with our long hair on the gold one
After midnight we could feel it all
I go anywhere you want to

You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
Cause you blow my mind

On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
There is no right time
There is no right time

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get through it

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now

There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you

// Sparks //

We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark

Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark

You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
(Just like a spark)
It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again

Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive

// Space Song //

It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty seat
A flash of light

It would take awhile
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I'm on your side

You wide-eyed girls
You get it right

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart

What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

// Beyond Love //

Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth

Beyond love
I wanted to find ever since I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands

Beyond love
This thing comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
Our nerves would've seen
No change in his
Vision sprung into dreams
Of a world left without it

I really wanna know
I really do breathe
We really do breathe
We really wanna know

The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, net up in the corner with the spiders made of night
We really wanna know
Beyond love
Our nerves would've seen
And I can't live without it
Could you ever believe
Beyond love?

I really wanna know
I really wanna know

// 10:37 //

Chances are like night disappeared
Caught in the atmosphere
Where you go, she casts no shadow
Still you know she's near

Lie
Lie

Here she comes, all parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand
With the dark, thunder above you
Come to a song, we...

Lie
Lie

Chances are
10: 37
House made of the dawn
Disappears

Lie
Lie

// PPP //

Out in the heartland
I looked into your eyes
And I asked
"Are you ready? Ready for this life?"

Did you see it coming
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates oh well
And if this ice
Should break
It would be
My mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
It doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well

Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates so well
And if this ice should break
It would be
My mistake

// Wildflower //

No better color
Look everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side

You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of every light
It turns you on every night

Need a companion
My head in prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours

No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Wildflower

// Bluebird //

Love, it comes up
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling

Even I
Can't control
My nature

If there should come
A match before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you

Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

We flee to
The gallows
Then I
Caught up my eye
There's something

Its boat
Led me back
From nothing
From nothing

If there should come
A match before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you

Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

Things change
Before they are over
Before they are over

// Days Of Candy //

No one could find you
Out on your own
All things I loved
But do not know

Our hope will rule
These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lights
Wide, fenced and wise

Across my eyes
A world inside you
No faltered ground
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind

Just like that, it's gone
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that

I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I hope, I feel, I know
A little bit of you will keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you
