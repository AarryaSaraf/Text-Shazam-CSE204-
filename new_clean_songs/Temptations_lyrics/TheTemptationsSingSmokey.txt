// The Way You Do The Things You Do //

You've got a smile so bright, you know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight, you know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet, you know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet, you know you could have been some perfume

[Chorus:]
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are, you know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute, you know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart, you know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart, you know you could have been a schoolbook

[Chorus]

You made my heart so rich, you know you could have been some money
And baby you're so sweet, you know you could have been some honey

[Chorus]

You really swept me off my feet, you made my life complete
You made my life so bright, you make me feel alright

// Baby, Baby I Need You //

I need you.
Whoa, I need you.
Baby, baby, baby don't you know
That I need you (so), (so), (so), (so)
I want you.
Whoa, I want you.
Baby, baby, baby don't you know
That I want you (so), (so), (so), (so)
[Paul:]
You knew my lips were lonely for, the kisses you could give to me.
Ever since the first day, baby, that we met.
[Eddie:]
So if you say you're mine and let our hearts combine.
I swear I'll never let you forget how much...
I love you.
Whoa, I love you.
Baby, baby, baby don't you know
That I love you (so), (so), (so), (so)
I need you.
Whoa, I want you.
[Paul:] Baby, baby, baby.
[Eddie:] Baby
Whoa, I love you.
[Paul:] Darling, darling
[Eddie:] Oh, darling
Whoa, whoa
Come home, come home, come home, come home.
[Paul:] Can't you see that I need it.
[Eddie:] Bring it home to me, baby.
Come home, come home, come home, come home.

// My Girl //

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooooh

I don't need no money, fortune or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout
My girl
Ooooh
My girl
As long as I can talk about my girl...

// What Love Has Joined Together //

It would be easier to take the wet from water or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us or stop us from holding hands, 'cause...

[Chorus:]
I love you, I love you from the bottom of my heart
And what love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from the snow or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take me love from you 'cause you're my heart's desire, &...

[Chorus]

Even if they separate us 1000 miles apart
We will still be together in each other's hearts
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you; I love you dear

[Chorus]
[title twice, then fade]

// You'll Lose A Precious Love //

One day, you will begin to realize
By the look that's in my eyes

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

Somehow, these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand, baby, should let you, let you know

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

We go together like hand and glove
[Melvin:] Don't destroy our precious love

Somehow these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand should let you know

How much I love you (love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

// It's Growing //

Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill, it's growing.
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel, it's growing.
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun, it's growing.
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, wooo, it's growing.

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.
My love for you just grows and grows.
Oh, how it grows and it grows.
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows.

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows)
How it grows, and it grows, and it grows.
(Nobody knows) Wooo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody knows. It grows, it grows, where is it gonna stop)

Wooo, like a need in a guy to see his girl.
When she's gone away, it's growing.
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay, wooo, it growing.

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.
My love for you just grows and grows.
Oh, how it grows and it grows.
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows.

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider.
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger.
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby.
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah.
(Hey, hey, hey) Oooo, so much... oooo, so much.
Can't you see it's growing, baby
It grows, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows.

// Who's Lovin' You //

When I had you here
I treated you bad
And wrong my dear
And since
Oh, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder
Who is loving you

I, I, I should have never, ever, ever made you cry
And since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder
Who is loving you

Life without love
Don't you know it's oh so lonely
I don't think
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Well my life
All my love I devote to you only
Come on and take it
Come on and take it
Because all
All I can do
All I can do since you've been gone is cry
And since, boy, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down
And I wonder, who is loving you
Wonder who is loving you

// What's So Good About Good-Bye //

What's so good about goodbye
All it does is make you cry
Well if leavin' causes grief
Goodbye can break your heart

Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
Won't somebody tell me now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares

And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair
I could have done without it
Ah, you and I could never say this is goodbye
Girl, well it makes me so sad
Until it's got to be bad

Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye
Baby, baby what's so good about goodbye
You said goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
But if everything goes wrong lovers stay so long

Tell me what's so good about goodbye
I could have done without it
Won't somebody tell me now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair
I could have done without it

// You Beat Me To The Punch //

That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted, to ask your name but I...was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
That you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me my name.

You beat me to the punch
That time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.

After, I had known you for what seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch.
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours.

You beat me to the punch
One more time
You beat me to the punch
Yes you did.

Since I loved you
I thought you would be true
And love me tender
So I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did.
But I found out
Beyond a doubt
One day, boy
You were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me
Blue.
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day.

And beat you to the punch
Yes I will
I'll beat you to the punch
This time.

Hmmmmmm.....
Yooooooooou....

that you can depend on
when your whole world's falling in.
When you need a friend,

when the whole world seems unfair...
when no one seems to care,

You can depend on me.

When life seems not worth living..
and nothing seems to be going right,
the comfort my love will be giving..giving
will change your darkness to light.

when you need me
when the whole seems unfair
when no one seems to care,
you can depend depend on
Yeah, yeah,
you can depend on me.
