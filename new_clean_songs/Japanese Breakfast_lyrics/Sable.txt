Album: Sable

// Main Menu //

Find a way, find a sun
I'm fonder to
Waiting for
A final way to come home as someone new
In time

// Glider //

Come in to me, show us the way
I'm caught between the wind and parts of the unknown
A door between two worlds
A sight to see

It feels like everything is moving
Around me
It feels like it is moving
In time

Glider caught the breeze
Feels like flying
Every particle in synch
Come on and guide me
Glider
Glider

// Better The Mask //

Something happens every day
Whether not you're part
No matter if you wait
But if you're bold and trying to find
Whatever waits, whichever end
You play a part
And if in time you found that you've doubled back
Learn to rely on a future you made
In which it gets better
