// Rich Man's Spiritual //

Gonna but me a long white robe
Yes Lord to help me home
I'm gonna buy me a long white robe
Yes Lord to get me home
And when I get my heavenly gown
And I lay my burden down
I'm gonna get me a long white robe to get me home 
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers
Yes Lord to walk me home
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers
Yes Lord to walk me home
And when I get my slippers of gold
Then the Lord will have my soul
I'm gonna get me two golden slippers to get me home 

I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver
Yes Lord to fly me home
I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver
Yes Lord to fly me home
And when I get my silvery wings
Then an angel choir will sing
I'm gonna get me two wings of silver to get me home 

I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble
Yes Lord to help me home
I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble
Yes Lord to help me home
And when I get my trouble and woe
Then homeward I will go
I'm gonna get a little trouble and woe to get me home 

I'm gonna find me a smilin' angel
Yes Lord to lead me home
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel
Yes Lord to lead me home
And when he takes me by the hand
I know the Lord will understand
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home

// Long River //

Where the long river flows
It flows by my window
Where the tall timber grows
It grows 'round my door
Where the mountains meet the sky
And the white clouds fly
Where the long river flows
By my window 
There's a tiny bird that calls
And he calls by my window
There's a lonely tear that falls
And it falls 'round my door
But when the sun is high
There's no time to cry
Where the long river flows
By my window 

Now if only you could see
The closin' of the day
If only you could be
Where the dawn breaks away
By the white cascade
Oh down in the glade
Where the long river flows
By my window 

Well when this land was made
It was made full of wonder
But one woman's love
I can't understand
And I'd give it all to you
If her love were true
Where the long river flows
By my window
Where the long river flows
By my window

// For Lovin' Me //

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Ev'ry thing you had is gone
As you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me 
I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
'Cause movin' is my stock in trade
I'm movin' on
I won't think of you when I'm gone. 

So don't you shed a tear for me
B'cause I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through 

Now there you go you're cryin' again
Now there you go you're cryin' again
But then someday when your poor heart
Is on the mend
Well I just might pass this way again 

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything you had is gone
As you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me

// The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face //

The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies my love
To the dark and the empty skies 
The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth turn in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command 

The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat close to mine
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And would last 'till the end of time my love
And would last 'till the end of time 

The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies my love
To the dark and the empty skies

// Changes //

Sit by my side come as close as the air
Sharin' a memory of grey
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play
Of changes 
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade
Of changes 

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn
Of changes 

Passions will part to a warm melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls
Of changes 

Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shore
Of changes

// Early Morning Rain //

In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows
Now, the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, well she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar - see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound - far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down - it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

// Steel Rail Blues //

Well I got my mail late last night
A letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too
To take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I been out here many long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I been stood up I bin shook down
I been dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I been uptight most every night
Walkin' along the streets of this old town
Not a friend around to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down
'Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I look over yonder across the plain
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal 
And Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Now here I am with my hat in my hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round
And I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love

// Sixteen Miles //

Early in the morning when the dew is on
Each and every rose bud you will find me gone
So knock me down and pick me up
And knock me down again
Break my heart steal my gold
And slander my good name 
Seven lonely hours on the morning train
Takes me to a place where I won't come back again
Seven lonely Pullmans speedin' down the line
Takin' me away from an old love of mine

Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines
In some hidden valley where the twirlin' river twines
Where the fish swim up and down
And the sparklin' water falls
Where the thunder rolls
And the lonely puma calls 

Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again
Somewhere in the wilderness
I'll build a cabin small
Then forget so I
Won't remember you at all

// I'm Not Sayin' //

I'm not sayin' that I love you
I'm not sayin' that I'll care if you love me
I'm not sayin' that I'll care
I'm not sayin' I'll be there when you want me 
I can't give my heart to you
Or tell you that I'll sing your name up to the sky
I can't lay the promise down
That I'll always be around when you need me 

Now I may not be alone each time you see me
Along the street or in a small cafe
But still I won't deny or mistreat you
Baby if you let me have my way 

I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry
For all the things that I might say that make you cry
I can't say I'll always do
The things you want me to
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try 

Now I may not be alone each time you see me
Or show up when I promised that I would
But still I won't deny or mistreat you
Baby if you love me like you should 

I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry
For all the things that I might say that make you cry
I can't say I'll always do
The things you want me to
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try
I can't say I'll always do
The things you want me to
I'm not sayin' I'll be true but I'll try

// Pride Of Man //

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 
Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again 

And only God can lead the people back into the faith again
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord

// Ribbon Of Darkness //

Ribbon of darkness over me
Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me 
Clouds a-atherin' o'er my head
That kill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me 

Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye 

Ribbon of darkness over me
Where once the world was young as spring
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing
Ribbon of darkness over me 

Here in this cold room lyin'
Don't want to see no one but you
Lord I wish I could be dyin'
To forget you 

Oh how I wish your heart could see
How mine just aches and breaks all day
Come on home and take away
This ribbon of darkness over me

// Oh, Linda //

Oh Linda you done me wrong
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song
Sing a song that's most unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind 
Oh Linda you made me grieve
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling 
Down from your sky 

Oh gal don't you say goodbye
Now that I need you by my side
Love me now or be on your way
If you go be gone to stay 

I saw Linda late last night
Dressed for town she looked alright
Painted eyes and lips like wine
Walkin' on down with a friend of mine 

Oh gal don't you say so long
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling 
Down from your sky 

Oh gal don't you be unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind
Love me now or be on your way
If you go be gone to stay 

Oh Linda you made me grieve
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling 
Down from your sky 

Oh gal don't you say goodbye
Now that I need you by my side
You can have everything I own
Take everything but a-come on home 

Oh gal don't you say so long
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling 
Down from your sky 

Oh gal don't you do me wrong
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song
Sing a song that's most unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind

// Peaceful Waters //

The dead leaves of autumn
That cling so desperately
Must fly before the cold October winds
Their simple lives have ended
Must they be born to die again 
Oh may the light of freedom shine
For all the world to see
And peace and joy to all mankind
Through all the years to be 

For soon the leaves will die
And the long hard wind will blow
May this world find a resting place 
Where the peaceful waters flow
