// Drifters //

I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you
Your wishes would come true if I had my say
Whether it's right or wrong the words of every song
Remind us of a love we knew where love should not go wrong
In yesterday 
Hang on ye drifters now you got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand where ever you may ramble 

Even now as I look back and see all that's come to pass
I can't remember how it was I got here
Look around this place there's a smile on every face
We're somewhere in the afterglow out there among the stars
Out there among the bars 

Hang on ye drifters now you got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide where ever you may travel. 

I know I should not complain because life's been good to me
It feels real good to be stranded on my own
Be that as it may be we are what we are
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars
Of yesteryear 

Hang on ye drifters now you got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand where ever you may ramble 

All you drifters now you got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide where ever you may travel.

// My Little Love //

I've got a song that it is my mind, my little love who is never unkind
I'm a poet and I'm better off dead. These are the words she said 
Down by the breadline pickin' up dough, hand me the guitar, there I'll go
I would rather make a living instead, instead of bein' in the red 

My little love from the world outside, helpin' me keep, turnin' the tide
Come and meet me by the neon light. And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love 

My little love movin' in my soul, my little love who will never turn cold
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, it doesn't matter if I ain't behaved 

My little love you been on my side, helpin' me keep turnin' the tide
Havin' a hard time livin' right now, havin' a hard time showin' ya how 

My little love from the world out there, helpin' me keep a-doin' my share
Come and meet me by the neon light, And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love 

Down by the breadline pickin' up dough, hand me the guitar, there I'll go
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, it doesn't matter if I ain't behaved 

I got a light that is in my soul, I got a love that'll never turn cold
Come and meet me by the neon light. And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love

// Ringneck Loon //

Hear the call of the ringneck loon
Hear the sound he will be home soon
Hear the cry in the afternoon 
Ringneck loon, he knows best
He's a loon and he don't care less
Ringneck loon, away off shore
How could anybody ask for more 

Hear the call of the ringneck loon
Hear the sound he will be home soon
Hear the cry in the afternoon 

Ringneck loon, he can't rest
He's a loon and he don't care less
Ringneck loon around the bend
Been a loon since he don't know when 

Hear the call of the ringneck loon 

City life is what I see
City life is the life for me
Ringneck loon, he knows best
He's a loon and he don't care less 

Hear the cry of the ringneck loon
Hear the sound he will be home soon
Hear the cry in the afternoon 

Ringneck loon, you can't rest
You're a loonie and you don't care less
Ringneck loon my old friend
Been a loon since he don't know when 

Hear the cry of the ringneck loon
Hear the sound he will be home soon
Hear the cry in the afternoon

// I Used To Be A Country Singer //

I was sittin' in my hotel room, strummin' my old guitar
Not much to do when you're far away, playin' some smokey bar
I was feelin' a little empty and feelin' a little blue
When the maid came in and asked me if she could do my room 
I put down my old guitar and she gave me a smile
She had a crusty voice and a drinker's look, but she had a friendly style
She dusted my room and made my bed and she talked of days gone by
She spoke of when she wooed the men; a tear came to her eye 

And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean Patsy Cline
My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter
Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine 

She told me that her husband died and her son was overseas
I could tell by her eyes and her broken smile she was lonely just like me
She asked me if I'd listen to a tape of when she was young
She said I can't sing now I forgot the words and my voice is almost gone 

And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean Patsy Cline
My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter
Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine 

Oh I cried inside but I couldn't tell if it was for her or for me
So I grabbed my axe and we sang a song in two part harmony
Ever since that day when I'm feelin' down and I can't find a happy tune
I just think if that maid and the feeling she gave, when she came to clean my room 

And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean Patsy Cline
My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter
Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine 

And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean Patsy Cline
My husband he could yodel like Wilf Carter
Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine
Kitty Wells was a real good friend of mine

// Boathouse //

I would rather be at the boathouse, out of the daily grind
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to be set back
So I'm leavin' here on a one-way track 
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane
You should see my mosquiot tally, all that moves is fair game
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose 

I can't sleep by a gentle ocean, I can't sleep my a water fall
I can't sleep by a lovely river. I can't sleep. I can't sleep 

Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee 

I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say
I'd soon eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to step aside
So I'm leavin' here on a wicked ride 

Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two
A few blocks south of the jailhouse, with a hole in my shoe
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to stop a truck
So I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck
I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck 

I can't sleep by a gentle ocean, I can't sleep my a water fall
I can't sleep by a lovely river. I can't sleep. I can't sleep 

Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee 

I'd rather be in mosquito alley, keepin' spiders in line
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose 

Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee

// Much To My Surprise //

I saw two dreamers dreamin'
They almost caused a spark
I saw two lovers in paradise
Right back at the start
I saw to minds in the world set free
But it almost broke my heart 
Isn't it strange to be right now
Havin' you close to me
Much to my surprise 

I saw two schemes schemin'
They almost caused a lark
They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree
Right back at the park
They were like two ships and they sailed right by
Each other in the dark 

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play
So much for your disguise 

I saw two souls out searchin'
They said their last goodbyes
And I saw two hearts of passion then
Much to my surprise
I saw two hearts on passion bent
The kind which mystifies 

It is so strange to be right now
Having you on my knee
Much to my surprise 

I gotta make you see somehow 

I saw two minds that wandered
They almost caused a wreck
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea
When someone cried hit the deck
I saw two minds in the world set wise
But I almost broke my specs 

Wouldn't ya like to be right now
Out where the actors play
So much for your disguise 

Much to my surprise

// A Painter Passing Through //

Once upon a time I was on my own
Once upon a time like you've never known
Once upon a time I would be impressed
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed
Once upon a time, once upon a day when
I was in my prime, once along the way 
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history 

Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait
Once upon a time, once upon a day when
I was in my prime, once along the way 

If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground 

I was in my stride, always at my game
Here comes mister cool, along the walk of fame
I was in demand, always in control
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold
Once upon a time, I was in a daze when
I was in my prime, once along the way 

If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history 

Now that I am old, let me rest a spell
All that I am told, I can never tell
Never in my life, never will it pass
I am still alone, remembering at last
Once upon a time, once upon a day when
I was in my prime, once along the way 

If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground 

If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history

// On Yonge Street //

See the people walkin' up and down
See the people movin' all around
On the streets of my hometown on Yonge Street
Longest street in the world they say
Summertime soon slips away
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street 
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow 

See the children jumpin' all around
See the parents looking up and down
Upon the streets of my hometown on Yonge Street
It's a mean street if you choose
It's a lean street when you lose
An in-between street when you cruise on Yonge Street 

Everywhere you go in a city by the lake
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take
Everyone you pass seems to want to say hello
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow 

It's the longest street in the world
With the most feet in the world
Another street where boy meets girl on Yonge Street
See the people walkin' up and down
See the people movin' all around
Those are the streets of my hometown on Yonge Street 

Everywhere you walk people almost say hello
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow 

On Yonge Street
On Yonge Street

// Red Velvet //

Four months ago in April on a daycoach she came down
And the dust autumn winds begin to blow
Shoulda known I couldn't hold livin' out so far from town
And the nights to come are long are slow to go 
Well now she's up and left me and when walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn wind begins to blow
All dressed up in red velvet and he high heeled shoes so fine
And the nights to come are long and slow to go 

Well if I had only know before we kissed
You can't keep red velvet on a poor dirt farm like this 

Oh now she's gone and left me and went walkin' down the line
And the dusty autumn winds begin to blow 

Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go 

Well I'll sit and count the evening stars as they walk around
When the dusty autumn winds begin to blow
Then I'll call my dog and I'll take the truck and I'll drive on into town
Cause the nights to come are long and slow to go
And those dusty autumn winds begin to blow
