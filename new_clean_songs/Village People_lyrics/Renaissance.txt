// Do You Wanna Spend The Night //

Do you wanna spend the night                        

The party is nearly over                            
Will you have this dance with me                    
I've watched you here for hours                                             
set up with the passion lit                          
I feel my passion darling                            
and my heart beats just with you                    
The evening is to the fantasy                       
Tell them what you gonna do                         

Do you wanna spend the night                        
I wanna be with you                                 
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Say you want to see me too                          
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Welcome baby baby                                   
Do you wanna spend the night                        

Oh baby when i wanna be with you                    
Oh honey don't you wanna see me too                 
Oh baby there's so much that we can do              
Oh honey!!                                          

Do you wanna spend the night                        
I wanna be with you                                 
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Say you want to see me too                          
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Come on baby, baby                                  
you wanna spend the night                        

Hapiness of heart is said                           
Is just a kiss away                                 
So acuse me baby let it see                         
and trust it when they say                          
I feel my body in tremble                           
and the earth's last quake                          
i never meant this ecstasy                          
How much more can i take                            

Do you wanna spend the night                        
I wanna be with you                                 
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Say you want to see me too                          
Do you wanna spend the night                        
Come on baby, baby                                  
Do you wanna spend the night                        

Well now honey                                      
Let's spend the night with heart at dice            
Just you, just me underneath the lights             
Oh honey there's so much that we can do             
Don't quit me                                       

Do you wanna spend the night                        
I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the night
Say you want to see me too
Do you wanna spend the night
Come on baby, baby
Do you wanna spend the night

Do you wanna spend the night
There's so much that we can do
Do you wanna spend the night
No one can love you like i do 
Do you wanna spend the night
Come on baby, baby
Do you wanna spend the night

Do you wanna spend the night
I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the night
Say you want to see me too
Do you wanna spend the night
I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the night
Say you want to see me too

// 5 O'Clock In The Morning //

It's five o'clock in the morning, the city seems so empty
As I wander in the streets alone
It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is awaking
I don't wanna go to sleep alone

And now I feel like such a fool because I've broken all the rules
And I hurt the one who loves me, when I just turned and walked away
There wasn't much that you could say except to say you really loved me

It's five o'clock in the morning, my mind's gettin' weary
As I walk the lonely street again
It's five o'clock in the morning and I feel very sorry
'Cause your love I'll never be again

I guess I'm gonna have to face that I just couldn't run the race
I always thought I was a winner
When your love I'm gonna lose, it makes it easier to choose
Because I'm not a good beginner

Woh baby (baby), I need your love, oh baby (baby), I want your love
Oh baby (baby), bring back your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh

It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is so silent
Can't you hear the lonely beat of my heart
It's five o'clock in the morning, this feeling is so helpless
I can't stop the lonely beat in my heart

Well I don't know what I should do, so I'll leave it up to you
Maybe some day you'll forgive me
So until then I'll play the part of a man with a broken heart
And hope someday you will free me

Oh baby (baby), I need your love, oh baby (baby), I want your love
Oh baby (baby), bring back your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh

It's five o'clock in the morning, the city seems so empty
As I wander in the streets alone
It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is awaking
I don't wanna go to sleep alone

It's five o'clock in the morning, the city seems so empty
As I wander in the streets alone
It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is awaking
I don't wanna go to sleep alone

// Fireman //

The fire is burning
You feel it down below
The flames are getting hotter
You wanna let your body go
You trying to hold back
You can't fight your desire
So come on, now honey, let's jump into the fire

And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fireman
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can
And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping

The smoke is a-rising, the feeling of the sky
Your body is calling, I see love in your eyes
There's no need to fear it, I'll be your fireman
So come on, now honey, let's get some while we can

And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fireman
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can
And there be no stopping no
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can hey

And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
No you better grab some while you can
And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can

Your passion is boiling, I see it on your face
The flames are arising, they're filling up the place
You want me, I know it, and that's a natural fact
So come on, now honey, let's jump into the act

And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can
And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can oh

And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can
And there be no stopping
'Cause I'm your fire man
Honey there's no stopping
You better grab some while you can ooh

// Jungle City //

Country's all I can see, just buildings and me
Standing here in the jungle
People out on the streets they're so hard to meet
I'm alone in the jungle
Workers living all day burn more than their pay
That's life in the jungle
Traffic's backed up for miles, can't see any smiles
Out here in the jungle

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city, jungle city

Soft fuels fill up the air, it's too much to bear
Down here in the jungle
Crime is here everywhere, some people don't care
It's the law of the jungle
Now it's time to be free, people can't you see
Dying here in the jungle
So hurry up don't you be late, they may lock the gate
You'll be lost in the jungle

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city, jungle city

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city

// Big Mac //

Well, I've worked all over this world
And I've been in all kinds of places
From the sushi bars in Japan
To a crazy dart in Notre Dame
But there's only one thing I'm sure
When I'm hungry I need a cure
So when I first get into town
I just drink those patches down

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac

Well I'm not the kind to raise a fuss
But I know what it takes to please me
Not a taco that's hot off the grill
Or the spicey dishes served in Brazil
But when I'm driving in a hurry
And my eyes start getting blurry
Ain't no need to think it's the end
There's a fortune around the bend

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac

I'm so hungry, still not satisfied

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac

// Diet //

D-I-E-T, D-I-E-T
You eat all the time
You sleep with Twinkies on your mind
And candy driving you insane
Food's on your brain

Ice cream by the pound
You're hiding junk food all around
Your belly grows more every day
Health's on its way

Diet
You'll feel better if you try it
Don't you know you better diet
Or you're gonna have to pay!
So diet
You'll feel better if you try it
Don't you know you gotta diet?
Or you're gonna roll away!

Shoplift by the bowl
You know you're losing all control
You've got a junk food misery
But you can't see

Get it back in hand
You've got the power to command
You've got to curb your appetite
Put up a fight

Diet (yes, diet)
You'll feel better if you try it (you gotta try it baby!)
Don't you know you better diet?
Or you're gonna have to pay! (you can do it!)

(Why don't you?) Diet (you got to see it through!)
You'll feel better if you try it (you'll see a brand new you!)
Don't you know you gotta diet (do what you got to do!)
Or you're gonna roll away!

(All right everybody, down on your stomachs, 20 push-ups, 200 sit ups, get the sweat out, get the lead out, let's see ya! Lose those pounds and fatties!)

D-I-E-T, diet!

Diet (don't you hear what I gotta say)
You'll feel better if you try it (you can't afford to let it go another day)
Don't you know you better diet (gotta love your body!)
Or you're gonna have to pay! (you can do it!)

(Why don't you?) Diet (it's not a hard thing to do)
You'll feel better if you try it (you'll see a brand new you!)
Don't you know you gotta diet (you got to see it through!)
Or you're gonna roll away! (you can do it!)

(Why don't you?) Diet (don't you hear what I gotta say)
You'll feel better if you try it (you can't afford to let it go another day)
Don't you know you better diet (you got to love your body!)
Or you're gonna have to pay! (you can do it!)

(Why don't you?) Diet (it's not a hard thing to do!)
You'll feel better if you try it (you'll see a brand new you!)
Don't you know you gotta diet (first you got to see it through!)
Or you're gonna roll away!

D-I-E-T, D-I-E-T, D-I-E-T, diet!

// Food Fight //

Food fight!
1, 2, 1, 2, 3!

Standing here waiting in the same old line
I gotta find something just to pass the time
Is there anything better left for me to do?
Food fight!

People standing in front of me, people at the back
I'm just avoiding something that we lack
So grab yourself a weapon, get ready to attack
Food fight!

Food fight
Food fight
Food fight

I'm looking at my teacher, I got him a size
Grab her a banana and rub her in the eyes
I hit him with an apple, I hit him with a pie
Food fight!

Food to the left of me, food to the right
Food's flying everywhere, everywhere in sight
Now we got the teacher joining in the fight
Food fight!

Food fight
Food fight
Food fight, oh!

People standing in front of me, people at the back
