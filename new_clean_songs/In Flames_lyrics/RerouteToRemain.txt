Album: RerouteToRemain

// Reroute To Remain //

[Verse:]
It started as a whisper
Now try to dodge this roar
Unified, the most forceful way to go

Waste this one?
It's up to you!
We need this revolution

Destroy the pattern
Anything that separates
Across the times.
Who dares to follow?

[Pre-Chorus:]
For years we wandered these circles
Hold onto whatever lie gets us through

[Chorus:]
Design new latitudes
Find ways to channel bliss
Us defined, it's too fragile to neglect
Reroute to Remain
Reroute to Remain

[Verse:]
Never want, to look back in greed
Can I please have your attention?

There are mountains to cross
For all that are willing
There a never ending treasures
That await you

// System //

[Verse:]
I cannot frame, that's why I lose control
I aim, I stumble and I fall
Our adaptation can't be faithful
Your world does not attract me

This is the end you see
There is no more truth in me
As if you would deserve it
You are my enemy

I can't ignore the way you make me bleed
I hate when you throw my thoughts against the wall
Got to wake up and make a stand
The desperation forces another mistake

I count again
I know who to blame
My life in vain
Who said I was sane?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Follow your instinct
It usually takes you home
Don't let these words tear you down

You see me hanging
By the end of the rope
I tell you...

[Chorus:]
Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for you

[Verse:]
I blame and run, sadly all too often
I dive into the day without your sympathy
I tend to try but lack the focus
Becoming a distant memory

What once was is quickly forgotten
All wrapped up inside
Delete all resemblance
I feel your relief

// Drifter //

It's hard to believe
You could be such a disease
I can no longer separate what is real
Hope that fate will find me safe

All my reflections laugh at me
You made me hide my name
It just feels bad to say,
That there'll be another day

[Pre-Chorus:]
What you wanted was impossible to define
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

[Chorus:]
What you wanted is a mystery to me
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

Building a room with no doors
Is this the last of me?
Wring the rag for the last few drops
Falling into infinity

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

// Trigger //

[Verse:]
Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you

I need to find
Something to blame for a long lost time

[Pre-Chorus:]
I am running from something that I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

[Verse:]
Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

[Chorus:]
From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today 'cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

[Verse:]
My friend avoid infinity
Are you for real?

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

// Cloud Connected //

[Verse:]
People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear you're the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill?
Or should I be left behind?

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

[Chorus:]
I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

[Verse:]
You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given?

You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
As we're heading that way

// Transparent //

Consume all the obscene
Persuade the most hideous and ugly
Under every pile and stone
A rebirth, for you to find

Freedom is to be able
To go in any direction
So take the uncertain path

[Pre-Chorus:]
One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself

[Chorus:]
Secrets left above the grave (It's not for one to keep)
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken (see what became of their mistake)
You know you're lost when you feel transparent

[Verse:]
Be at one with the wind
Even if it's a struggle
Make this your priority

Open all your senses
To new impressions
Act like all that was has vanished

// Dawn Of A New Day //

[Verse:]
The thoughts of yesterday forgotten
I like the way this new skin feels
Bring me splinters of tomorrow
Collect the parts where I win

[Chorus:]
Against the grain
Against the odds
I'll rise and I won't trip again
The dawn of a new day never looked
As good as this

[Verse:]
Concrete breath and dust filled tears
A one way ride to inner peace
I never thought I'd join the others
Those who use the dice to solve

// Egonomic //

[Verse:]
A mass illusion
Blind men in a line
They smother their fires with gasoline

A stranger's contribution
Everybody's on the run
No clue where they are heading

A spineless attempt
Have we lost it completely?
It always ends up in a mess

[Chorus:]
A liar's ambition
Praised like a king
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

You won't go far
With the life that you're living
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

[Verse:]
Slow and calculated
Afraid of the sleeping
We'll never ever reach the goal

// Minus //

[Verse:]
Drug me, infiltrate my never land
Like the floodtide drowning the shore

Drug me, you're all over me
Watch my blood begin to boil

I love that lullaby
Start me up again
Electric spine
Open mind

[Pre Chorus:]
I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

[Chorus:]
Inhale the light
Relax for some time
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight

[Verse:]
Please me, deliver the insane
In the chaos I find peace

Please me, remind the gods of my name
I believe there is one seat left for me

// Dismiss The Cynic //

[Verse:]
Will we find a solution
When we add all the numbers?
Like they are supposed to be?
But no is close... Start all over!

If we fail our expectations
We will fall into the deepest void
Is there a limit to how many times
We will dust ourselves off?

[Chorus:]
The mystery of time
Listen to me, carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need

[Verse:]
Would you choose supremacy
If it led to isolation?
Could you handle the solitude?
Would you still prefer the throne?

// Free Fall //

[Verse:]
Mirror Mirror
How far will I go?
Despite the foundation I am falling
Sweet reflection
Will you save a place for me?

Where am I heading?
Could you grant me a haven?
For what?
I am punished could I ever repent?

Mother Nature, I'm wide open
Waiting for you to move me

Don't keep it from me
This is a free fall

[Chorus:]
I never seem to understand
The time, the place and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie

[Verse:]
Father time every time I stop and feel
You're there to tell me I'm already late

// Dark Signs //

[Verse:]
Held down, strangled and abused
Cut down to half a member
Left with his hand tied
Everything points in the wrong direction

All the joy disappeared
The negative has penetrated
Once he was in control
What's left, the faintest laughter

[Chorus:]
We're out of focus, we've lost control
I blame our ego and you call me names

You're told that you are trapped below
And dark signs helped to prove
You got to reach further
For what life shall provide

[Verse:]
Feeling pressure from the fold
He believes the dream is over
Drained blue eye, scorching fire
The whole meaning becomes undone

// Metaphor //

[Verse:]
You stole my pure intention
You are the sickness in between
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You taught me to be sad at you
You almost made me take it all
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You bend me and you shake me
You beg me then you break me
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You made me feel like a sinner
Now you fear you'll die alone
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

[Chorus:]
The sickness that you are
The plague that made me starve
You think you can show me how I've come this far

I feel it's taking over
Everything falls dark
Break me open
The desperate cry

// Black & White //

[Verse:]
I am one with the world tonight
I am proud to be this far from you

You say that you have no regrets
But I know that you do
You told me someone stole the eye
I know him too

[Chorus:]
I've come to the conclusion, yes I know
That between black and white
There is no room for two
The scale it might be wide
But there's no need to be blind
Between black and white there is no room for two

[Verse:]
I leave all the grey behind
I see clear, I know that I'll find

You claim that you are innocent
But tell me who ain't
You think that you're going to be saved
There's no such thing as a saint

Black and White
There's nothing in between
Black and White
Nothing's what it seems
