Album: Battles

// Drained //

What we had we threw away
We were close to heaven
But we ended up in hell
What we had we threw away

Just cause the hurt doesn't show
There's no way to recover
You broke my heart in two
I had a dream of growing old
I saw us driving to the end of the road

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

I'm drained and out of phase
I was shooting straight but you stole my aim
Could have walked for miles
We were supposed to be the end of the line

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

You killed the part of me that kept us alive

We had this world of make believe
I thought I saw the fire in your eyes

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You ripped the heart out of my will to survive
You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

You ripped the heart out, you ripped the heart out
You killed the part of me that kept us alive

// The End //

I got a new kind of fear
Something you don't wanna view
There's this path that I can see
It leads straight to misery
We can't undo what we have done
Just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble
The fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end?
That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space

What if I say to you
Let's leave this earth for a while
A perspective from the hollow
And the wheel we can't control

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end?
That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

When we were young
Was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing
We need to find our way back

I can't tell you what to do
This crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become
We'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end?
That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath
And the emptiness in space

// Like Sand //

I believe that the whole wide world is against me
I, I, I believe that the whole wide world is afraid of me

How did I end up here
Half a life and still full of fears
If I'm honest I think you'll see
I'm scared to share what's calling for me
You say, make the most of your time
How's it work when it's not on your side
What can't kill you makes you stronger
So I heard but I'm going under

I will try, I will try
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
(I want the whole world)

I try hard to be like you
You're my Queen but I break in two
I think I can overcome all the mistakes that I've done
You say, make the most of your time
How's it work when it's not on your side
What can't kill you makes you stronger
So you say but I'm going under

I will try, I will try
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand

I believe that the whole wide world is afraid of me

I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand

// The Truth //

We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are

The time has come to bring you down
Take the power back and show you how
I hear the sound of a plane passing by
Someone have the same thoughts as I
But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything's fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed

Why can't we see eye to eye?
Think of all the things we leave behind
I hear the sound of a car driving by
You can go on for miles
But you will run out, this is not your day
Are you just gonna turn around and walk away?

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed

But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything's fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed

// In My Room //

Here in my room
I'm behind the wall
I'm out of reach
I don't sympathize
Adjusting the level of delusion
Feel like you're one of the sane
Encoding the white noise
Lose my way and fall again

Creating dreams from a broken past
It tears a hole and sucks you dry
If you know secrets tell me now
Creating dreams, let the worlds collide
Escape the void and feel alive
Don't have any answers but I'll survive

Here in my room
I'm behind the wall
Away from the flock
Closure will come
Adjusting the high of expectation
Feel like you're one of the brave
Dig deeper
Find a new path and climb again

Creating dreams from a broken past
It tears a hole and sucks you dry
If you know secrets tell me now
Creating dreams, let the worlds collide
Escape the void and feel alive
Don't have any answers but I'll survive
[x2]

// Before I Fall //

How far to go, I never know
I pushed too hard, so you ran away
I know you bleed for me
And you know, oh, I'm dying for you

A journey with open eyes
From darkness to light

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall

My will to be something more
Oh, say the right words and be what I've promised
I know you bleed for me
I know I will die for you

A journey with open eyes
From darkness to light

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go (won't let go)
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall

Put my fears behind
Put my fears behind
Put my fears behind
Before I fall

The cold is real, that I know
The scars I feel, but I won't let go (won't let go)
I know that I can find the meaning of it all
Put my fears behind before I fall

// Through My Eyes //

You did me wrong and I applauded you
I became the blade and I pierced through
Now hiding from the world outside
Trying to create magic for the pacified

You never felt the answers
Are aimed at you my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect

If you could see it
If you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it
Want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand

You always did prefer to keep me on distance
So no wonder it's served for your intent

You never felt the answers
Are aimed at you my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect

If you could see it
If you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it
Want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand

If you can see it through my eyes
If you can see it through my eyes

You never felt the answers
Are aimed at you my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect

If you could see it
If you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it
Want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand

If you could see it
If you could see it through my eyes (through my eyes)
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it
Want you to know what it was like (it was like)
Then maybe you'll understand
(Then maybe you'll understand)

// Battles //

Pain
You're not my friend and I despise you
Friend
You are my pain and I adore you

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side
As I sit and let the day go by
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

Insane
To be caged, when you're to blame
Blame
Break free from insanity to praise you

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side
As I sit and let the day go by
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

What are you waiting for, I'm here
Let's consume it all (let's consume it all)
Before they take it all away

I hear them from the other side (other side)
As I sit and let the day go by (day go by)
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Before they take it all away
I hear them from the other side (other side)
As I sit and let the day go by (day go by)
Trying to see if the world is still alive
Let the day go by

// Here Until Forever //

I can't wait to hear your voice again
I am far from lonely but without you I'm a mess
I close my eyes and drift away
And I'm wondering what you're doing now

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be

Mind and soul we are the same
A hand on your heart, you know I am there
You are my lighthouse in the dark
I can see you from a thousand miles

Forever I will always be

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be

I hope you feel that nothing dies
I am alive in all you touch
Close my eyes and drift away
Wondering what you're doing now
(Wondering what you're doing right now)

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me (I see me)

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be

// Underneath My Skin //

Waiting for miracles to appear
All the heights I did aspire
Seems forever gone
A torn and shredded grin to fit the blackened day
Shoveling the ashes from the times of selfish ways

I'm taking more than I can give
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live
There's nothing underneath my skin
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live

Falling like stars from the sky
Burned out before the trial
And are forever gone
Kneel and pray to find the right way back inside
Been to hell and back but still I feel I'm blind

I'm taking more than I can give
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live
There's nothing underneath my skin
Is this the life I wanna live?
The life I wanna live
[x2]

Is this the life I wanna live?
Is this the life I wanna live?

// Wallflower //

I like to look at you from a distance
I like when you scream in my face
Afraid to say the right words, in right order
So they make sense to a person with such grace

What if my dreams don't become reality?
Is my life just a big mistake?
Will I be happy for the times I had
Or would I reconsider and recalculate?

I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space
I want to be
I want to be
Leave no trace
I want to be
I want to be
Take no space

The older I get, the younger I feel
The younger I feel, the older I seem
The more I feel, my age seems real
I like to pretend I'm as young as I feel

I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space
I want to be
I want to be
Leave no trace
I want to be
I want to be
Take no space

Leave no trace
Take no space
I want to be heard but leave no trace
I want to be seen but take no space

// Save Me //

So save me

Here's a hammer
Build a ladder
It's a long way up to heaven
If I dig it might take as long
But maybe in hell that's where I belong
Seven days and seven nights
Funny he found the fires
And I have walked this path before

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my dream

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me
So save me

So save me
(Save me...)

Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my charade

I'm afraid I'd lose it all

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Save me
Save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

Save me...
Save me...
Save me...
Save me...

// Greatest Greed //

I sold you once (once!)
I sold you twice (twice!)
I sold you a third time, and still you're backing out
I hit you once, I hit you twice
You start to scream and still it doesn't count

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are

My head's a mess (mess!)
My broken bones (bones!)
I feel like a victim, but you're not in control
You're filled with rage, one last mistake
You are no victim, just one without a soul

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are

Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?
Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?

A single sound, one-two-three times
The Greatest Greed is just an empty thrive

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are
[x2]

Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?
Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?

// Us Against The World //

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?

You're in control
The thin red line
A change in life
The pride that cries
The lesson we should learn from lies
Dance across the sky
Conqueror of pain
The abandoned reign
You should be lord amongst the flies

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
Tell me what to do
I'm right beside you
It's us against the world
This can only end one way
Let's seize the day
It's us against the world

Oh, through the cracks
A new voice appears
Dividing the clouds
The horizon, the hope
From the most lonesome nights

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
Tell me what to do
I'm right beside you
It's us against the world
This can only end one way
Let's seize the day
It's us against the world
