Album: Foregone

// State Of Slow Decay //

It is my reflection
But I know it's not me
I am becoming something else
I feel the weight of the key

This place is falling apart
There's no way back
Passing through the gates
A new shadow will reveal itself

The stories have run their course
None of them make sense
We are all someone else's fool
Buried in our own debris

Destroy the things you know
Destroy yourself in shame
Before tomorrow comes
Destroy everything

Faith alone won't sustain
We're in a state of slow decay
I hear forgive and forget
But I see there's no way

Seen it through the accolades
It all should be a great success
But there are so many burdens
World is heavy and full of distress

The stories have run their course
None of them make sense
We are all someone else's fool
Buried in our own debris

Destroy the things you know
Destroy yourself in shame
Before tomorrow comes
Destroy everything

Faith alone won't sustain
We're in a state of slow decay
I hear forgive and forget
But I see there's no way

// Meet Your Maker //

Oh meet your maker
Say something that makes sense
These are your last words
So make them worth the wait

Meet your maker
It's time to set things straight
These are your last words
So make them count or it's too late

In time we all disappear
We're pushed to the edge
The countdown has begun

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way

(You think you have a choice but there's no other way)

Oh meet your maker
As you receive the final key
These are your last words
Are you ready to see what lies beneath?

Meet your maker
Everything else is dead
This is the final moment
All is done, all is said

In time we all disappear
We're pushed to the edge
The countdown has begun

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way

Oh meet your maker
Say something that makes sense
These are your last words
So make them worth the wait

At the end of the masquerade
Your time's up, now there's hell to pay
It's only down from here
You think you have a choice but there's no other way

// Bleeding Out //

Mother time
Please be gentle, I need to figure this out
It's not black or white
I see colors what is that about?

Caught a glimpse of the end
It's not pretty, no one will win
No one will win

My last breath
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out

I'm the desolate
The one that doesn't want to exist
Still I deserve the answer
For the time that you create

No such thing as a promised land
This is it, dive right in
The brain is such a wonderful thing
No one knows what life will bring

My last breath
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out

My last breathe
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out

// Foregone Pt. 1 //

Find a way to bring me home
Darkness is washing over the sky
When all the trees burned down
Where does the crow fly?

Take this as an offering
Empty promises are dead
All the rage and pain is gone
Soon, all the rivers run red

All that matter is gone
There is nowhere else to go
No place for us to hide
Nothing above and nothing below

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death

It was easy to hide in the crowd
We acted numb to the warnings ahead
With everything that's rotten
Even the marching ants have fled

All that matter is gone
There is nowhere else to go
No place for us to hide
Nothing above and nothing below

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death

// Foregone Pt. 2 //

If you look in the mirror and don't like what's there
It's the one you despise with no tears to spare
(It's the one you despise with no tears to spare)

How did we end up here?
Burn all the empires and face what you fear
(Burn all the empires and face what you fear)

As the day passes we watch the world corrode
Vampires in daylight, the condemned are here to stay

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The Innocent at every breaking wave

Nothing is holy for the clouded eye
The tremors, the thunder, the lights go out
With all the lies, the ultimate consequence
We all know what's the end of this route

As the day passes we watch the world corrode
Vampires in daylight, the condemned are here to stay

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The Innocent at every breaking wave

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The Innocent at every breaking wave

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The Innocent at every breaking wave

// Pure Light Of Mind //

A perfect storm in a turbulent time
I know my days are numbered
But life seems to end up right
You by my side, my guiding light

Wave goodbye with tearful eyes
Wait for me I won't be long

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again

When I was about to breakdown
You took the car heading down south
Dim the lights, I'm going to panic
It's settled, this is forever

Wave goodbye with tearful eyes
Wait for me I won't be long

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again

Take away my pain
Take away my sorrow
Save me from tomorrow
Save me!

I wanna tell you before I die
I walked the mile and I'd do it again
The darkness that became me
You're reason I'm still breathing
I walked the mile and I'd do it again

// The Great Deceiver //

Back to reality once again
A two-year break to reset our brains
(A two-year break to reset our brains)
But times are changing for the worse (the worse)
We are doomed, we are cursed (cursed)

Nothing but pain
This is the end

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry

The lines are drawn and the rules are set
Your actions, the world won't forget
Nowhere to run, there's no escape
Misery's here, there's no hope left

Mankind, too unkind to be renowned
Joey was right, this is the final countdown

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry

// In The Dark //

It seems so real when you whisper
Just like holding down your breath

We're slowly dying
So how do we solve this without regrets?

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

We have to fight through the shadows
I feel we've lost the spark
Ignite the dampened spirits
And build a brand new arc

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

We will burn in the fire
We will be branded in flames
We will have to rise from the ashes
From the fires of our own mistakes

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

This is a war and no one will win it

// A Dialogue In B Flat Minor //

All you see is me breathing fire

Can you see the madness or do I hide it all too well?
Ask the right question, you will have a show and tell
I see spiders crawling up the wall
It's only a matter of time
I lose all sense of control

All the clowns they look the same
Afraid I'm gonna suffocate
Have I gone insane?
Am I the devil's bait?

Give me the strength to fly away
Don't recognize this place, I think I derailed

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I feel like I'm being erased
Can't explain the way I feel
All you see is me breathing fire
Can't explain so you'll believe

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I can't see how things will change
Will those feelings ever fade?

All you see is me breathing fire
Have I gone insane?

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

// Cynosure //

A constant struggle
Lay your hands on me
I am nothing
I am the space in-between

I am the space in-between

Wrestle the demons
Thorns in my side
I am the pain
I am the blame

I feel paranoid
Are you a prophet?
I am the broken
I am the wound

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real

Guilty of nothing
Who's left to blame?
I am the future
(I am the dream)

No more holding down
I prevail
I am the consequence
I am everything

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real

Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say anything, I will be healed
Who's at the wheel?
Say a word, say something that will make it real

// End The Transmission //

Close your eyes, what do you see?
The ashes of a place down on its knees

The world we knew has gone astray
We are the cancer, you and I

Choose your side, there are no winners
Hell is overcrowded and heaven's full of sinners

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening

A new clean slate, it won't be happening
This is the one, so let us begin

Choose your side, there are no winners
Hell is overcrowded and heaven's full of sinners

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening
End the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening

We are but empty vessels with no ambition
No ambition
No ambition

This is a tomb and we are buried alive
We swallowed the spit and lived in denial
The devil has done his deed
Fed our egos and made us bleed
The devil has done his deed
Are all gods on the sidelines?
Passivity is not what the world needs

We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening
End the transmission
Nothing makes sense and we're running out of graves
We got to end the transmission
Nothing makes sense and no one is listening

// Become One //

I've been lost in a tree of stars
Now gravity is pulling hard
Reminding me of the end of time
Or something less defined

Come to terms with everything
That's a game one cannot win
Realize some dreams might die
And let go of the hate inside

I am awake
As I fade away
A perfect place
Here's my soul to take

All my life
I've been searching for this moment
I need this time
To turn it around, become one
The size of my shadow has blackened the sun
I need this time
To turn it around, become one

Heavy footsteps wear me down
I sometimes forget that I'm alive
Everyone will get what's coming
I, for one, am tired of running
