// Voices //

Could you be an angel left in the dark?
It's mostly silence echoing through the halls
Kill the hunters that are lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls

I will search, search through the wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am
That's all I am

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home

Could you be the devil left in my heart?
All these feelings I wish I could turn them off
Kill the hunters that are lying to myself
For long I've seen the signs
Written on these walls
Written on these walls

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home

I will search, search through the wreckage of my soul
Believe in what I have 'cause that's
That's all I am

I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth
Reminding myself to breathe slow
Wandering alone in this wasteland
We used to call home
We used to call home
I swear I could hear
Voices from the edge of the earth

// I, The Mask //

From here I can hardly see a thing
We're further off with every passing second
I will follow anyone that brings me to you
But the sense of time's catching up with me

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?
If I act like I'm untouchable and golden?

Wonder when I'll hit the ground
Been to space but I'm falling
Wasting what is mine (For a voice that's calling)

Who am I?
So many faces
Dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am
In the mask
The jester that wants to be free

I'm done with watching graves grow mold
The sins are mine, I believe them to be

All the tears they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, I'm on my knees
(Feel like you forgotten me)

Who am I?
So many faces
Dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am
In the mask
The jester that wants to be free

How could you leave me behind?
I'm tired and I felt it for sometime
I can't take this much longer
I'm stuck in a downward spiral

I'm stuck in a downward spiral...
I'm stuck in a downward spiral...
I'm stuck in a downward spiral...

All the tears they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy

Who am I?
So many faces
Dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am
In the mask
The jester that wants to be free

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?

// Call My Name //

You don't remember
So I need to figure it out
But the memories fade
The truth is that I'm not so sure
If we'll make it at all
I can't even trust myself

I used to have it all
Until I lost control
I used to have it all
Until I lost control

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
A sign for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

Sometimes I'm angry
And some days I'm totally numb
I just wanna give it all up

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
A sign for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

I used to have it all
Until I lost control
I used to have it all
Until I lost control

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls
Through the halls of time
A sign for me to go by
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side
So find me the wormhole
So that I can be by your side

Until I lost control
Until I lost control

// I Am Above //

Cut my throat and throw me to the wolves
I'm just too tired, too tired to reload
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

I'll be the ghost that haunts you in your sleep
You have anchored the hate in me
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

My god, I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My god, as the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

Maybe, just maybe it takes time to sink in
Did you not hear me loud and clear?
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

My god, I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My god, as the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

My god, I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My god, as the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

// Follow Me //

You say you want it all
But with the demons in your head
You can't see straight
But give me a chance to be the light
To guide you through and be your eyes

The darkness in your soul
Always a part of you
I'll be by your side
Just follow me, follow me

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows away from the let downs
You will find a home

I never thought it would come to this
What are you waiting for?
I forgave myself for my mistakes
Why are you holding on?

From ashes you will rise
I'll walk a thousand miles
You know I'll never give up
Just follow me, follow me

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows away from the let downs
You will find a home

I never thought it would come to this

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows away from the let downs
You will find a home

Follow me, don't be afraid
I will lead you to a better place
Free from the sorrows away from the let downs
You will find a home

// (This Is Our) House //

This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

Have you heard the call?
It involves us one and all
From the rising sun until the day is done
Do you hear the call?

This is our time, we won't back down
From the rising sun until the day is done
Do you hear the call?
This is our time, we won't back down
No we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

Have you heard the call?
Something must be done
From the top of the mountains to the deepest below
Do you hear the call?

This is our time, no we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

From the top of the mountains to the deepest below
From the top of the mountains to the deepest below

This is our time, we won't back down
No we won't back down
This is our time, I hear the sound
Of a thousand drums

Would you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
Please you join me in the fight
The fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"
This is the fight, the fight for our lives
Scream out loud "This is our house!"

// We Will Remember //

We have come so far
Crawled through knives and artifacts
We had a purpose and a reason
Behind space and time

Ignore the fixed ideals
Serve your restless soul
Dedicated to all that's sacred
Measuring noise and sound

Reach a brand new level
Watch the worlds collide
Set yourself on fire
As we remember this forever
We remember this forever

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

Calling our gathered masses
From the colony to the hives
I have come to realize
(This is) not an ordinary story

We're on a highway
Nothing left to lose
Set yourself on fire
As we remember this forever
We remember this forever

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

When the sky is clear we will remember
Through thick and thin we won't surrender
As the years pass, the memories still last
When the sky is clear we will remember

// In This Life //

Breathing the dead
Underneath a sky that used to be blue
Each day living just enough
While the world is coming down

I can't focus, I can't control
Close to expired with a broken soul
The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life

Born to pretend
Anything to stay alive
But walls are closing in
And I'm prepared for the downfall

Wear your wounds with pride
But I have no more space and my body is heavy
Nothing will change my mind
So I wave the world goodbye

The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life

I can't focus, I can't control
Close to expired with a broken soul
The rage has left a hole
So strong I can't ignore

Waiting to cave in
Who am I and what and why
In life, in life
Searching for something
I can't find a smile that is mine
In this life, in life

// Burn //

We're in the ruins of dreams
Vultures and their dead end screams
The fragile sanctuary of home
Spit me out, find another clone

Need a revolution
To find the lost evolution
Waiting for the wind to turn
Avoiding truth and never learn
Never learn, never learn, never learn

So burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes
Let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes

Drop the bombs, build the new
Purge our thoughts for different views
Different mantra, different beat
Still heading for eternal sleep

Devoured by constant pressure
Always for some else's pleasure
Not sure what you see in the scope
Afraid we're running out of hope
Out of hope, out of hope, out of hope

So burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes
Let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes

In the name of a broken spirit
Fight the boundaries and kill it
Trapped inside the villain of man
Apathy, the sickness in our lifespan

So burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes
Let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see

So burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes
Let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn
The world needs to see with open eyes

// Deep Inside //

Don't you feel the need for change?
The light have died in our eyes
The hatred will consume us
Let's free ourselves from the ties

Deep inside we pray for the flood
A cure to wash it away
Been bound to vicious circles
Ignoring the price we have to pay

I've been searching, I feel worthless
(Have to pay)
I've been searching, I feel worthless

Holding out for something new
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games

Too easy to say, too easy to hate
Never make the same mistakes
Where I'm going I couldn't care
But for you this is where it ends

I've been searching, I feel worthless
(Where it ends)
I've been searching, I feel worthless

Holding out for something new
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games

The light have died
Died in our eyes
Free ourselves
From the ties

Holding out for something new
The lies we try to tell
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your spell

Holding out for something new
(The lies we try to tell)
Broken dreams and heartbreak
(We retract to our cell)

Holding out for something new
Running through the flames
Broken dreams and heartbreak
Release me from your games
Release me from your games

// All The Pain //

The eyes of the world are on me
I might not come back from this
On my knees
Fighting the future for all of my beliefs

Broken and discarded
Alone, alone and left behind
Living the illusion
Of a life

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
What have I, what have I done?

Who am I?
I'm a pawn and I've been lying to myself
Ain't caving in
My heart keeps beating
This fight I'm gonna win

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel

Who was I?
Just a pawn and I was lying to myself
Not giving in
My heart still beating

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel
I can't tell right from wrong

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time (for the last time)
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong

// Stay With Me //

Don't ever let them use you
They will bring you to your knees
I'll try to lead you for awhile
But every time I talk to you you're too afraid to see

Open your eyes
(Breathe in life)
Open your eyes
(Breathe in, breathe out)

Oh I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me

Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me

I don't know if you're ready
You should see where I have been
I don't know if you're ready
And I don't know where to begin

Open your eyes
(Breathe in life)
Open your eyes
(Breathe in, breathe out)

Oh I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me

Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me
Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me


I, I can see the light
Stay with me
Away from the darkest of nights
Stay with me


Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me (Stay with me)Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me

Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me (Stay with me)Stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

// Not Alone //

You know better, the things you should have done
It's so easy to avoid, to choose and run
The stronger you feel, push the stone up the hill
Your finest hour going in for the kill

Become the human you are to be
Free yourself from the misery
Wrong way, right way, we all make mistakes
No need for grieving, no matter how much it aches

I'm here to break your fall
I'll wait for you until you come back home

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone

Time's running out, you might be something that you're not
New world order, is that all that you got?
Pull the damn triggers and fire to the sky
This is not the day you die, it's a wonderful life

I'm here to break your fall
I wait for you until you come back home

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone

Pull the damn triggers and fire to the sky
This is not the day you die, it's a wonderful life

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone, the struggle we all own
The Devil's real, you don't need to be scared of the scars
The sense, when everything fails
Search within to find what's in the way
You're not alone
