// Makin' Whoopee //

Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year, maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone
Most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy
But she says, "is he?"
He's makin' whoopee

Now he doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, "You'll pay six to her."

He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"
Judge say, "Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her. I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee."

Yes, yeah, you better keep her
Daddy, I think it's cheaper
Then makin' whoopee

// Willow Weep For Me //

Yes, Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me

Yes, Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Oh, Whisper to the wind and say that love's a sin
Leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing, crying all alone

Oh, willow weep tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love is sin
Leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone

Yes, willow weep tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me
Yes

// Tenderly //

The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Oh tenderly tenderly
Oh oh oh oh

[scat]

Oh yes

// Moonlight In Vermont //

[Ella:]
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves of a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icey finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet, in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

[Louis Armstrong:]

[Instrumental Solo]

[Ella:]
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road

[Louis:]
People who meet, in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

[Ella:]
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

You and I and moonlight in Vermont

[Louis:]
Moonlight in Vermont

// Don't Be That Way //

[Ella]
April skies are in your eyes
But darling, don't be blue
Don't cry,
Oh honey please
Don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way
The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain So honey please don't be that way
As long as we
See it through
You'll have me
I'll have you
Sweetheart
Tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart
Oh honey, please don't be that way

[Louis]
Don't cry,
Oh honey please
Don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way
The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears in vain
So honey please don't be that way
As long as we
Will see it through
You'll have me
And I'll have you
Sweetheart
Tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Don't cry

Don't cry, don't cry
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Oh honey, please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Dig those crazy sky
Should never make you feel that way
So don't be that way
Dig the rain
Pitter pitter pitter pitter patter
Bring the violets of May
Pitter patter of the rain drops
Tears in vain
Tears, tears
So honey please don't be that way
Don't be that way
As long as we
[scat]
Will see it through
[scat]
Oh baby, you'll have me
[scat]

Clouds in the sky

Oh honey, please don't be that way
No honey, I'll never be that way

// I Won't Dance //

[Ella]
Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me
You'd be the idol of France with me
And yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically
While wait here so ecstatically
You just look and say emphatically;

[Louis]
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madam, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do

You know what, you're lovely
And so what? You're still lovely
And oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us! I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance. Why should I?
I won't dance. How could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance

[Ella]
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, monsieur, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do

You know what, you're handsome
And so what? You're handsome
And oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us! I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance. Why should I?
I won't dance. How could I?
I won't dance, merci beau coup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance

[Louis]
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I will not dance, madame, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do

You know what? You're kinda lovely

[Ella]
And so what? I'm lovely

[Louis]
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

[Ella]
When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the continental

[Louis]
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us! I'm not asbestos, honey!

[Ella]
And that's why
I won't dance. Why should I?
I won't dance. How could I?
I won't dance, merci beau coup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
