// Little White Lies //

The moon was all aglow
And heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears

The devil was in your heart
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who ever could doubt those eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies

Those little white, tiny white, little white lies

// You Hit The Spot //

You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a summery day
You hit a new high in my estimation
I have to fall
Cause you've got so much on the ball

Oh you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
You hit the spot
Like the pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly
What it is that you've got
But ooh you hit the spot

You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a summery day
You hit a new high in my estimation
I have to fall
Cause you've got so much on the ball

Oh you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
You hit the spot
Like the pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly
What it is that you've got
But ooh you hit the spot

// What's Your Story Morning Glory //

What's your story, morning glory?
What makes you look so blue?
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you sure as one and one makes two
What's your story, morning glory?
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So won't you tell me that you love me too

What is your story, morning glory?
You've got me worried too
A postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it?
Then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory?
If I guess it darling will you confess it
Or won't you tell me that you love me too?

Oh won't you tell me that you love me too?
What's your story, morning glory?

// Just You Just Me //

Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot round wonderful you

[scat]

To cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

[scat]

You and I
I've never left alone
Our necessities mostly privacy
Every sweetheart that the world has known
Hopes to find someday a perfect hideaway

Just just just you
Just just just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot round wonderful you

// Teardrops From My Eyes //

Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
When the rain starts falling
My love comes tumbling down
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Well if you see clouds
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
Although the sun is shining
There's no more summer skies
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
How it's pouring
Teardrops
Teardrops in my eyes

// Gotta Be This Or That //

Is it yes?
Is it no?
Am I in?
Am I out?

If you ain't wrong you're right
If it ain't dark it's light
If you ain't sure you might
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't full it's blank
If you don't spend you bank
If it ain't Bing it's Frank
Gotta be this or that

Who can it be if it ain't me?
I know it's not your mother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other?

Tell me what I must know
If you don't like I'll go
If it ain't yes it's no
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't old it's new
If it ain't me it's you
If it ain't much it's few
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't sea it's land
If you ain't praised you're panned
If it ain't fresh it's canned
Gotta be this or that

Who can it be if it ain't me?
I know it's not your mother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other?

Tell me what I must know
If you don't like I'll go
If it ain't yes it's no
Gotta be this
It's gotta be that
Gotta be this way
That way or the other

// Moonlight On The Ganges //

Moonlight on the Ganges my little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true

Someday on the Ganges I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore

My little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true

Someday on the Ganges I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore

// My Kinda Love //

My kinda love
Your kinda love
Keeps me believing although you're deceiving
My kinda love
One way to paradise

My kinda lips
Your kinda lips
When love comes stealing encourage that feeling
My kinda love
One way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once don't be a dunce
When you need it
Steal it
Beg or borrow

I'm fond of you
You're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
My kinda love
One way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once don't be a dunce
When you need it
Try to keep it

I'm fond of you
You're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
Your kinda love
Your kind was meant just for me

Steal for it
Beg for or borrow
We may be gone tomorrow
Hug me and squeeze me
One way to paradise

// You're An Old Smoothie //

You're an old smoothie
I'm an old softie
I'm just like putty in the hands of a boy like you

You're an old meanie
I'm a big boobie
I just go nutty in the hands of a boy like you

Poor me
You played me for a sap
Poor you
You thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to

Silly old smoothie
Crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy like you

Poor me
You played me for a sap
Poor you
You thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to

Silly old smoothie
Crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy
A boy like you
I just go nutty in the hands of a boy like you

// You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me //

If the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me

If the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
For you brought a new kind of love to me

I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love to me

I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love
Yes you came from heaven above
For you brought a new kind of love to me

// Knock Me A Kiss //

Knock me a kiss hey baby
Knock me a kiss I'm in maybe
That's what I want from you really baby
Honey

I like cake and no mistake but baby if you insist
I'll cut out a cake just for your sake
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

I like pie
I hope to die just get a load of this
When you get high doggone the pie
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

When you pressed your lips to mine
It was then I understood
They taste like candy brandy and wine
Peaches bananas and everything good

I love jam and no film flam
Scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam
The jam can scram
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

I like cars and big cigars but baby they won't be missed
If everyday I hear you say
Baby come on and knock me a kiss
I crave sights like title fights but if you should insist
I cancel nights and title fights
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

Yes it's wise to compromise in such cases as this
There's nothing world
The light in your eyes
What can compare with the thrill of your kiss?

Scotch and ride are tops with me
But i promise this
If you say so I'll drink ice tea
Baby come on and knock me a kiss
Oh baby oh baby
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

// 720 In The Books //

When the rhythm gets to rockin' on the swing side
And the cats condescend to lend an ear
When the beatniks start to gather 'round the ringside
There's a certain thing they always want to hear
Seven-twenty, seven-twenty in the books

What's the tune they like the best
When the jive becomes deluxe?
What's the number one request?
Seven-twenty in the books

When the band begins to play
You should see the dirty looks
If the leader doesn't say
Seven-twenty in the books

It's something that you'll approve
Gets you right in the groove
To keep in step
You really gotta be hep

Just be like the kangaroo
Or the fishes in the brooks
Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
Seven-twenty in the books

It's something that you'll approve
Gets you out of the groove
To keep in step
You really gotta be hep

Just be like the kangaroo
Or the fishes in the brooks
Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
Seven-twenty in the books

Seven-twenty
Seven-twenty
Seven-twenty
Let's keep jumpin' to seven-twenty in the books
