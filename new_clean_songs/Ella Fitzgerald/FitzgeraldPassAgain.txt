// That Old Feeling //

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old old feeling, yes that old feeling 
Is still in my heart

// The One I Love (Belongs To Somebody Else) //

The one I love belongs to somebody else
He means his tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around him
I know his thoughts are strong for somebody else
I know the hands I hold belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else

The one I love belongs to somebody else
He means his tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around him
I know his thoughts are strong for somebody else
I know the hands I hold belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
Yeah the one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else
