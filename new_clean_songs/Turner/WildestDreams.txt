// Do What You Do //

When you say the things you say you gotta mean it
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart

Something's gone, I can't explain
The heat is missing from the flame
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain...uh uh
There's something wrong with you and me
When one and one adds up to three
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see ...uh uh

It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away
When you do what you do that like you to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love, without love

I'm gonna paint a picture of you
The only colour I need is blue
You're out of love, baby you know it's true...uh uh
Tell me why and I'll try to understand
'Cause I could cry when you do what you do to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love....ah
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away
When you do what you do what you do to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
Then you know it's a crime that you're guilty of
When you do what you do without love, without love
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing with our love

When you do what you it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing...do, got to do it with love)
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing...do it, gotta do it with love)
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing...do it, gotta do it with love)

// Whatever You Want (Me To Do) //

Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
I can't rely on myself, I'm wanting you and no one else
You've got me wrapped up

'Cause time takes what love heals
And deep in my heart I know it's for real

Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
And I, I know that it's real

I know you've had flames in your heart
That have torn you apart
I know you've been saved from your own
But together we're strong
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're holding me
I'm feeling passionate
'Cause time takes what love steals
And deep in my heart I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do, I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're next to me
I'm feeling sensual

I know, I know that it's real...ooh
Whatever you want me to do....do, do,...ooh
'Cause time takes and love heals
Wherever we are, I know it's for real
I know, I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do baby, baby, baby
I will do darling, do it for you
Whatever you want me to be..yeah, I will be everything
Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
It's time that I'm free of a love that pleases me
Ooh, too easily, easily baby

// Missing You //

Every time I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
Since you've been gone away (missing you)
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all (missing you)
Since you've been gone away (missing you)
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)

There's a message that I'm sending out
Via telegraph to your soul
And if I can't breach this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all ...ow...(missing you)
Since you've been gone away (missing you)
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what my friends say (missing you)
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you.. I can't lie to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you...missing you
I ain't missing you, oh no
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
Every time I think of you, I always catch my breath

// On Silent Wings //

There was a time when I would have followed you
To the ends of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you
The love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams
Were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to...oh

You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings

I can see us in our dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers, they go unanswered
But we both know, we're just hanging on
Oh, I feel the shame
But I'll never know the reason why
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh it's just a memory

You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings

You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings

Silent wings...oh
Silent wings...oh

No more promises to break
Oh our love has slipped away
Silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wing
Silent wings ....oh
Never be the same again....silent wings, silent wings

// Thief Of Hearts //

Let me tell you about a man I knew
Yeah, I knew him all too well
Huh, my attitude has always been
You can have me for tonight, not for tomorrow
It's gonna cost you plenty yeah
More than you can afford or you can borrow
Well I can make'm fall in love
Just as easy as I pick their pockets hey
And when I've done the deed
I jump on a freight train and make my getaway

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine

Yeah, I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes
Did something strange to me
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride
There was a fork in the street
Well I didn't mean to fall in love
Didn't practice the rules that I've been taught
You never get involved, never drop your defences
But this time I got caught

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine

Feel so good I want more, it should be against the law yeah
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Aahhhhh, thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts, I've been a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts
Been a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Thief of hearts

// In Your Wildest Dreams //

Oh baby, oh baby
The sun goes down and the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you, and the mad thing starts yeah

Ohho..yeah, never in your wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no
Never in your wildest dreams could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no

Oh baby, oh baby
The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking, people talking
I smell your skin, I feel you breathing
Don't let me go, not yet, not yet, not yet

Ohho..yeah, never in your wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams, oh..oh
Never in your wildest dreams did it ever get this easy
Never in your wildest dreams, oh

Oh baby, oh baby
The world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face, touch your eyes, your lips, space space
We've arrived at the place where they open the hearts
And fill them up with love, filled with love, filled with love
This one's pumping for you, as the mad thing starts

Never in your wild, never in your wild, ...ohh
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wild, never in your wild, ...ohh
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no
Never in your wildest dreams did it ever feel this easy
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no

[Antonio Banderas in Spanish:]
We've arrived at the place where they open the hearts and fill them up with love, filled with love, filled with love
This one's pumping for you

And the mad thing starts...ooh sacrifice
Never in your wildest dreams, did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no
Never in your wildest dreams can it ever feel this easy
Never in your wildest dreams, oh..oh

// Goldeneye //

See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath

Goldeneye I found his weakness
Goldeneye he'll do what I please
Goldeneye no time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees

You'll never know how I watched you
From the shadows as a child
You'll never know how it feels to be the one
Who's left behind
You'll never know the days, the nights,
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side

See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out

Goldeneye not lace or leather
Golden chains take him to the spot
Goldeneye I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see
What I've got

You'll never know how I watched you
From the shadows as a child
You'll never know how it feels to get so close
And be denied
It's a gold and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge it's a kiss, this time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my sights
With a goldeneye, golden, goldeneye
With a goldeneye, goldeneye

// Confidential //

You don't need to give me reasons
I'll understand
Somethings are best kept secret
And you've done all you can
I want no recompense
Just as much as you can give of yourself
If that makes sense

I'll keep it confidential
Each secret confidential
It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential
Between you and me

Go on tell me that you love me
Show me you dare
We may not venture out in public
At least I know, you care
It can't be guaranteed
Just give me what you can of yourself
That's all I need

I'll keep it confidential
Each secret confidential
It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential
Between you and me

No one will know
Who I am
I think it's possible only to love
(Each secret... confidential)
You play such silly games
But if everyone knew about us
I'd feel no shame

I'll keep it confidential
Each secret confidential
It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential
Between you and me

Each secret..confidential...oh yeah
Each secret..confidential

// Something Beautiful Remains //

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

We're living in world, stars and dust
Between heaven 'n all that surrounds us
We're travellers here, spirits passing through
And the love we give, is all that will endure
Hey now, what we had is gone
But I still remember you
Just like a rose after the rain
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

Now the darkness falls
Sun's going down
One by one, the stars are coming out
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand
One day ends, a new day must begin
Hey now, though we are apart
You're forever in my dreams
Hey now, love is lost again
(What u gonna do about it
What u gonna say)
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

And you wonder sometimes how we carry on
When you've lost the love the knew
But it's alright, it's alright
To your own heart be true

Tears will leave no stains
Time will ease the pain
For every life that fades
Something beautiful remains

// All Kinds Of People //

There's a time for love and a time for healing
Can't go back and undo what's been done
The word about time is revealing
Just how far we've left this kingdom come

Hey hey we're finding our way
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Kiss of life and the hand of fate
Boy grow's up into his father's son
And he loves to love, been taught to hate
To carry on the way it had been done

All that lasts is destiny and
Maybe someday we can put the cast away
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Put your fear away, find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Underneath a broken sky
Love can heal when it's sad
In a moment, things can change
One look behind and it's never the same

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world yeah
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world
Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Put your fear away, find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world...yeah

Underneath a broken sky
In a moment, things can change....never the same

// Unfinished Sympathy //

Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby

I know that I've been mad in love before
But how I can be with you

You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've gotten so much more

Baby
Baby

The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching

You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've gotten so much more

Oh yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part

Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part

You really hurt me, baby
You really hurt me, baby
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
I'm every missing every part

// Dancing In My Dreams //

I've been running from the truth
I've been running since my youth
Tired of running
I will stand here till you see
I am you and you are me
Tired of running

There really is no difference
When you look beneath the skin
Someday I know we'll go beyond
This world we're living in

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing....ummmm
Dancing in my dreams

There's no hiding in the dark
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder
Just as long as we believe
The truth will set us free it's getting louder
All that really matters is the light in your face
In you I see the longing of the whole human race

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Dancing in my dreams

All along the story goes
Or it's the passing of the torch...ummmm
With one small pass it all begins
Then there are millions more, millions more

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing...ohhhh
Dancing in my dreams
Ohhhh...uhhhh dancing in my dreams
