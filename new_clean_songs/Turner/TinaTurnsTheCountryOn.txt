// Bayou Song //

Just another Louisiana morning
Bayou rain falling without warning
Babies crying
Windows dirty
I can't see out them
Sitting and smoking and thinking about it
Lord I'm so tired
I've been out working in the long cold night
I'm too tired to eat, to hungry to fight
Working for the man as hard as I can
Trying to make a living in this bayou land

Good Lord what kind of life is this for my baby
It's bad enough I got to suffer it myself
Take our love
Takes us from this bayou country
Let the bayou bog starve by itself

Just another Louisiana afternoon
Drinking homemade liquor 2 ounce smooth
Till you hanging
Don't talk much 'cause the pain is crazy
Times are hard things are hazy
Lord I'm so tired
To make it in this town you got to work all over
When I get home I start all over
Half dead by the end of the night
But it's what I got to do to get my man a good life

Good Lord what kind of life is this for my baby
It's bad enough I got to suffer it myself
Take our love
Takes us from this bayou country
Let the bayou bog starve by itself

Let the bayou bog drink itself to hell

// Help Me Make It Through The Night //

Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft against your skin
Like the shadow on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
'Til the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night

// Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You //

Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.

Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave.

I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster, too
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

// If You Love Me (Let Me Know) //

You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I'd filled my world around you
Yeah and I prayed you loved enough of me to stay

If you love me let me know
If you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be
If you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello it's good to see you
Any time I turn around and find you there

It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you'll have whatever's mine to give you
Yeah but a love affair for one it can never be

If you love me let me know
If you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be
If you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you

Take the chains away that keep me loving you

// He Belongs To Me //

He's got everything He needs, He's an artist, He don't look back
He's got everything He needs, He's an artist, He don't look back
He can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black

You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything He sees
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything He sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole, down upon your knees

He never stumbles, He's got no place to fall
He never stumbles, He got no place to fall
He's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all

He wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before He speaks
He wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before He speaks
He's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique

Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween, buy her a trumpet and for Christmas, give her a drum

// Don't Talk Now //

Where I've been, you don't know. And what I've got, baby, it don't show
Now, I won't try to teach you how, don't talk now
Don't talk roads, don't talk sand. Don't talk dust, don't talk no man
Don't talk rules, don't talk vows, don't talk now

I don't wanna hear the same old song
And too many rights still make her wrong, baby
I know she can't hurt me less by talking more
She can't make good what was bad before

No, it's too late now for me to lie and I can't make a second try
I just came on back baby got to say good bye, good bye
Don't talk now, don't talk now. Don't talk now, don't talk now

// Long Long Time //

Love will abide, take things in stride
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time

Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory of a love that never was
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
'Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time

// I'm Moving On //

That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a roll
And keep movin' me on

Mister engineer take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
You're gonna ease my mind put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a trifling woman on my main line
'Cause I'm movin' you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice now you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on you stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on

// There'll Always Be Music //

A mother sings as she rocks her babies
Children sing the noted nursery rhymes
The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing
Music is as old as the time

As the farmer works the fields he sings a song
The songbirds in the trees sing along
And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees
Man's burdens are made lighter with a song

There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told
There'll always be music 'cause music is the voice of the song
There'll always be music

Rain makes rhythmic sounds when it's falling
There's music in a new born baby's cry
There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound
For that's the way a man expresses life

In heaven there's a choir of angels singing
We often heard about God's angel band
Music will live on when men on earth are gone
There'll still be music in that promised land

There'll always be music
