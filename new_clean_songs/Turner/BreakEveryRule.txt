// What You Get Is What You See //

Some boys just got the look of a Greek Adonis
An' some boys just try to talk you off your feet
Some boys think they're God's gift to woman
An' some boys just think they're sweet enough to eat
I change the habit of a lifetime
Don't even try
'Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing
You realize

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

Some guys just got lips that you can't help kissing
And some guys just got a smile you can't resist
Some guys just got to build a reputation
They just wanna add you to the list
You got a lot of physical attraction
I can't deny, but can you guarantee me satisfaction
While, I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, ooh

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

So, let me see your cards on the table
Before I buy
I always read the writing on the label
So, give me reason to believe
There's more to you than meets the eye

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

Ain't nothing more to it
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter at all
I don't want your kind of love
Ain't nothing else to it
I don't want your kind of love, ooh
What you get is what you see

// Two People //

Two people living on the edge of life
Are people running out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can't let go

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people living in the way we do
Are people trying to keep a love anew
What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feeling fit

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

I'll come running to your rescue
You got to stand by me
There's a lot of love between us
And we should never let go, oh

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever

// Till The Right Man Comes Along //

It's time to face the music
Tonight, I came to use it
You never know
Who you're going to meet in here
I thought I'd never find him
The dark an' handsome kind
I used to dream of
And now you're standing there
Though you're looking good to me
It doesn't mean that you can do as you please
No no no no

Oh baby, you're the best thing in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)
Oh baby, you're my best bet here tonight
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
I've got no good reason to believe we'll last for long
But that's good enough for me
Until the right man comes along

I've waited for a lover
The kind who'll stay forever
You look to me
Like the sort of man I need
It's not the best scenario
But now I've found you
I'm not letting you go
Oh

Oh baby, you're the best find in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)
Oh baby, you're my best bet here tonight
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
For the perfect guy, maybe I should be holding on
And with you I could, until the right man
Until the right man comes along

Oh baby, you're the best find in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)
Oh baby, you're my best bet here tonight
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
For the perfect guy, maybe I should be holding on
And with you I could, until the right man
Until the right man comes along

Until the right man comes along, comes along
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
Baby, you're the best, say you're the best
You're the best thing in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)

// Afterglow //

I need you here beside me
To chase the night away
I need your love to guide me
Safe through another day
I lie and watch the lights go down
Say goodnight to another town
And though it hurts
To be alone
I have my thoughts of you
To keep me warm

In the afterglow of your love
Dreams all I'm guilty of
Everyday I'm playing tough
But read my mind
If you could see me now
Living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
The me that only you would know
Still burning in the afterglow

When the beat of the drum has faded
The show comes to an end
The stage is clear and loaded
And the highway calls again
I stand and watch the lights go down

In the afterglow of your love
Dreams all I'm guilty of
Everyday I'm playing tough
But read my mind
If you could see me now
Living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
The me that only you would know
Still burning in the afterglow

Hmm hmm
Stay with me right to the end
Hmm hmm
'Til I can hold you again
Hmm hmm hmm

If you could see me now
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglow
(If you could see me now)
Oh I'm just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now

Still burning 
Still burning 
Still burning 
(If you could see me now)
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglow

// Girls //

Girls, we come and we go
We kiss, come and we go
Like a breeze brushing your cheek
Like pain, like the tears on a face
Girls

Girls, we come and we go
Like spirits, we vanish at dawn
My heart suspended in time
Like you, vanish like tears in the rain

Girls, we take our love away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls, pretending to break down and cry
Girls, whispering wind
Why do we give it away?
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember, so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely, how lonely
Could feel

Girls, we come and we go
We kiss, come and we go
Like spirits brushing your cheek
Ooo, like pain, like the tears on a face

Girls, we take our love away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls, pretending to break down and cry
Girls, whispering wind
What are we giving away?
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember, so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely, how lonely
Could feel
Could feel
Could feel

Yeah, yeah, yeah

// Back Where You Started //

Baby, tell me what you're trying to prove
Playing games with my heart
Hey, now listen
I ain't got to take one more night
You're the one who broke the rules
An' I'm the one who played the fool
Now you're trying to tell me, it's alright
You should have known better than to hurt a friend
You'll never get another chance again

You'll be back where you started
I know you won't admit it
But you're brokenhearted
You'll be back where you started
You think it's going to be easy
But it just gets harder, harder, harder, yeah

You had a way with words
One look an' I was under your spell
I didn't know, should I stay, should I run
You can't deny that you told me lies
Love 'em an' leave 'em baby, that's your style
I'm not afraid to take life as it comes
You play with fire, guess you'll never learn
You messed with me baby, going to get burned

You'll be back where you started
An' you know how it feels
When you've been discarded
You'll be back where you started
But you think you got it made
But it won't get you far
No it won't get you far
You'll be back where you started

Who's going to help ya, throw you a lifeline?
I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time
You took your one chance an' let it slip away
You never going to let it settle down
The river's gone now all over the town

You'll be back where you started
I know you won't admit it
But you're brokenhearted
You'll be back where you started
You think it's going to be easy
But it just gets harder

You'll be back where you started
An' you know how it feels
When you've been discarded
You'll be back where you started
You'll be back where you started
You'll be back where you started
You'll be back where you started

// Break Every Rule //

Every road that I walk
Every single flight I ever take
Though I'm thousands of miles away
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you
I've been all around this world
I've been in far too many states
But I'm under your spell
I've made my mistakes, oh you can probably tell

You're every dream that I dream
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen
I'm always singing your praises
Counting the days away
I would be your slave
I'd even be your fool
I'm so in love with you
I'm in love with you baby
I'm going to break every rule

I hope you can forgive
Every white lie, I'm forced to tell
They say that every thing's fair in love and in war
And I'm not above cheating for you
One night I'll catch you off your guard
And you'll finally fall so hard
Strategically speaking, I'm already beaten
I'll surrender to you

You're every dream that I dream
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen
I'm always singing your praises
Counting the days away
I would be your slave
I'd even be your fool
I'm so in love with you
I'm in love with you baby
I'm going to break every rule

// Overnight Sensation //

Well, I guess I've been a long time
Working in the back line
Trying to make a song fit
When you know it never was mine

Two dollar high-heel shoes
And a honky tonk dress
In the rhythm and the soul reviews
I had a dream I guess, yeah yes
And I had to beat the stage fright
I had to cry all night
Trying to make a song fit
When you know it never was right
I said, "Girl, get up and
Get out of this mess

You're going to be an overnight sensation
Going to be an overnight success"

And all through the badlands
Rocking on the bandstands
It's so hard in the bar bands
When there's no one there who understands
Lady luck will pass you by
And she will never say yes

You're going to be an overnight sensation
Going to be an overnight
Going to be an overnight success

I used to be a sweet little
Rock 'n' roll singer
Chasing after fortune and fame
What's your story?
What's your payola?
Me, I'm in the music game

Well I guess I've been a long time
Working in a back line
I'm trying to make a song fit
I know it never was mine

Eh, what can I tell you?
I made a break I guess
And now I'm an overnight sensation
Over, overnight
Say I'm an overnight sensation

Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight
Over, overnight sensation
Over, overnight
Over, overnight sensation
Yeah, yeah, yeah

// Paradise Is Here //

You say you want to live some
Move out into the fast lane
You say you need excitement
To make you come alive
Some place a million miles from
The shadows that surround you
I look for your attention
You're lost out in the future
Where lovers ask no questions
And shadows never fall
Some pilgrim bound for paradise
No compromise

The paradise is here
It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not some place out there
Tonight I need your love
Don't talk about tomorrow

But right now, I need your loving
Right now, give it to me
Right now, I want your loving
Right now, now now now now

You talk about your new plans
To move on up the stairway
You dream about the high life
That's waiting for you there
A world of fame and fortune
S just around the corner
But I don't need no high life
To make me feel a woman
And I don't need to reach for
No castles in the sky
Just put your arms around me
Oh devour me

The paradise is here
It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not some place out there
Tonight I need your love
Don't talk about tomorrow

But right now, I need your loving
Right now, give it to me
Right now, I want your loving
Right now, now now now now

Oh I want your loving right now
Right now, right now
Oh
Right now
Oh, give your loving right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Give it to me
Right now, right now
Give your loving
Right now, right now
Oh

// I'll Be Thunder //

There'll be a storm one night
Then I'll fly to you for shelter
Soaked in welcome rain
Falling to forbidden arms

Too breathless
Too helpless
Too restless
To explain needing you

There'll be a storm one night
But you will find my place of hiding
We'll watch the lights like children
Leave the fortress hand in hand

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

There'll be a storm one night
And I will find no other rescue
Lost and far from home
Crying for some guiding light

Too breathless
Too helpless
Too restless
To explain needing you

There'll be a storm one night
The wind will drive me to your castle
And you'll ignite the fire
As if everything were planned

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
There will be storm one night
(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
There will be storm one night
(I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning)
You will find my place of hiding
Yeah, I will come to you, girl I will come to you

I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
I'll be thunder, you'll be lightning
And we'll collide, on dry land

No betrayal, no denial
No need to explain
We'll collide

// Don't Turn Around //

If you wanna leave I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darling maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go now but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me holding me tight
If you ever think about me just know that I'll be alright
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine

Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know I'll survive, sure I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you don't go, don't go, don't go

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

// Havin' A Party //

We're havin' a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music on the radio
Champagne is in the icebox
And the popcorn's on the table
And me and my baby
Are out here on the floor

So listen, Mister DJ
Keep those records playin'
'Cause I'm a-havin' such a good time
'Cause I'm dancin' with my baby

And don't forget "The Mashed Potato"
No other song will do

// Take Me To The River //

Wash me!

I don't know why I love you like I do
With all the changes I keep going through
Lost all my money and my happiness
And I haven't had the worst of it yet
I wanna know, tell me, tell me why
I love it still

Take me to the river
Wash me down
Yeah, drop me in the water
Back to my fishing ground

And I don't know why they treat me so bad
Think of all the good things that I've never had
Love is an ocean I won't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I wanna know, won't you tell me, tell me why
I love it still

C'mon, river
Wet me down
Yeah, dip me in the water
Back to my fishing ground

And hold me, squeeze me
Just love me, and tease me
Till I can't, till I can't
Take it no more

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the good things that I've never had
Love's an ocean I won't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I wanna know, you tell me, tell me why
I love it still

Take me to the river
And dip me in the water
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Yeah take me to the water
My fishing ground
Wash me, wet me
Squeeze me, and tease me

Washing me down
