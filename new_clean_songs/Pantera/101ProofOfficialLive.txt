// Cowboys From Hell //

Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel, 12 gauge,
Can't lock me in your cage

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen well my friend, you see
It's been slow down below,
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

// Cemetery Gates //

Reverend, reverend
Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me
Lost within our plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery

Reverend. He turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why

I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your

Well, I guess
You took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy
This love would end in rage

And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride was in my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound

I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own

And when she died
I should've cried
And spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates!
Gates! Gates!

// Walk //

Can't you see
I'm easily
Bothered by persistence
One step from lashing
Out at you

You want in
To get under my skin
Call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong?
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Run your mouth
When I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends
That sympathize

Can you hear
The violins
Playing your song?
Those same friends
Tell me your every word

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong?
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

No way, punk

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Walk on home, boy!

// Fucking Hostile //

Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way

[Chorus]
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile

We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god

[Chorus]

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger

I won't listen

[Chorus]

// This Love //

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

[Chorus]

No more head trips

// Strength Beyond Strength //

There is nothing. No education. No family life to open my arms to.
You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow.
I'll be broke in a gutter.
I know the opinion. A broken record. Fuck you and your college dream.
Fact is, we're stronger than all.
You're working for perfect bodies, perfect minds and perfect neighbors.
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets and I'm making a fortune.
You're muscle and gall. Naive at best. I'm bone, brain and cock. Deep down stronger than all.
A sad state of affairs. A crippled America. A pipe dream buttfucked.
Immune. Stronger than all.
A lament for a rookie officer, punk ass weak little lamb.
For the mob, truly, does rule at this particular time.
We've grown into a monster. An arrogant, explosive motherfuck.
Hard as a rock. Shut like a lock.
Finally, the president in submission.
He holds out his hand on your television and draws back a stump. It's too late for some.
Far too late.
No more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck.
Let him bust his own child. The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope.
The daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything.
Hail Kings. The new Kings. Stronger than all.
A simple process to legalize. There would not be a choice but to take our side.
Be there no question of certain strengths.
Know this intention. Forever stronger than all.

// Becoming //

A long time ago I never knew myself. Then the memory
Of shame birthed its gift.
No more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one.
Running from beatings, deflating. I'm becoming more
Than a man. More than you ever were. Driven and burning
To rise beyond Jesus.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands. Perhaps
Through death my life won't be so bad.
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you. Staring through
Your eyes. Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me,
To realize my saving grasp. I of suicide. I the unlord.

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

// 5 Minutes Alone //

I see you had your mind all made up you group of
Pitiful liars. Before I woke to face the day, your master
Plan transpired. - Something told me - this job had more to
Meet the eye. My song is not believed? My words some
What deceiving? Now I'm unwhole
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are. Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation. I ask you please just give us...
5 minutes alone
I read your eyes, your mind was made up. You took me for
A fool. You used complexion of my skin for a counter
Racist tool. - You can't burn me - I've spilled my guts out
In the past. Taken advantage of because you know where
I've come from. My past
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are. Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation. I ask you please just give us...
5 minutes alone

// I'm Broken //

I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins while loved ones
Mourn the day, the absence of our faces, living, laughing,
Eyes awake. Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for ones conclusion, the lifestyle won.
Such values you taught your son. That's how.

Look at me now. I'm broken.
Inherit my life.

One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life. Force fed
To make us heed. Inbred to sponge our bleed. Every
Warning, a leaking rubber, a poison apple for mingled
Blood. Too young for ones delusion the lifestyle cost
Venereal Mother embrace the loss. That's how

Look at you now. You're broken
Inherit your life.

// War Nerve //

Truly, fuck the world,
for all it's worth,
every inch of planet Earth,
fuck myself,
don't leave me out,
but don't get involved,
don't corner me

Inside, ulcer,
unjust bastards,
file out face first
Meet the lies and see what you are

[Pre]

It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break

[Chorus]

For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - Fuck you all

Expect the worse,
you bleeding heart,
but kill me first
before it starts,
yes my cock is getting hard,
we are born different after all

Invite mayhem,
produce weapons,
shoot out,
burn down
No CNN or media now

[Pre]
[Chorus]

All the money in the fucking world couldn't buy me one second of trust
or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
Fuck you all

Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
Apologies unacceptable now
A blistered revenge awaits in me
This is fucking loveless

Hate
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Hate

The Lord knows,
there's worse
Ignore, this curse
Hate

// Suicide Note Pt. II //

Out of my mind,
gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution, live and learn , rape and turn
Fret not family,
nor pre-judged army
This is for me,
and me only, cowards only
Try it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and it's lies and makes graves
Graves descending down

It's not worth the time to try, to replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing, fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
for weakness is a magnet - watch me do it

[Chorus]

Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it,
doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
when a mind's made up to go ahead and die?
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?

[Chorus]

// Sandblasted Skin //

Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore,
it's on sale at the fucking dollar store

Waste of time,
pantomime,
circus doll,
at the local mall
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Exterminate, it's all fake

Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast
Sandblast
It's getting old, old, old

// New Level //

Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

[Pre]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

[Chorus]
A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

[Pre]

[Chorus]

No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills

// Domination / Hollow //

[Domination:]

Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else
Left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see
The dawn of the day
And the writing
On the wall
Those words that stare
Into your soul
And to yourself
You will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination a now blacked heart
Is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails it's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail
Marks the demise of you life.
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
Till your end forcing you to bend

[Hollow:]

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like bothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...
No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now

He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God
He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend
He as hollow as I alone

// Where You Come From //

It's strange to be around again
Can't kill the bad disguise
I was asking for it all,
Being dragged down the road
Call it wisdom
call it ignorance

But it's still alive
And it's in me now
And it lives and breathes
I can't give a fuck

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From a bottle of whiskey
It's where you come from
(the south)

A remedy to the curse
On harder wares control
Look at what's around
But I just can't lie around
Feeling sorry for myself

But it's still alive
And it's in me now
And it lives and breathes
I could care less

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From the weight of whiskey
It's where you come from
It's where you come from

Bottle of Whiskey

I fell in front of my friends
I dropped out in front of the world
You call that supernatural?
It ain't

I've got a big mouth
And there's a life to live
From a bottle of whiskey
It's where (the south)

Black wings will weather your flight
For some there's no second time
Following paths of your life
I stepped off the mountain to the sky

Watch your ass now
It's where you come from
Why'd you settle down?
It's where you come from
Where you come from
Why'd you ask them?
It's where you come from

// I Can't Hide //

I've written about my inner wars,
But i could give a shit about right now,
Most of me is all strength
And all of me is at war with dope
But my eyes are clear in sight
My guts are blazing,
I might have a life

I can't hide, to erase, what I've done-
Last year, and three years before
It still takes assholes of all kinds
On that fact I am still clear,
(cause) I should know and now I do
I'm one of them
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
A man that stands his ground with strength

Last year, and years before
Can't hide myself
I won't try
It makes me strong
It makes me strong
It makes me strong

It blows away weakness
It blows away detachment
It blows away the depression inside
It blows away the mental withdrawal
It blows that shit away
