// Flint (For The Unemployed And Underpaid) //

It's the same outside
Driving to the riverside
I pretend to cry
Even if I cried alone

I forgot the start
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone

Since the first of June
Lost my job and lost my room
I pretend to try
Even if I tried alone

I forgot the part
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died

// All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace! //

All good thoughts in spite of righteousness
Is not the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness
Often not the state is advocation
If we form a power of recognition

Forget loss and perfect advocation
If it drops or stays in convocation
All we praise is all we want in commerce
All we praise is parties, foreign commerce
Entertain ideas of great communion
Shelter not materials in union
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce
That's the right solution!)

All good thoughts is not the act of doing
What we want but what we should improving
Properties, ideas, a woman's pleasure
Is empowered by love, a perfect measure!

// For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti //

2, 3, 4

I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one?
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you

I was dressed embarrassment
I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?
Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you

// Say Yes! To M!ch!gan! //

Demonstrate I was 
raised from the start 
By a priest and 
the maid on the part. 
Still know what 
to wear on my back: 
Michigan! 
Ponshewaing! 
Cadillac! 

If I ever meant to go away 
I was raised, I was reaised 
In the place, in the place. 
Still I often think of going back 
To the farms, to the farms 
Golden arms, golden arms 
start to remind me. 

If the lakes took 
the place of the sea. 
If the cars drove 
themselves, way to be! 
Opposite the trains moving in 
Rivers run interstate, Michigan! 

Still I never meant to go away 
I was raised, I was raised 
In the place, in the place. 
Still I often think of going back 
To the farms, to the farms 
Golden arms, golden arms. 
Tried to change the 
Made in Michigan 
I was raised, I was raised 
In the place, in the place, 
part to remind me

// The Upper Peninsula //

I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
I've seen my wife at the K-Mart
In strange ideas we live apart

I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
I drove all night to find my child
In strange ideas he's been revived

In strange ideas, in stranger times
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I lost my job, I lost my wife

// Holland //

All the time we spent in bed 
Counting miles before we set 
Fall in love and fall apart 
Things will end before they start 

Sleeping on Lake Michigan 
Factories and marching bands 
Lose our clothes in summer time 
Lose ourselves to lose our minds 
In the summer heat, I might

// Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!) //

Once a great place. Now a prison. 
All I can say. All I can do. 
People Mover: Bad Decision. 
From suburban. Now a prison. 
All I can say. All I can do. 

From the trembling walls. It's a great idea! 
Everything you want. It's a great idea! 

Once a great place. Now a prison. 
All I can say. All I can do.

// Romulus //

Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough 
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon

When my turn came 
I was ashamed
When my turn came 
I was ashamed

Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day 
Her Chevrolet broke down 
We prayed it never be fixed or be found 

We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 

When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriend somewhile 
She moved away quite far 
Our Grampa bought us a new VCR 

We watched it all night 
We grew up in spite of it 
We watched it all night 
We grew up in spite of it 

We saw her once last fall 
Our Grampa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care 
She smoked in her room and coloured her hair 

I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her 
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed
Of her

// Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie //

Oh Sleeping Bear! 
Ran to the top and got scared 
of what I could see. 

Oh Lamb of God! 
Tell us your perfect design 
and give us the rod. 

Oh Sturgeon Bay! 
Covered completely in sand 
And covered in sun. 

Oh Saint Marie! Give up 
the rocking boats drowned. 
The Captain is done

// They Also Mourn Who Do Not Wear Black (For The Homeless In Muskegon) //

If you happen to be educated 
Time it marches on, 
oh time it marches on. 
In the end there is a sacred show 
delivers every song, 
delivers every song. 

Mourning steps and 
mourning gallivants 
And mourning never shows, 
no mourning never slows. 
If the avatar reminds that it 
will never stand at all, 
will never stand as tall. 

Since the water made it, 
most to sail it, 
made it most to song, 
it made it most to song. 
For the politics are not political 
for what they stand, 
For not what they demand. 
Every senator and diplomat 
combines her certain part, 
A matter for the heart. 
Save yourself from recognition. 
selfless and quite song 
To better get along. 

(We love you. We Chose to. 
We made to. We love you.) 

If we concentrate and pull 
resources to the highest poll, 
To beat the highest pull, too. 
Ever will we conquer grief 
and find it faster to resolve 
the dead, to be absolved 
and fed, to restore. 
If the advantageous 
reprimand misgivings, 
We wont grow. 
We will not ever know. 
We will not! 
(Lift my life in healthy places!)

// Oh God, Where Are You Now? (In Pickeral Lake? Pigeon? Marquette? Mackinaw?) //

Oh God, hold me now 
Oh Lord, hold me now 
There's no other man who could raise the dead 
So do what you can to anoint my head 

Oh God, where are you now? 
Oh Lord, say somehow 
The devil is hard on my face again 
The world is a hundred to one again 

Would the righteous still remain? 
Would my body stay the same? 

Oh God, hold me now 
Oh God, touch me now 
There's no other man who could save the dead 
There's no other God to place our head 

Would the righteous still remain? 
Would my body stay the same? 

There's no other man who could raise the dead 
So do what you can to anoint my head 

Oh God, hold me now 
Oh Lord, touch me now

// Vito's Ordination Song //

I always knew you 
In your mothers arms 
I have called your name 
I've an idea 
Placed in your mind 
To be a better man 
I've made a crown for you 
Put it in your room 
And when the bride groom comes 
There will be noise 
There will be glad 
And a perfect bed

And when you write a poem 
I know the words, I know the sounds 
Before you write it down 
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes 
And the jacket too 
I always knew you 
In your mothers arms 
I have called you son 
I've made amends 
Between father and son 
Or if you haven't one

Rest in my arms 
Sleep in my bed 
There's a design 
To what I did and said

// Marching Band //

One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound, 
trumpet sound 
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near 
and I felt the trembling motion 
we ran out to see the future, from the ground 
from the ground 
from the ground 
from the ground 
people died and people risen everywhere 
We held hands and made a circle 
quietly from the ground 
quietly from the ground 
We returned and set the table, by the door

// Niagara Falls //

We had friends downstate
When we drove we went to Canada
If we were asked to stay
I was brave
I was brave
I was brave

From the top of the mountain
You could see
Lake Erie
Niagara Falls
From the top of the fountain
I could see farther than anyone

Driving through the line
We pretend we are from Africa
If we fall far behind
I am brave
I am brave
I am brave

// Pickerel Lake //

I wasn't willing
To fight on the floor
Throwing the chairs through the door
And I wasn't willing
To fight on the floor
Something to say to the poor

The storms in July
Took off the trees
Took off the place to be
The animals died
Once in a while
Once in a while

And I wasn't willing
To make up the bed
Folding the sheets to your head
And I wasn't willing
To say it again
Waiting for things to be

The storms in July
Took off the trees
Took off the place to be
The animals died
Once in a while
Once in a while

// Presidents And Magistrates //

A government has gone this far
A covenant prepared to part
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me

If I'm alone in saying, "yes"
I'll change my views and try my best
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me

Take it only if you boldly
Cannot take it
(Jumps and lonely)
Presidents and magistration
Spend on golf
And spring vacation
(Peace to me!
We are the holy ones!)

I always knew you
In your mothers arms
I have called your name
I have an idea

Placed in your mind
To be a better man
I've made a crown for you
Put it in your room

And when the bride groom comes
There will be noise
There will be glad
And a perfect bed

And when you write a poem
I know the words
I know the sounds
Before you write it down

Only wear your clothes
I wear them too
I wear your shoes
And your jacket too

I always knew you
In your mothers arms
I have called you son
I've made amends

Between father and son
Or if you haven't one
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed

There is a design
To what I did and said

Homecoming queen
Took the train
To Pickerel Lake

It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault

It's sold and bought
It's sold and bought
It's sold and bought
It's sold and bought

Take it in stride
Take it in stride
Take it in stride
Take it in stride

Take it in stride
Take it in stride
Take it in stride
Take it in stride

It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault

It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
