// Lo! How A Rose E'er Blooming //

Lo! How a rose e're blooming
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse's lineage coming
As those of old have sung

It came, a flowerth bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half-spent was the night

Isaiah twice foretold it
The rose I have in mind
And so then we behold it
The Virgin Mother kind

To show God's love aright
She bore to us a Savior
When half-spent was the night

// Get Behind Me, Santa! //

I know whatcha doing to me boy,
You move so fast like a psychopathic color TV,
With your Christmas bag and your jolly face,
And the reindeer stompin' all over the place

Take it easy, what ya gotta be so absurd?
You make it sound like Christmas is a four-letter word 
Its a fact of life whether you like or not,
So put your hands together and give it a shot

I hope that you take it to heart boy,
It's Christmas time, ain't no clowning around 
And if you think you got something to prove boy, 
Santa Claus is coming to town

I don't care about family and shopping malls, 
Candy canes or the carolers decking the halls 
I don't care about what you say Santa Claus 
You're a bad brother breaking into people's garage 
Jeez!

You got it wrong,
'Cause I'm just another regular guy,
Super powers and a penchant for the Yuletime
Is it a crime to give a little once in awhile,
I travel 'round the world trying to make people smile

I know that you take it too hard boy,
It's Christmas time, ain't no clowning around
And if you think you got something to prove boy,
Santa Claus is coming to town 

C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S

Christmastime, Christmastime,
Christmastime,
Magic of Christmas,
Christmas, Christmastime,
Christmastime,
Have a good time!

// Christmas In July //

If I missed my chance, I didn't even try
I'm not one to regret Christmas in July
If my timing is bad, like a fish on a bike,
Would you let me pretend: Christmas in July?

I'm not one to admit; I'm not one to fight,
Maybe I was wrong, or maybe I was right
Like when I went to school, drinking coffee at night,
And I did what I did; now I do what I like

Open the champagne, party and pensive
Your mother said it's very expensive
Do what you want to, don't even ask us
Paraguay, Boston, Philly, Damascus

Maybe its the snow, the endless winter nights
And the winter coat, the one you never liked 
But I'll take the sun and I'll take my kite,
Christmas on the beach, Christmas in July 
And I love my friends, even if they fight
Christmas in July, just to keep them quiet
And I love you too, I love you through the night
But now that you're away, Christmas isn't right

Don't take offenses; come to your senses, 
Your confidence is straddling fences

If I miss my chance, I didn't even try
I'm not one to regret Christmas in July

// Jupiter Winter //

Oh Father Christmas,
Come to us, come to us
Perfect and with us, 
Come to us, come to us

Oh Mother Mary,
Celebrate, celebrate
Brave sanctuary,
Come to us, come to us

Explorations end in Christ,
Decorations left behind,
Where will you go, where will you go,
where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all

Oh Christian winter,
Call to us, call to us
Jupiter Winter,
Regulus, Regulus

Oh star of wisdom,
Light of life, light of life
Casperous prism,
Bride of life, bride of life

Disappointment to be had,
Hold your temper too my friend,
Where will you go, where will you go, where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all

// Sister Winter //

Oh my friends I've
Begun to worry right
Where I should be grateful
I should be satisfied

Oh my heart I
Would clap and dance in place
With my friends I have so
Much pleasure to embrace

But my heart is
Returned to sister winter
But my heart is
As cold as ice

Oh my thoughts I
Return to summer time
When I kissed your ankle
I kissed you through the night

All my gifts I gave everything to you
Your strange imagination
You threw it all away

Now my heart is
Returned to sister winter
Now my heart is
As cold as ice

All my friends, I've
Returned to sister winter
All my friends, I
Apologise, apologise

All my friends, I've
Returned to sister winter
All my friends, I
Apologise, apologise

All my friends, I've
Returned to sister winter
All my friends, I
Apologise, apologise

La la la la la...

And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you a Happy Christmas

To wish you a Happy Christmas
To wish you a Happy Christmas
To wish you a Happy Christmas

// Star Of Wonder //

I call you
From the comet's cradle
I found you
Trembling by yourself
When the night falls
Lightly on your right-wing shoulder
Wonderful know-it-all
Slightly where the night gets colder

Oh, conscience,
Where will you carry me?
I found you
Star of terrifying effigies
When the night falls
I carry myself to the fortress
Of your glorious cost
Oh, I may seek your fortress

When the night falls
We see the star of wonder
Wonderful night falls
We see you
We see you

I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to the yard
I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to my heart

// Holy, Holy, Holy //

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning 
our song shall rise to thee
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
Merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, 
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity

Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide thee,
Though the eye of sinful man 
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy; 
There is none beside thee,
Perfect in power 
Perfect in power
In love, and purity

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise thy Name, in 
Earth, and sky, and sea
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
There is none beside thee,
God in three Persons, 
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity
