Album: Curiosity

// Picture //

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

Say it in a whisper
That baby it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say, oh just say when

Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh baby, it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

Darling just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh...just say when

Two different worlds
I thought they'd keep us apart
I'm ignoring my head
Follow my heart

Oh you pick the day, darling
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait
Cause I just gotta see you again
So, don't ask. No. Just say when

You name the day and I will pick the city
(Just say when)
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh oh oh

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

// Talk To Me //

Every morning as I go walking by
I feel you looking, that's why I take my time
Oh oh, yeah

I can see what you wanna do to me
You can feel it, something's gonna break
Well, I'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

When he's singing his song
While all the young girls sigh
And we'll be wearing those things
That make a grown man cry
Oh oh, yeah

I can see what you wanna do to me
You can feel it, something's gonna break
Well, I'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart
Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start

When it's love like that and you look like that

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart
Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?

// Just A Step Away //

In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

It's the beating of your heart
It's the tear I have to hide
It's the sound of your guitar
It's the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
I'll keep my arms open wide
I'll be the one who loves you
I'll be right there by your side

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

I'll never let you down (I'll never let you down)
And I'll never go away (And I'll never go away)
And if you're ever feeling down (And if you're ever feeling down)
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step away

I'll never let you down
And I'll never go away
And if you're ever feeling down
I'm just a step, just a step, just a step away

In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
It's the way I feel inside

// Both Sides Now //

Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

Now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads
They say I've changed
Well something's lost and something's gained in living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

I really don't know life at all
