// Andalucia //

Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer, closer and nearer
Then again
Needing you, taking you, keeping you, leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)

I'll be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away
Andalucia, Castles and Christians
Andalucia come to stay
You were lost, once before, on a day much like this
When you'd made up your mind not to come
I couldn't persuade you or wait till tomorrow
Or pass the time
Or pass the time
Love you...

// Alabaster //

Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on

Night and the stars that hung all around us
Light the way to your door
Won't you pour me a glass of pure alabaster
Come, sit down by the fire

Days are growing short
Nights are growing longer
Gotta get much stronger
To make it through

True are these hearts that burn luminescent
Begging to invite you inside
Wide are the arms that long to hold you tight
In this sleepy embrace

Days are growing short
Nights are growing longer
You gotta get much stronger
To make it through

Night and the stars that hung all around us
Light the way to your door

Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on

// Greenwine //

I had nothing to say on Christmas Day
When you threw all your clothes on the floor
When you burned your hair and you knocked over the chair
I just tried to stay out of your way

When you fell asleep with blood on your teeth
I just got into my car and drove away
Listen to me butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
But it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

Where the state highway starts, I stopped my car
I got out and stared up at the stars
And as meteors died and shot across the sky
I just thought about your sad shining eyes

When I went back for my clothes when the sun finally rose
Oh and you were still passed out on the floor
Listen to me butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
But it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

// Christmas In April //

I wanted to hold you and keep you with me, this year
You're my darling and I want you near
I wanted to whisper sweet words of comfort in your ear
No more sorrow and no more fear

Oh, my love
When will we know
If we can meet under the mistletoe?

And I'm writing this song about Christmas in April this year
So I'm not sure what to think about that
And I'm hoping these words don't ring so hollow when you hear
You say "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"

Fits and starts, upset apple carts
Conspiring to keep us apart

I wanted to hold you and keep you with me, this year
You're my darling and I want you near
I'm hoping these words don't ring so hollow when you hear
You say "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"
And maybe all the winds blow away all our fears
Said "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"

// Souvenirs //

All the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded colors
All that's left to linger on

I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
Can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get these souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'
Always look the same to me

I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
Can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get these souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

// Night's Falling //

Night's falling
But you're not alone, no you're not alone
Take courage
That you're not alone, no you're not alone

When your words begin to crumble
Like the sidewalks all around this crummy neighborhood
From the chalky cliffs of Dover
I'd come over, I'd start over if I could

Night's falling
But you're not alone, no you're not alone
Take courage
That you're not alone, no you're not alone

Young swallow far from home
Some follow, some run

Take courage
'Cause night's falling
And you don't have a home
Take courage
'Cause night's falling
And you're on your own

// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
Oh, and all your Christmases be white"

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
Oh, and all your Christmases be white"

// Auld Lang Syne //

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Well we two have run about the braes
And pou'd the gowans fine
But we've wandered many a weary foot
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

We two have paddled in the burn
From morning sun till dine
But seas between us braid have roared
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

And there's a hand my trusty fiere
And gie's a hand o' thine
And we'll tak' a right gude-willie waught
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
