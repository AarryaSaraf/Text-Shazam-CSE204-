// Nice Guys Finish Last //

Nice guys finish last
You're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best
When you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up like piss going down the drain?

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

Living on command
You're shaking lots of hands
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory and you got no shame

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

Oh, nice guys finish last
(When you are the outcast)
(When you run out of gas)
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
(When you are the outcast)
(When you run out of gas)
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine, mhm!

Oh, nice guys finish last
(When you are the outcast)
(When you run out of gas)
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
(When you are the outcast)
(When you run out of gas)
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

// Hitchin' A Ride //

Hey, mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour? Say "oh no"
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
One, two, one, two, three, four!

Cold turkey's getting stale
Tonight, I'm eating crow
Fermented salmonella, poison oak, no
There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swelling up, I say
"One, two, one, two, three, four!"

Troubled times
You know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride

There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swelling up, I say... "Shit!"

Troubled times
You know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Say birthday boys, hey!)

// The Grouch //

I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun, and I hate everything
The world owes me, so fuck you
Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six-pack of apathy
Life's a bitch, and so am I
The world owes me, so fuck you

Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view

I've decomposed, yet my gut's getting fat
Oh my God, I'm turning out like my dad
I'm always rude, I've got a bad attitude
The world owes me, so fuck you
The wife's a nag, and the kid's fucking up
I don't have sex 'cause I can't get it up
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch
The world owes me, so fuck you

Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
('Til I grew up)

I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun, and I hate everything
The world owes me, so fuck you
Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six-pack of apathy
Life's a bitch, and so am I
The world owes me, so fuck you
The world owes me, so fuck you
The world owes me, so fuck you

// Redundant //

We're living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turning to contention
Like a production line going
Over and over and over, roller coaster

Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted, now I've
Wasted and faked it, ate it, now I hate it

'Cause I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

// Scattered //

Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future, too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you

Well, loose ends tied in knots leaving a lump down in my throat
I'm gagging on a souvenir
Live to fill another year
We'll drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Well, leaving myself open wide
Living out a sacrifice, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you

If you got no one
And I got no place to go
Would it be alright?
Could it be alright?

Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well

Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you

// All The Time //

All the time, every time I need it
What's the time? I said the time is right
Here's to me, let's find another reason
Down the hatch and a bad attitude, salud

Wasting time, wasting time down a bumfuck road
And I don't know where the hell it'll go
Heirlooms, huffing fumes, and I'm picking up the pace
And I'm gonna smash straight into a wall

All the time, New Year's resolutions
How soon that we forget
Doing time and loving every minute
Live it up on another let down, salud!

Promises, promises, it was all set in stone
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Sugar fix, dirty tricks, and a trick question
Guess I should've read between the lines

Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick
Having the time of my life
Watching the clock tick

All the time, where did all the time go?
It's too late to say goodnight
Time flies when you're having fun, yeah
Time's up when you work like a dog, salud

Yeah

// Worry Rock //

Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust fallen on our pride

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Where do we go from here
And what did you do with the directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road

A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

Another sentimental argument and bitter love

Fucked without a kiss again dragged it through the mud
Where do we go from here
And what did you do with the directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road

// Platypus (I Hate You) //

Your rise and fall back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It's time to quit 'cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground

No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear

'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!

I heard you're sick, sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck and now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know you're going to die

No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear

'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!

Dickhead, fuckface, cock-smoking, motherfucking
Asshole, dirty twat, a waste of semen, hope you die, hey!

Red eye, code blue, I'd like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down headfirst into the ground
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave

No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear

'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!

// Uptight //

I woke up on the wrong side of the floor
Made, made my way through the front door
Broke my engagement with myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch scratched on my belt
The future just ain't what it used to be

I got a new start on a dead end road
Peaked, peaked out on reaching new lows
Owed, I paid off all my debts to myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch scratched on my belt
The future's in my living room

Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

// Jinx //

One, two, three, four!

I fucked up again, it's all my fault
So turn me around and face the wall
And read me my rights and tell me I am wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull
A slap on the wrist, a stab in the back
Torture me, I've been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross and tell me you have won
I lost before I did any wrong

I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck
So keep your distance, it's rubbing off
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell
Or Earth with me tangled at your feet
You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love
So kiss it goodbye until death do we part
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud

I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you

// Haushinka //

Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name
I met her on the eve of my birthday
Did she know? (Did she know?)
Did she know before she went away?
Does she know? (Does she know?)
Does she know? But it's too damn late

This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
Now she's gone, now she's all gone

All I have now is a memory to date
A cheap hat and cigarettes and a peculiar name
I didn't know (I didn't know)
I didn't know before she went away
I know now (I know now)
I know now, but it's too damn late

This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
Now she's gone, now she's all gone

Will she ever find her way?
I'm too damn young to be too late, but am I?
Yet again, I'm kicking myself
And I'll be here in battle scars waiting for you
Waiting for you now

This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
This girl has flown far away (Now she's gone)
Now she's gone, now she's all gone

// Walking Alone //

Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time, I think I stuck my foot in my mouth
Thinking out loud and acting in vain
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground
Yet there's really no one left that's hanging around
Isn't that another familiar face?
Too drunk to figure out they're fading away

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone

// Reject //

Who the hell are you to tell me
What I am and what's my master plan?
What makes you think that it includes you?
Self-righteous wealth, stop flattering yourself

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone

You're not my type, not my type

What's the difference between you and me?
I do what I want, and you do what you're told
So listen and shut the hell up
It's no big deal, and I'll see you in hell

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up to your social sect
Making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone

You're not my type, not my type
Not my type, you're not my type

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Falling from grace, right on my face
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
So when the smoke clears, here I am
Say again, what?

// Take Back //

You pushed me once too far again
I want to break your fucking teeth
And stick a knife in the center of your back
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head
I fight dirty, just like your looks
Can't take, can't take, can't take any more

Take back
Take back
Take

The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue
An eye for an eye, a gun for a gun
Cold-cocked, and I'm taking back what's mine
Expect it when you're least expecting it
No loss of love, the smell of regret
Lights out, can't take, can't take any more

Take back
Take back
Take back
Take back

Shit!

// King For A Day //

It started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size four

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen?
Don't knock it until you've tried it

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

// Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) //

Fuck...

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

// Prosthetic Head //

I see you down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover
Plastic eyes lookin' through a numbskull
Self-effaced, what's his face, you've erased yourself, so shut up
You don't let up

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in my neck
You can smell it, but you can't see it
No explanation identified, 'cause

You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply

Hey you, where did you come from?
Got a head full of lead, you're an inbred bastard son
All dressed up, a red blooded a-mannequin
Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic
You're pathetic

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a severed severe pain in the neck
You can smell it, but you can't see it
No explanation identified, 'cause

You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply
You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply

I see you down on the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover

You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply
You don't know
You don't say that you got no reply
