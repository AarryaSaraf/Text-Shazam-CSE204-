// Forgetful //

Lately
You've been so forgetful
A kind of a stop and go forgetfulness
That bothers me

Kisses
I once had a netful
But you've been forgetful
And I'm never kissed
And it bothers me

Romance
Never any romance
No chance
And it bothers me

And someday
When you are regretful
You'll wish you had tried much less forgetfulness
You'll be upset

And forgetful
Won't be able
To forget

// The Song Is You //

I hear music when I look at you
A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I feel it start, then melt away

I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me
Why can't I let it go
Why can't I let you know
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet
The words are true
The song is you

// When I Fall In Love //

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before its begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
That's when I fall in love with you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
That's when I fall in love with you

// Deep In A Dream //

I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And I'm deep in a dream of you
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you
