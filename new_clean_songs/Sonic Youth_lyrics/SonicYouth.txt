// The Burning Spear //

[Thurston]

I'm not afraid to say I'm scared

In my bed I'm deep in prayer

I trust the speed I love the fear

The music comes

The burning spear

// I Dreamed I Dream //

[Kim]

Look before you leap, okay? 

Do you read me? 

May all your dreams come true 

He's standing by the door 

He's got something in his hands 

All the money's gone 

All the money's gone 

The days we spend, go on and on

Shift

Fucking youth

Working youth

May all your dreams come true 


A lot of people suffer 

From impotence 

All the money's gone

The days we spend go on and on 


Fucking youth 

Working youth 

Fucking youth 

Working youth

Fucking youth

Fucking youth

Working youth

[Lee]

You slept

Did I drift?

Do I dream? 

Do you read me? 

I'm not speaking 

Do you read me?

I dream


I dream


Sound today are you sound today

are you sound today?

Sound today are you sound today

are you sound today?

Today

These things don't happen

automatically

I dream

Edith moves each step

Fucking youth 

The days we spent go on and on

I dream

Do you read me?

// She Is Not Alone //

[Thurston]

She is not alone

She is not alone today


She is not alone

She is not alone today


She is not alone

She is not alone today


She is not alone


To... day

// I Don't Want To Push It //

[Thurston]

You gave your line

You fell in love

You feel the shadow

There's no more to borrow

There's no more to steal

And no more to feel

I know I know I know

I know I know I know

I know I know I know

You fell in line

You fell in jail

You feel in the shadow

To live in the light

To die in the night

I don't want to push it

I know I know I know

I know I know I know

I know I know I know
