// Gunpowder & Lead //

County road 233, under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ole me
I've got two miles 'til, he makes bail
And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

Well, it's half past ten, another six pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time

Hey! I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

His fist is big but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight well now he's got one
He ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead

Gunpowder and lead

Hey!

// Dry Town //

Well the road was hot and flat as a ruler

Good hundred miles between me and Missoula

That vinyl top wasn't gettin' no cooler

I stopped at a quickie sack

Well I figured I'd need about a sixth of Miller

And one of those things so I wouldn't spill 'er

I asked the girl if the beer was in the back

She said


It's a dry town

No beer, no liquor for miles around

I'd give a nickel for a sip or two

To wash me down

Outta this dry town


So I turn right around, no hesitation

Cursed the law for ruinin' the nation

Waved goodbye to the boy at the station

But she wouldn't go in gear


He said it sounds like your transmission

You need Bob, but he's gone fishin'

His day off, he gets a long way from here

Cause


It's a dry town

No beer, no liquor for miles around

I'd give a nickel for a sip or two

To wash me down

Outta this dry town


Well back home friends you can get a dose of

Something strong from your local grocer

So I walked down 'til I got a little closer

To a place called Happy Johns


He said I keep something here for colds and fevers

Down underneath where I usual leave her

Just last night I felt a cold coming on


It's a dry town

No beer, no liquor for miles around

I'd give a nickel for a sip or two

To wash me down

Outta this dry town

// Famous In A Small Town //

They say life is so much sweeter

Through the telephoto lens of fame

Around here you get just as much attention

Cheerin' at the high school football game


I dreamed of going to Nashville

Put my money down and placed my bet

But I just got the first buck of the season

I made the front page of the Turner "Town Gazette"


Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell

Every grandma, in law, ex girlfriend

Maybe knows you just a little too well

Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail

Hey words gonna get around

Everybody dies famous in a small town


Tyler and Casey broke up

It ended pretty quietly

We heard he was caught red-handed with her mama

That's just what they let us all believe


Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell

Every grandma, in law, ex girlfriend

Maybe knows you just a little too well

Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail

Hey words gonna get around

Everybody dies famous in a small town


Baby who

Needs their faces in a magazine

Me and you

We've been stars of the town since we were 17


Let's go on down to the quick stop

Wear your yellow shades

And I'll put on my tight jeans

And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber

And we'll let em point and stare in disbelief


Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell

Every grandma, in law, ex girlfriend

Maybe knows you just a little too well

Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail

Hey words gonna get around

Everybody dies famous in a small town

// Crazy Ex-Girlfriend //

It took me 5 bars, some 30 license plates

I saw her mustang

And my eyes filled up with rage

I brought my pistol but I ain't some kinda fool

So I walked right in barehanded

She was on his arm while he was playing pool

Just like I used to do

She kissed him while I got a beer

She didn't think I'd show up here

I'm a crazy ex girlfriend


I watched her for awhile but I didn't like her walk

She came across kinda cheap to me

But hey hows that my fault

She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch

Somebody tell that girl

To step up to that plate

I wanna Pitch

Little Bitch


Well those pretty girls can play their game

But their damn well gonna know my name

I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend


Well I started throwing things and

I scared folks half to death

I got up in his face and smelled whiskey on his breath

I Didn't give it a second thought to being thrown in jail

Well baby to a hammer everything looks like a nail

And I was mad as hell


Well those pretty girls they're all the same

But they're damn well gonna know my name

I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend


I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend

I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend

I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend

// Love Letters //

Love Letters on wet paper

Forgivers, no takers

An angel who never got wings

You find Jesus and it's too late

He's already closed the front gate

And the sign's flashing no vacancy


You've broken my heart for the last time

You promise the truth and you told lies

You've really made me believe

That love was supposed to be free


Love letters on wet paper

Forgivers, no takers

An angel who never got wings

You find Jesus and it's too late

He's already closed the front gate

And the signs flashing no vacancy


I'll never forget how he used to be

But I'm better off living with memories

I know that it's gonna hurt

But I don't think it gets any worse


And love letters on wet paper

Forgivers, no takers

An angel who never got wings

You find Jesus and it's too late

He's already closed the front gate

And the sign's flashing no vacancy


Yeah, my heart's flashing no vacancy

// Desperation //

Throw a dog a bone,

I'll take it if i have to

Go real fast like there's somewhere we can get to

What's the use of standing right there on the edge if there ain't nowhere to fall

What's the use in hanging on tight to the phone

If nobody might call

[Chorus:]

Desperation

There's danger in frustration

Complicated words slipping off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth

I'm still desperate for you


Tell it like a lie,

live it like a movie

Give a heart away like it don't mean nothing to me

What's the use in making all the plans that we made if you weren't gonna go

What's the use of slapping on a smile for a face if your eyes don't wanna show

[Repeat Chorus:]


Well it's too damn bad  you didn't have a chance to make me your best friend

You were too caught up in giving too much up and not doing what you should have been

[Repeat Chorus:]

// More Like Her //

She's beautiful in her simple little way

She don't have too much to say when she gets mad

She understands she don't let go of anything

Even when the pain gets really bad

Guess I should've been more like that


You had it all for a pretty little while

And some how you made me smile when I was sad

You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart

Then you realized you wanted what you had

I guess I should've been more like that


I should have held on to my pride

I should have never let you lie

I guess you got what you deserved

I guess I should've been more like her


Forgiving you, she's stronger than I am

You don't look much like a man from where I'm at

It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth

You love her and she loves you with all she has

I guess I should've been more like that


I should have held on to my pride

I should have never let you lie

I guess you got what you deserved

I guess I should've been more like her


She's beautiful in her simple, little way

// Down //

Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'

Strong man lived in a jackson hole
Took my heart and he broke my soul
Left a dark place in my chest
I sleep but I don't rest
I sleep but I don't rest

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'

Met a little boy in Baton Rouge
His eyes were clear and his heart was true
Made the boy's heart scream my name
But he didn't know the game
No he didn't know the game

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts your what I'm breakin'
Yeah...
Hey
You don't want to be standin' there
When the storm hits you won't have a prayer
My wind will blow you to your knees
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me

Oooo yeah yeah

So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'
Heart's what I'm breakin'

// Guilty In Here //

God knows I tried everything I could

To stay inside tonight

But that boy's like a sore in your mouth

That you just have to bite

This number one is shakin' hands

With numbers two and three

Is it guilty in here or is it just me


I made a point of not mixin'

Love and pleasure in my life

Daytime boys and nightime boys

Usually don't see eye to eye

But I've been on a roll of late

And they're all on their knees

Is it guilty in here or is just me


What became of all the boys

Who only want one thing

Will someone tell me what I'm doin' wrong


'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings

And the young ones are just too dumb

I don't think I have any more

Room underneath my thumb

Maybe after all the ends do justify the means

Is it guilty in here or is it just me

[Chorus]


'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings

And the young ones are just too dumb

I don't think I have any more

Room underneath my thumb

Maybe after all the ends do justify the means

Is it guilty in here or is it just me

Is it guilty in here, maybe it's just me

// Getting Ready //

Oh baby, I'm getting ready

I'm getting ready to let you go

My hands are shaking,

my heart's unsteady

Oh, how I once loved you so


I know all the magic's gone

Wish I had a magic wand

I would put a spell on you

You would sing it as I do


Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go


Oh baby, you're my drug

I was just your cigarette

I was nothing you could be proud of

I have lost my self respect

Self respect, self respect

I have lost my self respect


Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go


Oh baby baby, I got no traction

I've been waiting and waiting for your reaction

Sure I tried a new direction

I'm going to give myself a resurrection


I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,

I'm getting ready to let you go


I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready,

I'm getting ready to let you go

// Easy From Now On //

There he goes gone again

Same old story's gotta come to an end

Lovin' him was a one way street

But I'm gettin' off where the crossroads meet


It's a quarter moon in a ten cent town

Time for me to lay my heartaches down

Saturday night gonna make myself a name

Take a month of sundays to try and explain


It's gonna be easy to fill

The heart of a thirsty woman

Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man

And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky

It's gonna be easy

It's gonna be easy from now on


Raw as whip but clean as a bone

Soft to touch when you take me home

When the mornin' comes and it's time for me to leave

Don't worry 'bout me, I got a wild card up my sleeve


It's gonna be easy to fill

The heart of a thirsty woman

Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man

And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky

It's gonna be easy, It's gonna be easy

It's gonna be easy from now on

// Girl Like Me //

You don't need a girl like me 

I've got bruises you can't see 

And when the lights go out 

I won't be around 

You don't need a girl like me 


You can't have a heart like mine 

But you can hold it for a while 

and when the lights go out 

I won't be around 

You can't have a heart like mine 


There's a rule that goes unwritten 

And I break it from time to time 

If you're fool enough to listen 

Then I'm fool enough to lie 


That's the kind of girl I am 

I take off before I land 

And even though you think you can 

You can't change the way I am 


Cause the rule remains unwritten 

I still break it from time to time 

If you're fool enough to listen 

Then I'm fool enough to lie 


You can't change the way I am 

You don't need a girl like me

// I Just Really Miss You //

There's a dark cloud hanging over my heart

I can't see where it ends, or where it starts.

I should get over you, but baby, it's so hard,

with this dark cloud hanging over my heart.


There's a sad song ringing in my head.      

Baby, it's been here ever since you left.

I should be moving along how far would I get

with this sad song ringing in my head.

[Chorus:]

I just really miss you, I just really miss you,

There's a life I can't ask you to leave.

I just really miss you, right now I kinda want to. 

The closest that you'll ever be to me

is free.


There's a hard wind blowing through this town.

And nothing left to hold is pushing me down.

It blows over you and me without a sound.

There's a hard wind blowing through this town.

[Chorus:]

I just really miss you, I just really miss you,

There's a life I can't ask you to leave.

I just really miss you, right now I kinda need to.

The closest that you'll ever be to me

is free.


Now it's one more night at the upside down,

it's ten steps in, and hundred miles back out.

[Chorus:]

I just really miss you, I just really miss you,

There's a life I can't ask you to leave.

I just really miss you, right now I kinda need to.

The closest that you'll ever be to me

is free.


There's a dark cloud hanging over my heart.....
