Album: OtherSongs

// Champion //

Here's to Nowhere Arizona you don't know how bad I owe ya
Didn't know a soul all summer long so my best friends became these songs I write
Stayed up all night

Here's to Mister Leather Jacket told me that I'd never hack it
Every time you did me wrong just put more country in these songs I write
They're gettin' me by

So I'd do it all again
Everything I had to lose to win
Cos every time I think my world might end
It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Champion
Champion

Heres' to sacrificing mem'ries things I've missed my best friend's wedding
Night that my nephew was born tears I poured into these songs I write
I've paid a price for this life

And I'd do it all again
Everything I had to lose to win
Cos every time I think my world might end
It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Champion
Champion

To everything that went all wrong
It only put more country in my songs

It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Look at where we are tonight
Champion
Champion
Champion

// Drunk (And I Don't Wanna Go Home) //

I've got some money in my pocket
Got some trouble on my tail
I can hear the dives a-knocking
Guess I'm heading off the rails
Singing ooh ooh ooh ooh

So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry I'll be fine
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

Yeah

We're in the bathroom getting chatty
There's a line out in the hall
Tryin'to be my Sugar Daddy
Getting' handsy in the stall
Singin'-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You like my gin n' tonic kisses
'Cause you know they taste so sweet
And I know you've got your missus

// Dumb Blonde //

Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
Its stormy wheater an' had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
Its stormy wheater an' had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

// Fooled Around And Fell In Love //

I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
And I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
Yes I did, yes I did
I fooled around and fell in love
Fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the grass got greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
You know I did, I
Fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

I got to tell ya
Ooh baby, I need ya
Don't make me wait
Ooh baby, I need ya
I fooled around, I fooled around

Free on my own, that's the way I used to be, oh
But since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me

Fooled around and fell in love
It's got a hold on me now
Fooled around and fell in love
I can't let go of you, baby
Fooled around and fell in love
Oh, I can't stop loving you now
Fooled around and fell in love

Hey!
I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
Yes I did, yes I did
I fooled around, I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around, I fooled around
I did it, I did it, I did it
I fooled around and fell in love
Oooh, ohhh
Ahhh

// I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal (But I'm Gonna Be A Diamond Someday) //

Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond someday
I'm gon' grow and glow till I'm so blue, pure, perfect
And put a smile on everybody's face
I'm gonna kneel and pray every day
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, oh, Lord
But I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the very best way to walk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to talk
And I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
Till I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
Hey, I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age
And I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day
Alright

Now I'm just an old chunk of coal
Ooh, and I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gon' grow and glow till I'm so blue, pure, perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
I'm a-gonna kneel and pray every day
Lest I should become vain along the way
Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal, oh, Lord
And I'm gonna be a diamond some day

Yeah, I'm gonna be the cotton picking' rage of the age
Yeah, I'm a-gonna be a diamond some day
Here we go

// I'm Movin' On //

That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama down in Tennessee
So keep me movin' on, keep me rollin' along
Shovel the coal, let this rattle a roll
And keep me movin' on

Mister engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep me movin' on, keep me rollin' along
You're gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep me rollin' on

I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For no trifling woman on my main line
'Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
Well I've warned you twice and now you settle the price
And now I'm movin' on

Some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
I'm movin' on, you stayed away too long
Well I'm through with you, with your bad and your blues
I'll keep a movin' on

// Jack Daniels //

Daddy always said he was wrong for me
And in the end he'd only bring me misery
I tried and tried to turn away
But something bout him makes me stay
The only man who's ever knocked me to my knees
The only man who's ever set my spirit free

He was born and raised in Lynchburg, Tennessee
His daddy owns a big distillery
He's an old time whiskey drinker
When I'm with him I get meaner
And momma says he's ruined my destiny
He sure has made a women out of me

I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
He's the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please
He always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again

I fell in love with Jack Daniels again
He's the best kind of lover that there is
I can have him when I please
He always satisfies my needs
He takes me back no matter where I've been
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again

Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been
That didn't do me wrong

Jack Daniels if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain, its drivin' me insane
Since my baby's gone

// Lie //

They say I'm there perfect girl
The kind you take to mama the kind you cant ignore

& I find your datin some girl named stacey
When will this dream come to life

Oh, when ya tell me that you want me 
Tell me that you need me baby
Cause I been sittin here waitin, waitin for you to come save me
Tell me does it feel right under this porch light, look me in the eye
Tell me that you want me even if ya have to even if ya have to lie

Take back all my pennies from that wishing well
Oh, why cant we be Will and Kate? 
I know that we could be that great

Oh, maybe tonight
You'll tell me that you want me 
Tell me that you need me baby
Cause I been sitting here waiting 
Waiting for you to come save me

Waitin for you to come save me

Even if ya have to lie
Lieee

// Lyin' Here //

I love you more than you'll ever know
And I'll miss you more than I care to show
I'll get better at pretending nothing's wrong
Its easy when you're always all alone
But lately I see leaving in your eyes
So nothing you say will come as a surprise
You don't even have to try to be sincere
Just go on and leave me lyin' here

And I'll tell my heart you didn't cause it to break
And I'll tell my mind that I'm the one who made the mistakes
And I'll tell my eyes they don't even have to cry one tear
Just go on and leave my lyin' here

So go on and find you someone new
I'll make sure that I end up the fool
Maybe someday I'll begin to make it clear
You're the one who left me lyin' here

And I'll tell my heart you didn't cause it to break
And I'll tell my mind that I'm the one who made the mistakes
And I'll tell my eyes they don't even have to cry one tear
Just go on and leave my lyin' here

Just walk away dear and leave me lyin' here

// My Father's Gun //

From this day on, I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down, below the southern land
What I'd do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
Wear the color of the grey's and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die, I'll wear my father's gun

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend

As soon as this is over, we'll go home
Plant the seeds of justice in our bones
We'll watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter there when the bells of freedom ring

I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend
Oh, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
Mmm, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
(Oh, woah)
Slip us a rope and sail around the bend

// Nobody's Used To Be //

I'm gonna drink till I feel pretty
I'm gonna laugh till you get mad
I'm gonna dance with three more strangers
Till you get over what you had

[Chorus]
I can feel you starin at me
And I just love good irony
The only shot you got's one more tequila
Cause I aint nobody's used to be

Its gettin late
A little lonely
And what you're thinkin's all to clear
Lucky for you I've had too many
I'm just drunk enough to leave you here

[Chorus]
I can feel you starin at me
And I just love good irony
The only shot you got's one more Jack Daniels
Cause I aint nobody's used to be

You can stop anticipatin 
Just go home I know she's waitin
And I know you'll be wishin it was me
Honey I ain't nobody's used to be

// Roots And Wings //

I got red dirt stains
On my boots and jeans
Calloused fingers
From my guitar strings
Wild like the wind
In the tall pine trees
I got roots
And I got wings

I raise my glass
On a Saturday night
I thank the Lord above
On my Sunday drive
For Daddy's hands
And Mama's dreams
He gave me roots
She gave me wings

He said run on love
And run on life
And plant some seeds 
Until you're tired
Don't take anything at all for granted

She said raise your hands 
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever wanna be

He said run on love
And run on life 
And plant some seeds 
And take your time
Don't take anything at all for granted

She said raise your hands 
And raise your babies
Be yourself
And never change it
Be everything you ever wanna be

I saddle up
When I get down
Sing every night
In a different town
And I've got a man who wears my ring
And I got roots
And I got wings
Yeah I got roots
I got wings

// Run Daddy Run //

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

All the songs you used to sing to me
Would rock birds to sleep
I need you now so please somehow
Put rockets on your feet

Oh oh oh oh

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Saw that dark cloud coming from a million miles away.
Oh how I've dreaded this God forsaken day.

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Mama's been crying in the kitchen
Sister's been afraid of the dark.
I've been gathering the pieces of all these shattered hearts.
And I don't care where you go to
And I don't care where you land
But just get out of there daddy as fast as you can

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
Like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run.

Run Daddy run, run daddy run.
Run Daddy run, run daddy run.

// Scars //

Some are deep, some are not
Some never hurt at all, some hurt a lot
Some are there from our mistakes
Some are all that's left to show of the choices that we've made

Even the ones too small to notice,
are there to remind us who we are
Even if the world could look inside us
They might miss the blemish on our hearts
These scars

I've got mine, you've got yours
I've lived long enough to know not to hide them any more
'Cause we've had time, and time can heal
If they could change the way we look,
they can change the way we feel

I understand as well as you do
Sometimes a touch can go too far
Love was never meant to be that easy
And some don't just disappear in the dark
These scars

Pain that I remember, is the pain that makes me stronger
I've had to look at life that way
I've learned to rise above it, to keep from going under
Well I take it step by step, day by day

I'm not ashamed of what you see,
'cause every single scar has become a part of me
And all I know, is here and now,
yesterday's gone, but we made it through somehow

Looking back I'm glad I took my chances,
'cause they were worth at least enough to leave a mark
Baby I'm not sure where we're going,
but it means a lot to know just where we'll start
With these scars

Some are deep, some are not
Some never hurt at all, some hurt a lot...

// Somebody Else //

Highway 65 sure sounds kinda nice
I feel like drivin' somewhere far away
Got the top rolled down, radio up loud
Playin Willie and Old Hank

Well I don't really have a certain destination
I'll just fill the gas tank up and use my imagination

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

Sometimes we're afraid to change, scared of what tomorrow brings
Same routine every day
If you never stop and listen, you don't know what you'll be missin'
Don't let your life slip away

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about.
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

I wanna feel my freedom blowin' through my hair
Throw my troubles to the wind and scream out I don't care
I'm tired of bein' down and out cause that ain't what life should be about
I can feel the load gettin' lighter with every mile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

Stay up all night and sleep all day and wake up with a smile
I wanna be somebody else for a little while

// Sweet By And By //

Pick a switch, read the bible.
Hunt fish for survival.
Plant a seed, watch it grow.
Learn to trust which way the wind blows.
Let your mama know you love her, you will never have another.

Daddy, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Family's the light that guides us, blessed be the ties that bind us.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.

Tell the truth, earn your dollar.
Let not your heart asunder.
Save yourself, believe in faith.
Good things come to those who wait.
Let your daddy know you love him, you will never have another.

Mama, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Family's the light that guides us, blessed be the ties that bind us.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.

Daddy, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Mama, I have not forgotten lessons learned under the light of a southern, starry sky.
Sweet by and by, sweet by and by.

// Take It Out On Me //

These are the last words that I'll say to you
You know damn well what brought it on
I can't believe I've been a silly fool
To let it go on this long

You never let life get you down
'Cause every single time
You take it out on me

You kick and scream your dyin' love for me
Well, you don't win love in a fight
The place you really need some victory
Is by yourself alone at night

I left my picture on the bed
So someone could be right
Take it out on me

Take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

You treated me like I was second hand
Somehow I always caught the blame
You'll never guess what I've been catchin' now
A better man with a better name

You're left out in the rain again
You can walk home in my shoes
Take it out on me

Ooh, take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

Ooh, take it out on me
Or better still, you could
Take it out on the passenger seat
Where I used to be

I'm washing my hands clean
'Cause that's what you need
Take it out on me

Take it out on me

// They've Closed Down The Honky Tonks //

No bartenders
No guitars with B-Benders
No two-steppin' shuffles
No shiny belt buckles
No sawdust in sight
No cold Lone Star Light
Well, they've mopped all the floors
Locked all the doors
And turned out the lights

Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks
And now my world ain't turning
The jukebox ran out of change
And the neon lights ain't buzzing
There ain't nothin' sadder
Than covering Haggard
And nobody singing along
Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks

There's no Broken Spoke
Dim lights or thick smoke
No more rowdy and reckless
No more Billy Bob's Texas
No barstool backsliding
No Gilley's bull riding
No more last call
No boots in Gruene Hall
Damn, that ain't right

They've closed down the honky tonks
And now my world ain't turning
The jukebox ran out of change
And the neon lights ain't buzzing
There ain't nothin' sadder
Than covering Haggard
And nobody singing along
Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks

Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks

// Two Of A Crime //

Red rosé on painted lips.
Putting on Chanel, packing parliaments.
Side by side like fuzzy dice.
If looks could kill we'd be doing time.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.

Wherever gets that contraband and southern charm, go hand in hand.
Fooling all the federales.
Shoot in tequila, hiding the bodies.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.

We're a deadly combination, you and me.
The way I play it cool and you bring the heat.
But I got your back and I know that you got mine.
That makes us two of a crime.
Yeah, two of a crime.

// What Are You Gonna Do //

Time
It comes and goes like everything I know
It's just when I wish it would stand here still
It never will
Love
You find some, then it goes away again
You move on to the next
And by then you're just a mess
You gotta start all over again
Why does everybody want more love?

Am I the  only one that sees my point of view?
You can waste your life lookin' for somethin' to look forward to
And you  chase it
But when you catch it
What are you gonna do?

Independence
You say you're fine on your own but you come across cold
He don't feel like you need him so he goes
You're left here  alone
Why does everybody wanna be independent?

Am I the  only one that sees my point of view?
You can waste your life lookin' for somethin' to look forward to
And you  chase it
But when you catch it
What are you gonna do?

My every day seems like such bliss
But then in the end you wish someone would have told you all about
How it don't work out
Why does everybody wanna be so  naive?

Cuz you chase it
Then you waste it
What are you gonna do?

// Wichita Falls //

Alone in a booth, in the Pioneer Cafe 
I'm strung out from the road, a pillow in my hands
I sip the last straw from a cold cup of coffee
and try to sort out my feelings as good as I can
Two hours behind me there's a boy back in Dallas
my phone will be ringing his afternoon call
but he'll get no answer, the queens left her palace
She's alone in a cafe in Wichita Falls

Back out on the highway towards Oklahoma 
I'm driving and crying and hating it all
This old Chevrolet is raising the sunset
and taking me further from Wichita Falls

I don't know where I'm going I have no direction
and all I can say is I've made up my mind
I just want to travel a long way from heartache
wherever it takes me I'll leave it behind
I guess that he thought I would stay there forever 
living my life with my back to the wall
Well maybe the waitress will send him that letter 
I left on the table in Wichita Falls
I'm going somewhere other than Texas
a long way from Dallas in Wichita Falls

I'm taking the highway yeah I'm going somewhere

// Y'all Means All //

If your life is like a tornado
You've been living in black and white
All you need is a smoke and a rainbow
Honey, let me give you a light
Alright
Let me give you a light

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Y'all means all
Mmm, y'all means all
Hey

Maybe there's a little scratch in your reflection
Maybe your rhinestone lost its shine
Just count on love and count your blessings
Count on me, come on let's ride
Mmm
I got a big ol' bus so jump on and ride

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a dairy queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Y'all means all

You can be born in Tyler, TX
Raised with the Bible Belt
If you're torn between the why's and exes
You ain't gotta play with the hand you're dealt

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?
Out in the country honey, y'all means all
Honey, y'all means all

Yes queen, go queen
Dip it like a Dairy Queen
Put your inhibitions in a big U-Haul
Goodwill Gucci
Where my Chattahoochies?

Hey
