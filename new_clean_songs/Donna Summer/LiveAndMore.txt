// I Remember Yesterday //

I remember that first night we wet
Dancing to the sound of clarinets
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet
You and me and this fantasy
Oh, I remember our first night

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
From the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
Oh, I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

I saw your lovelight through the candle's glow
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go
And when the night was over,
We both looked around the room
Remember darling, chairs on the table,
And only me and you

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
And from the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

Walk me home in springtime showers
In the early morning hours
You took me to my door, we were sure
So we swore that forever more
I'll remember our first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

// Love's Unkind //

Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard
When the schoolbell rings
And when he passes in the hallway
Well he doesn't seem to notice me
He's got a crush on my best friend
But she don't care, 'cause she loves someone else
I'm standing on the outside, not the inside where I wanna be

Love's unkind, love's unkind
Love's unkind, love's unkind
'cause he's not mine

Just the other day I was praying that he would give me a chance
Hoping he would choose me for his partner
For the high school dance
I was standing outside the class
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked
I went running back inside teary-eyed
And left the two of them behind

Love's unkind, love's unkind
Love's unkind, love's unkind
'cause he's not mine

[Spoken:]
Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know
'cause he loves my best friend
But she don't care, she loves someone else
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind
Love's so unkind
She said: just keep it alive
'cause you may find love's unkind

Love's unkind, love's unkind
Love's unkind, love's unkind

[Spoken:]
Oh, Why did I have to love him so
Why did I have to love him so

// I Feel Love //

Ooh
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good
Ooh
Heaven knows, heaven knows
Heaven knows, heaven knows
Heaven knows
Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

Ooh
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free
Ooh
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me
Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

Ooh
I'll get you, I'll get you
I'll get you, I'll get you
I'll get you
Ooh
What you do, what you do
What you do, what you do
What you do
Ooh
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

// Once Upon A Time //

Once upon a time...

Once upon a time
There was a girl
Who lived in the land
Of dreams unreal
Hiding from reality,
Treated like a stranger
Living in her fantasies,
Trapped within their world

Once upon a time
Her hopes had died
No one there to hear
Her futile cries
Living in a house of stone,
No one on her side
Family in name alone,
No place left to hide

Aaahhh.....

Once upon a time...

Once upon a dream
A man will come
And give her everything
She wants and loves
But in the morning
She'll awake
To face the room around her
It's just another lonely day,
And bitterness surrounds her
Bitterness surrounds her

Aaaahhhh...

// Faster And Faster To Nowhere //

[Spoken:]
Where am I going? What is the place?
Somebody help me outta here.

Oh I'm walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere
Oh I'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere
'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare
No matter which way-mare

[Spoken:]
Seems that there must be some way to get out.
But I just can't find it.

People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future
Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to
Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys
Where no one should dare go
So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere

[Spoken:]
I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun
The city closing in

Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little

Children crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them
It's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them
'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare
No matter which way-mare

[Spoken:]
Help me, I wanna get out.
Cut it out! Stop closing in on me HELP!!!

Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little

// Fairy Tale High //

On a fairy tale high

Don't you believe that your dreams all come true
The fairy tale world inside can bring it to you
You just have to wish, and you'll take off and fly

On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high

On a fairy tale high

Just look around you, the dark clouds are far
Stand on your tiptoes, and reach for a star
As stardust comes sprinkling, it will brighten your eyes

On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high

Fairy tale high, fairy tale high, fairy tale high

On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher

// Rumour Has It //

There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it

Rumour has it all around the town
Someone's looking for a girl like me
Where can she be found
I hope it's who I think it is
I wonder if it's really him
It's got to be the man I love
No one else but him

Rumour has it

They say he's gonna make this girl his everything
He's gonna love her and surround her
With all those beautiful things
It was the most wonderful moment in my life I had
My life ended on that evening
I lost him, Lord it hurt so bad

Rumour has it

You never know just what you've wont until you've lost
And the object of the game is not to pay the cost
Anyone can play the game, there are no rules
And you never know just what you've won until you lose

There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it, rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Such a rumour

I know he's gonna find me
I know this was meant to be
Well you can change a lot of things in your life
But not your destiny
And when you find the best thing in life has come to you
Hold it in your hand real tight or it may slip through

There's a rumour, there's a rumour

You never know just what you've won until you've lost
And the object of the game is not to pay the cost
Anyone can play the game, there are no rules
And you never know just what you've won until you lose
And you never know just what you've won until you lose

There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it, rumour has it
There's a rumour, there's a rumour

// I Love You //

Well he searched and searched for nights and days
Till he found the one he loved
And he wrapped her in his arms again
And then he thanked the stars above
That he found what he'd been looking for
And he stared her in the eyes

He said "I love you"
He said "I love you"
Love you, love you

She stared him right back in the eyes
With a look of disbelief
Then she gazed off into somewhere else
Was it real or just a dream?
And she pulled him, oh so close to her
And she whispered in his ear

She said "I love you"
She said "I love you too"
Love you, love you, love you

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky

They said "I love you"
Yes, I really do
They said "I love you"
Yes, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky
So if you find someone you love a lot
You must never let them go
You just hold them tight with all your might
And you say three little words

You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"

// Only One Man //

[Spoken:]
You know ladies and gentlemen
Please know this
I really love my man
And I want, exactly what he's got
And I don't ever mind giving him every
Bit of my love
And baby you know
I've got a lot to give

I got fire in my touch
There's nothing I won't do
And I bend over backwards
Just to give it all to you

Cause there's only one man
That can handle all this love
Cause there's only one man
That I want to be with tonight
Cause there's only one man
That can squeeze me inside

The one man in my life
And that's you, you and you and you

Cause there's only one man
That can handle all this love
Cause there's only one man
That I want to be with tonight
Said there's only one man in my life
And that's you

// The Man I Love //

[Spoken:]
I just wanna say this
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with
And maybe some of you men too

Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be rich and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And maybe for awhile
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

[Spoken:]
You know I'm the kind of lady
That always seems to find the wrong man
At the wrong place at the wrong time
It's not that I go out looking for him
But somehow he always seems to find me
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man
That comes home with candy
And flowers sayin' "come on put on your dancing shoes
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine"
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man
That comes home fussing
And fighting, breaking my best dishes
And beat my head outside the wall
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

// I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good //

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)

[Spoken:]
Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?
And how about you?
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!

My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

[Spoken:]
So you see on Monday nights
I just go out and drink and drink

But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
Cryin' my heart out
Lord above me (come on) make him love me
Then he should
I got it bad baby
I got it bad baby
I got it bad and that ain't good!
No it ain't good at all you know

[Spoken:]
But listen Mister big shot I've got your number
And I'll take care of you
And you too and you and  you and you

// Some Of These Days //

Some of these days
You're gonna miss your Donna
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You'll miss my kissin'
You'll miss me honey
When you're far away

You're gonna be so lonely
For me only
Cause you know daddy
You had you way
And if I leave you
You know it's gonna grieve you
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' Donna
Some of these days

And if I leave you
You know it's gonna grieve you
You're gonna miss your sweet little Donna
Some of these days

Hey honey call me when you got time
Know what I mean...

// The Way We Were //

[Spoken:]
Well you ladies out there
You know what I'm
I'm talkin' 'bout ya
But you wanna know something?
Did you ever try to remember or
Or just place up a memory in your mind
And it always seems so far away
So hard to find

Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-color memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
(oh yesterday) for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again

[Spoken:]
Tell me, how many of you would live your lives again
I would too
You girls?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
And so it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember

The way we were
The way we were
Whoaaahhhh

// Mimi's Song //

[Spoken:]
You know tonight is a very important night
For me for a number of reasons
My little girl is here tonight
And I don't think you understand
What it's like being the daughter of
Someone who's always gone
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes
"Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?"
And so my daughter looked up at me
Last week and she said "mummy
When are you just gonna stay home
One day and be with me"?
And so it kinda struck me funny
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent
Anytime with her for a long time
So I sat down and wrote down this song
After she went to bed
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime
I would sing her son

I bet you ask yourself
Why I'm never there
It's not because I like being away
You see I've made a spectacle of myself
And it seems that the whole world needs me
I understand when you cry alone
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes
You see it's only because
I'm out being someone to make you cry

I got a little letter
And I read it on the plane
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain
I wish that I could be there
To touch your face again

Mimi you're beautiful
Mimi you're mine
And other things that I do in my life
Seem to take up all your precious time

There's so much I long to say
So much more I long to do
But I guess it's all just have to wait
Till I can get to see you

Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you fill my life

You fill my life with so much love
Cause you're beautiful
And you love me
And you'll understand

Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight
"Goodnight"

// Last Dance //

Last dance
Last dance for love

To hold me, to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad

So let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance this last dance tonight

Last dance
Last dance for love

// MacArthur Park //

Spring was never waiting for us dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, nooooo

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, nooooo

[Instrumental Interlude]

// One Of A Kind //

You're one of a kind

Right from the start
You tore me apart
You took the best part of my heart

Body and soul
You took me out of control
You stole the best part of my heart

You're one of a kind
You've got magic
I know you're one of a kind
Baby you're static

Right from the start
You tore me apart
You took the best part of my heart

Body and soul
You took me out of control
You stole the best part of my heart

Right from the start
You tore me apart
You took the best part of my heart

Body and soul
You took me out of control
You stole the best part of my heart

So stop with the pretending
So come on down
And hear me when I cry
