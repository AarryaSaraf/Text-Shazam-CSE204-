Album: FourSeasonsOfLove

// Summer Fever //

Winds may come and the winds may flow
But there's no wind can cool me of my fever, summer fever
Summer fever

Time of love, time of year
Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever, summer fever
Summer fever

A heat-wave run, a dog-day night
We're making love, things are right, it's fever, summer fever
Summer fever

You burn so deep with your love so sweet
And you satisfy and mystify my fever, summer fever
Summer fever

Body to body, arms entwined
Locked in your love, feeling fine with fever, summer fever
Summer fever

Time of love, time of year
Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever, summer fever
Summer fever

Winds may come and the winds may blow
But there's no wind can cool me of my fever, summer fever
Summer fever

You burn so deep with your love so sweet
And you satisfy and mystify my fever, summer fever
Summer fever

Fever, summer fever
Fever, summer fever

// Autumn Changes //

This love of ours is gradually fading
Something is wrong, or somebody's faking

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Too many nights sitting here waiting
Too many days hoping and praying

Something inside seems to be dying
Most of the time I just feel like crying

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Oh yes we can, sure we can
Sure we can, sure we can

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Oh, yes we can, sure we can
Sure we can, sure we can

// Winter Melody //

Emptiness and just a memory
Love is gone with nothing left for me
All those wasted feelings for something I no longer have
I never knew that love could hurt so bad

Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
'cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own

I can't bear to see the sun go down
Casting stormy shadows all around
Nothing seems to matter, I just get by from day to day
I never thought that you would leave this way

Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
'cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own

Winter melody
Play for me, just for me
'cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own

Loneliness, that's all that's left for me
Happiness is chilled by winter's breeze
I keep on remembering the day that you came along
And since you left, well I just sing the song

Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
'cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own

// Spring Reprise //

[fade in:]
Ooh, something's coming over me
Ooh, I think it's got a hold on me, it's got me

Ooh, just the man I hoped you'd be
Ooh, just the man to set me free, you got me, you got me

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new, oh yeah, me and you, oh baby

Ooh, guess I'm falling much too fast
Ooh, hope this love is gonna last, I've fallen

Ooh, the feeling's getting really strong
Ooh, you give me strength to carry on, I've fallen, I've fallen

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new
Oh, baby...
[fade out]
