// Weakness //

Sometimes I'm Virginia Woolf
Sometimes I'm James Dean
Sometimes I'm my only friend
And my own worst enemy
My right hand never knows
What my left one's gonna do
But I never meant to cause the harm
That I have done to you

Sometimes I drink beaujolais
Sometimes I drink gin
Sometimes the whiskey does me right
Sometimes it does me in
You've seen all my darkest shades
And everything I've been
Still I can hurt myself much more
Than anyone else can

I'm running for no reason
I'm running and I'm blue
There's no better cure for it
Than being next to you
I can't hide what I am
I guess it's plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me

Sometimes I live in a penthouse
Sometimes I live in a shack
Sometimes I fall off the wagon
Like a train running off the track
But I reckon that I'll jump back on it
Get this monkey off my back
Before I wind up back in prison
Or give myself another heart attack

I'm running for no reason
I'm running and I'm blue
There's no better cure for it
Than being next to you
I can't hide what I am
I guess it's plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me

// Don't Say It //

Don't call the preacher when your car won't start
Don't call the doctor with a broken heart
Don't count your money til it hits the bank
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't pull the shades when the lights burn down
Don't shake the cage and let the tigers out
Don't clear your throat when you've got nothing to say
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't say you love me then act like you're above me
It's funny how you can be with someone and still feel lonely

Don't blame mee for what you did to yourself
Don't fall in love if you're in it for your health
If you drink all night you'll be thirsty all day
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

No, don't say you love me then act like you're above me
It's funny how you can be with someone and still feel lonely

I've been wondering what the hell's going on
Who gave you the right to do me so wrong
I don't care about your rules cause I don't want to play
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't count your money til it hits the bank
Don't clear your throat when you've got nothing to say
If you drink all night you'll be thirsty all day
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way
No, don't say you love me when you treat me this way

// A Little Pain //

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Too many obligations I'm trying to keep
Gotta please everybody except for myself
But like Levon said, "Ain't in it for my health"
Everybody thinks it's all work and no fun

But a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone

When I come I home, I've gotta leave
My reality is only make-believe
Someone said it's one or the other
But I'm breaking my back and working like a mother
Who's to say just how it's done?

And a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone

Baby, slow down, better hurry up quick
I feel so good that it's making me sick
And I didn't mean to call your phone
I said, I like you the best when I'm all alone
It's been real but I gotta run

And a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain, a little pain never hurt anyone

// Learning To Lose //

[Margo Price:]
On the day before the day before the new year
The snow is falling on my prairie home
I'm so far away from where I started
But no closer to where I belong

[Willie Nelson:]
How many trails have I gone down for no reason
Just to learn that I can't leave myself behind
And the only devil I've ever seen was in the mirror
And the only enemy I know is in my mind

[Both:]
Won't you tell me how long must I pay off these dues
Won't you tell me, is winning learning to lose
You said it, oh but say it's not true
Is winning really learning to lose

[Margo Price/Both:]
Everywhere that I turn the cards stack against me
And I wonder, was it bad luck or just design
[Willie Nelson/Both:]
And all the things I've had to do without have been a blessing
But sometime a blessing is a curse in disguise

[Both:]
Won't you tell me how long must I pay off these dues
Won't you tell me, is winning learning to lose
You said it, oh but say that it's not true
Is winning really learning to lose

Is winning really learning to lose

// Pay Gap //

Honey, I work so hard for my money
And I leave my babies at home
Breaking my back trying to bring home a check
And working my fingers to the bone
At the end of the day it feels like a game
One I was born to lose
This institution a dead revolution
Is giving young women abuse

Pay gap, pay gap
Why don't you do the math?
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half

It's not that I'm asking for more than I'm owed
And I don't think I'm better than you
You say that we live in the land of the free
Well, sometimes that bell don't ring true
It's been that way, with no equal pay
And I want to know when it will be fixed
Women do work and get treated like slaves since 1776

Pay gap, pay gap
Don't give me that feminism crap
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half

No matter your religion, no matter your race
No matter your orientation
No matter your creed and no matter your taste
No matter your denomination
We are all the same in the eyes of God
But in the eyes of rich white men
No more than a maid to be owned like a dog
A second-class citizen

Pay gap, pay gap
Why don't you do the math?
Pay gap, pay gap
Ripping my dollars in half

// Nowhere Fast //

Well I've been traveling so long that I can't go back
Cause I'm too far in
I've got my ticket and my bags are packed
And I miss my child
Lord, I miss my friends
But even they quit calling me on the phone
Asking me how I've been

Maybe I'm to blame for the shape that I'm in
Maybe I'm insane
But I'm leaving you again
Living in the present
Trying to forget the past
I'm going nowhere fast

When the new wears off and you're on the floor
And you can't find your self-respect
But you sure can find the door
All those late-night drives
And those roadside dives
And you can't get a decent meal
Or enough sleep behind your eyes

Maybe I'm to blame for the shape that I'm in
Maybe I'm insane but I'm leaving you again
Living in the present
Trying to forget the past
I'm going nowhere fast
Yes I'm going nowhere fast

Nowhere fast
Nowhere fast
Nowhere fast

// Cocaine Cowboys //

Well the boys round here ain't like the boys back home
They don't plant the fields, they won't work the farms
The boys round here well they talk too fast
When the times get hard, no they won't last

Cocaine cowboys
They're bad in the saddle
But they're coming from New York, LA, and Seattle
They're all hat, they don't rope no cattle
They don't ride no bulls
Cocaine cowboys, they never get sleep
With their bloodshot eyes, their cigarette teeth
I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys

Well they're riding the rails right before the show
Better call up James when the bag gets low
The crowd thins out the longer they play
You can't write a song with nothing to say

Cause the cocaine cowboys
They're bad in the saddle
But they come in from New York, LA, and Seattle
They're all hat, they don't rope no cattle
They don't ride no bulls
Cocaine cowboys, they never get sleep
They're out in the bars and grinding their teeth
And I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys
And I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys

// Wild Women //

The music and the parties
Jack Daniels and speed
Looking for an answer
But a question is what I need
And I only want to ramble
It's the one thing on my mind
I don't want this trouble
But it's all I ever find

Riding down the highway
Masquerading every night
It's hard to be a mother, a singer, and a wife
But all the men they run around and no one bats an eye
I don't want this trouble
But it's all I ever find

Wild women they don't worry
They have no time for the blues
They kill the pain and beat the devil in a hurry
And wild women, no, they don't worry

Every time I slow it down
I always get the blues
I've lost more than most my age but I still got more to lose
I might seem a little crazy when I come to your town
The devil he won't catch me if I drop the hammer down

Wild women they don't worry
They have no time for the blues
They kill the pain and beat the devil in a hurry
Wild women, no, they don't worry
Wild women, no, they don't worry

// Heart Of America //

My sweet mother gets up so early in the morning
She turns on the stove and she makes a pot of coffee
My daddy fills his tractor up with diesel to plant the corn
And that's how it was on the day that I was born

Well the days they went by and the bins filled up with grain
My mother's brother died on a motorcycle in the rain
The town got too big for its britches and the government it came
And now it will never be the same

No one moves away with no money
They just do what they can
To live in the heart of America
Getting by on their own two hands
You can pray to anybody's Jesus
And be a hardworking man
But at the end of the day, if the rain it don't rain
We just do what we can

Some time back in eighty-six
When big banks took the throne
They asked about every local farmer try to dry his own corn
But the men in the suits had a bigger plan
Than to let it be our own
When the crops came in that spring, they were blown

And Neil and Willie tried so hard
And battles they have gone
But that was still long after the bigger war had been won
No one was there to save the wheat and the cattle at my home
They took every field my family owned

No one moves away with no money
They just do what they can
To live in the heart of America
Getting by on their own two hands
You can pray to anybody's Jesus
And be a hardworking man
But at the end of the day, if the rain it don't rain
If the bank it don't break
We just do what we can
You just do what you can

// Do Right By Me //

I never won at scratch offs but my daddy always bought em
My great-aunt spent her life in Virginia pulling cotton
I don't have no microwave or a flat screen TV
If you don't do right by yourself, you do right by me
Do right by me

Long as the winters are sometimes your mind breaks up
Bars are full by the afternoon and everybody's drunk
Sometimes I look down the road for a sight I'll never see
If you don't do right by yourself, you do right by me
Do right by me

Do right by me
Don't sell me down the river or put me out in misery
Do right by me, do right by me

I knew I had to get away so I left that one horse town
Ain't much for a girl to do except get knocked up and settle down
The only dream some people have is to win the lottery
If you don't do right by yourself, do right by me

Some people climb a ladder till the end up at the bottom
Spending up all their precious time on money, fame, and stardom
All I ever wanted is my own song to sing
If you don't do right by yourself, do right by me
Do right by me

Do right by me
Don't sell me down the river or put me out in misery
Do right by me
For all that means
Do right by me
Do right

// Loner //

Being born is a curse
Dying young is worse
Finding love is the meaning of life
And in the land of the freedom, invisible chains
You get what you pay for
Sometimes you pay twice
And you go through the motions
Confused and alone
And wonder why truth ain't easy to see
And they put you through school
And tell you you're grown
And put you to work to buy shit you don't need

What's the matter with being a loner
Even a nobody's somebody, too
Even the bums on the street are just dreamers
A face in the crowd no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you

And if you don't fit the mold they call you a failure
You travel too much and they'll say that you're lost
And you can take your pick
You either came from an ape
Or the dad of a magic man up on a cross

And loneliness follows
It's always there with you
Through marriages, mortgages, sickness, and health
And you can fight your whole life to be who you are
Then decide if you'd rather be somebody else

What's the matter with being a loner
Even a nobody's somebody, too
Even the bums on the street are just dreamers
A face in the crowd no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you

// All American Made //

I woke up from a movie I immediately forgot
I got a heartache on the bottom and a headache on the top
The part of me that hurts the worst is the one I just can't spot
And it's all American made

Through everywhere I go, somebody puts me in the dirt
And everything I say, somebody says they said it first
But I don't need ten million, baby just give me one that works
It's all American made

I have been all over but I can't help feeling stuck
Something in my blood line or something in my gut
Says go to California in a rusted pickup truck
It's all American made

1987 and I didn't know it then
Reagan was selling weapons to the leaders of Iran
And it won't be the first time and baby, it won't be the end
They were all American made

But I was just a child unaware of the effects
Raised on sports and Jesus and all the usual suspects
So tell me, Mr. Petty, what do you think will happen next
It's all American made

And I wonder if the president gets much sleep at night
And if the folks on welfare are making it alright
I'm dreaming of that highway that stretches out of sight
And it's all American made
It's all American made
It's all, it's all American made
