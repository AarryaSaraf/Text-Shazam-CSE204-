// Drake Era //

It's real, it's real
(Coughing and mumbling)
Yeah, uh

You see me & you see terror (oh yeah)
I got stripes like a flag bearer
Peggy, Peggy, I'm the new young Mayweather
I'm just trying to take hip-hop out the Drake era
Fuck a mob
Fuck a squad
Fuck your mans and them
You singing ass niggas don't know how to be men
I hit your baby mama
Gave that bitch a new tan
I talk that greasy shit
And hit them with a new dance
Oh my God (oh)
Peggy, Peggy
You're so good
Fuck whoever said you up you up to no good
Cause I'm the man in the street
The man with the beats
And the man holding heat
I drop bombs like I drop science (whoo)
Drop a body off like a dropped client
Drop 6
Drop Top
Drop FaceTime
I give a fuck about peace
I spit hate crimes
Who the fuck you know could kill 'em with these cold lines?
Young Peglord on the mic
Bitch, it's go time
I piss white boys off in my spare time
Tugging at your heart I'm the black Ben Carson
So try me if you really wanna
No seriously (yeah)
Try me if you really wanna
Who the fuck told you Peggy wasn't getting paid?
I square up with a square nigga and catch a fade

Swisher sweet (swisher sweet)
Ain't nobody can fuck with me
Kill the beat (kill the beat)
Backpackers they loving me
Oh my God (God)
OH God (oh God)
Huh, huh
Swisher sweet (swisher sweet)
Ain't nobody can fuck with me
Kill the beat (kill the beat)
Backpackers they loving me

Bitch ass niggas be too committed to the act
I know you wanna jock
Imma take you off the atlas
With your Indie ass
And you Metacritic rappers don't get no pass
You got these white girls singing
These white girls singing
But niggas never feel you so you play it like you different
I'm a fucking grave digger
I don't see these boys
You step in my sandbox
You gon' see these toys
You suburban ass niggas need to stay in your place
No snaps, no tweets
This is straight to your face
Fuck 'em
I bring death to any nigga that try to rattle me
You casualties actually factually you ain't as bad as me
Niggas say they charged up
Imma drain your fucking battery
Split your ass in two and you still will never be half of me, Buster!
Fuck your mob
Fuck your squad
Fuck your mans and them
You indie niggas just wanna be black men
I've been real all my life
You're like MC Ride
Two crackers call your album "nigga" and you let that slide, pussy
Get the fuck out of my genre, my genre
Get the fuck out of my genre, my genre
Rich kids trying to go urban no shaman
But this a new era
I took hip-hop hostage, fucker

Life is like a box of chocolate
Life is like a box of chocolate girls

But I can let up, I go for the gold

Gotta get my ends up

Tired of being in the friendzone
I 've been out in the endzone
Touchdown on a real place
Got down in the real space
I've been down on my space
Ever since the days of Myspace
I was driving in the tri-state
You got expired plates
I've been outside waiting
For the right moment
To talk, To talk, To you oh

Oh my God
These pigs want to take my life
26 no job
And now they're gonna take away my license
I'm a failure
Hope my niggas can bail me
Out of this cell that I'm goin' it
Fuck all you bitches I'm going in
My momma told me I'd be dead when I'm 25 (25)
Jokes on you, bitch, I'm still alive (still alive)
He came closer
I grabbed my toaster
Put the gun to the dome of a dead cop
Who's the owner
[*gunshot*]

Been in all, been in all, been in all, been in all
I
That I know, that I know, that I know, that I know, know

I've been on Xans
Keep the coke in the can so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
I've been on pills
Keep the grams in the seal so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
I've been all night
With my hand on the pipe so you punks understand me (punks understand me)
Send a pig to the grave
Bad with the brains punks understand me

Gotta get them ends, get them ends
Hope the cops don't shoot my friends, shoot my friends
(Hey, yeah)

Attitude vivid, I run and y'all panic

You niggas is plastic

Fag through a factory
Track a chapter from great times

Jared bought a nice style colorful canvas
S class finessed fans double my catches
So and so
And dust to ashes
Funeral fig cleaned up
Check the fabric
I come quick like some neck with talent
Pump the vehic's

Breathe on a bead

// The 27 Club //

[*Bell Chimes*]
And we on...

Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake yea
At the 27 club
I pray the lord my soul to take
Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake yea
To the 27...
Say [?] Jimi Hendrix

I'm Jimi Hendrix
Baby I'm Jimi Hendrix
Throw that pussy at me
I'ma take it if you lending
Party hardly
Never talk cop
And my tracks make these white hoes strip
Nigga dead-ass
I love rap but I never buy the music
I just download it for free
Then I talk shit
Rhyming's easy
Anyone can do it
That's why I say fuck that new
I want that old shit
I'm all indie baby I love garbage
Sling out wack tracks & pitchfork loves it
Critic-core legend
Certified bitch-made
Asshole niggas
Thinking they got the best taste
At 27 I'ma asphyxiate
On my own bullshit
While I'm looking for a fix
So fuck a black fan...
Crackas make figures
Cause' God don't like ugly and no one likes niggas

And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

I'm Janis Joplin
I sing like an old time slave
Plus I look twice my age
Live from summertime
An OG vulture
Mother-fuck a spook
I'ma profit off the culture
Real nigga lover
I used to play the backroom
Trouble on my mind
I fuck hippies in the bathroom
Big Momma Thorton
My ball and chain
Bitch I'ma do you like Elvis did
Never get credited
Overdose on sedatives and heroin and medicine
Oppressed white female
I'm a mother-fucking feminist
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me who I'm better than
Bitch you not heaven sent
A thief is all you ever been
On the road to riches
They gon' catch me out my element
But if I play the victim
They gon' treat me like a veteran
Pot kettle rhetoric
Vocal chords need severing
I never had an original bone in my skeleton

And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

They call me Kurt Kobain
I don't like fame
I strum guitars
I snort cocaine
I am...
One fucked up nigga
The Earth is my bedroom
The sky is mirror
And I look up in that bitch like errrday
Smile to myself and thank God I'm paid
Because I could be like you
A keyboard warrior
Youtube confessin' in the comment section
Dick getting hard off a thumbs up blessing
And when you get ignored
It's like fuck! now I'm stressing
I took the high road
Instead of being the nigga that talks shit
I'd rather be the nigga that walks it
Hop skip and jump
Cause I'm rich as hell
Stick to the script
Like an actor
But I don't play no roles
I'm hip hops Death Note
And I'm killing off
Every single fucking blog rapper bitch

And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

// This That Shit Kid Cudi Coulda Been //

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Alabama to Maryland
New York to Japan
JPEG stays true

Yeah
This the life of a rap nigga
This the life of real life trap nigga
This the life of the JPEG
Coins in the cup, shed a tear for a bass head
God damn, I hate feds
Head shot from the outside, no Jessie Ware
Black hair, black beard
Said she don't believe in love, she the black Cher
I told her take care, baby, no Drakes here
'Cause we face fear, we don't like fakes here
Real nigga since Space Jam, daycare
Same place they sold crack, I played there
Let the sink ship, nigga, this a shark tank
Kevin O'Leary gon' have to walk the fuckin' plank
They wonder if I'm donkey or a elephant, shit
Just know that I never fall or never fail

Ya'll know I keep it funky, motherfucker
Better get it right, get it right
Better get it right, get it right
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Ya'll know I keep it funky, motherfucker
Better get it right, get it right
Better get it right, get it right

This that shit Kid Cudi coulda been (Oh!)
But that nigga wasn't built to win
So I'ma do it for him

[Dylijens:]
Ayy, ayy, futuristic brown man ready to get down
Spit rhymes, steady aim, enemies sit down
Lit now, don't trip, I ain't the one
Oh damn, law man got a badge and a gun
Enough about pigs and carsonages
They close to the dope, it's so intimate
If I try, I can die slow if you into it, but you not (Yeah)
Spend all of my tips on expensive coffee
My phones been tapped, tell the feds to get off me
Now every time I speak, somebody listen to me talkin'
Look over my shoulder every time that I'm walkin', ya
See this hipster
Don't blink to the pity, they off me
Don't think your harm can bother me
Look out for the cops like my father taught me
Lotta arms expected, went to save the block
I'ma slave to the day, and these clocks, they haunt me
Lock me in a room so I can burn the broccoli
Record and release 'til I start to feel cocky
Somebody try to stop me
Can't live with delusions of persecution
Try to stay grip to the earth that I'm losing
My brains strange trying to maintain my A-game
Stay sane but boy you don't play games to play gains

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Y'all know I keep it funky, motherfucker
Better get it right, get it right
Better get it right, get it right
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Y'all know I keep it funky, motherfucker
Better get it right, get it right
Better get it right, get it right
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

// 2015 Was A Great Year //

Sin city
Sin city, yeah, I'm in it, man
Rest in peace, rest in peace, Kelly T, all my niggas
Yeah

I lost my license this year
But most these niggas never had one
I'm speeding down the highway looking for grand outcome
My daddy moved back to Jamaica, told me I'm the man son
He said he want a grandson, but he gotta be black
You only fuck these crackers bust it in they throat or they back
Not the inside, grandma passed, I never said bye
Fell out with my sister, I see her, I'll never say hi
Got off the plane in Okinawa, now I'm stateside
Moved to Baltimore 'cause I figured it was a goldmine
Met a girl in Hampden, I figured she was the only
But mama told me these bitches is bitches
Let 'em be lonely, 'fuck em
Car crash putting me in a tough position
Worst credits but more debits, I'm fuckin' wishin'
No TV or WiFi
I'm scrolling down my timeline, thinking about how much a life I'm missing
Bank account looking damn, only get overdraft
New job [?]
Same shit, different staff
Unlock my phone and go straight to the Instagram
Need to see these crackers living lavish just to get me mad
So I can open notepad and bomb on a nigga
Young black mutant bringing storm to you niggas
2016, I'm still a legend in my own mind
'Cause niggas got expensive tastes but never pay you no mind...

// Try Me //

Niggas wanna be gods
I'm in it

One time for the little line baby girl
I'm in that thing like what
R.I.P. to my haters out in the D.R
Tryin to live they life gettin killed by fucking latinas
If it was up to me I'd end they fucking history
Deport em if they got no papers, oof the irony

But see this shit was never new to me
Warned you niggas about that black-brown unity
This racism shit is too deep for any philosophy
I don't know why you dumb crackers had a monopoly
I don't know why y'all fraternizing with enemies
Don't know they race so them fuckboys pretend to be
Anything they wanna be
Got some fuckin wannabes
Zoe Saldana [?]

Black to the core bitch my skin on extra fleek
Y'all been piggybacking offa niggas since slavery
But that shit stops here I rose to the pulpit
And brought extra bullets for that hola papi bullshit

Red hooks on em like Spike Lee
I said I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red hooks on em like Spike Lee

3-3-4-4-1-0
5-1-6-7-1-8
And everything in between

Before I get to the business
I haven't spit a punchline since Christmas
Amazon guns get clipped with the quickness
Ya must want death on your wishlist, bomba
This that headshot close proxy
Gotta question for you bitches in the hot seat
What would G.G. Allen do let's dig up the body
Put that cracker on his knees and let him pray to my shotty

Young thotty, Benghazi
I catch bodies
No leader mask gone somebody stop me
The real marxist harmonist I'm a nobody
Black Jesus, dark casear I rep commies
I wish a fuckin officer would try to run up on me
2nd amendment, bitch I got the Glock on me
Hot steppin who's fuckin with the young Devon
Send yo ass to heaven go to 7-11

I said I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red hooks on em like Spike Lee
I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red hooks on em like Spike Lee

Niggas be talking bout what they wanna do to the prophet
Bitch stop it I'm John Hopkins I close coffins
Straight stalkin

The fellas marchin
Tryin your best to be cautious
This is coins over paper
I'll pay the bill for your wake
I kill a coppa and bake 'em
Ship 'em off to Jamaica
Brake a dread with the vapor
I never been in the paper
But when I do
City of God, Z in the making
Bitch know I
Never trust a preacher or a rabbi
Compress me or check me bitch I'm a motherfuckin landmine
Young black landline password is these cans flying
All up in your cubicle
Bitch I work on my own time
Kill a cop for full time and take him out as old time
I don't give a fuck about a nigga talkin gun rhymes
Peg more than showtime

Flash a nigga to blam him and make him give me a cosign
