// Jones Vs. Jones //

We don't feel like talking
There's nothing to be said
I guess it's just confusion
Rolling 'round our heads

Still we know there's love here
We just can't work it out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

We had a love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?

'Cause I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Of Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones
It's me and

You believed in me once
Girl, I believed in you
And, and woman
Who loves so beautiful

Still we know there's loving
We just can't work it out
When the hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
September never seemed so cold
Where in the world did love go?

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones

I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Of Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones
Mr. and Mrs. Jones

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
The hardest part of all day
Is breaking up, breaking up and out

Always will believe in, baby
Who's to blame for a name that's changing?
I just can't believe it, baby
Goodbye, baby
Jones vs. Jones

I just can't believe it, baby
It's all over but the memories
I just can't believe it, baby
I can't believe it

Jones vs. Jones
I just can't believe it, baby
Goodbye baby

// Just Friends //

Lady, we'll never pass this way again
so maybe now we can be friends
And still I know we tried to make it
but I can't stand the pain no more

(Never really lovers, just friends)
But we cannot hide this feeling inside
now I know for sure, we were just friends

You and me are just friends girl

Crazy to let this thing go wrong for so long
We got to find a way to be strong
But I longed to have you next to me
tough I know it's not the way it should be, oh no!

(Never really lovers, just friends)
Tell me girl is this the end, baby
(Never really lovers, just friends)
But we cannot hide deep down inside
now I know for sure that we were just friends

You and me, baby
(we're just friends)
we're just friends darling
(Never really lovers, just friends)
We will allways, allways be friends
(Never really lovers, just friends)
We're only friends now baby

Maybe one day we'll be together again
and maybe then be more than just friends
And still somehow we gotta make it
But I know it's not the way it would be, oh no, no, no, 
no, no...

(Never really lovers, just friends)
Tell me girl, is this the end
(Never really lovers, just friends)
I cannot hide this feeling inside
now I know for sure, we were just friends

(Friends)
We will allways be yeah, friends girl
Lovers no more
(We're just friends)

// Night People //

Night people, oh, oh
People of the night

I wanna talk about the night people on the street
You can be sure that you're gonna meet
Night people out for a midnight dream
After the lights have gone down, yeah

Late at night there is a feeling of pure delight
That's when the night people meets their height
When all the lights have gone down, yeah, yeah

(Night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dance in the street
Just like the people of the night?
Yeah, you see they're dancing, romancing

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dances like those?
(People of the night)
They will always be bound
When every night comes around

Mystery flows through the air
On a tempting breeze
Urging the night people loud and free
After the lights have gone down, yeah

Music plays up until morning, they all will stay
Night people dancing the night away
When all the lights have gone down, listen baby

(Night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dance in the street
Just like the people of the night?
Yeah, you see they're moving and grooving

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Ooh baby
(People of the night)
Do you know that

I see you come alive, baby
In the starlight, every single night
Your face is like the moon that's shining
Makes me smile and feel alright

At midnight there's a love bite
Love is the feeling in the air

(Night people, oh, oh)
Yes I'm one, I like to have a lot of fun, yeah
(People of the night)
Moving and grooving with the night people
Every night

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Did you know? You see them out on Broadway
(People of the night)
Dancing the night away, oh

// Love Affair //

Well, I just finish this letter and
I hope it finds you in good health, in love, so

Hello my love, I'm feeling fine, how are you?
Every minute seems eternal but I'll stay true
What I'm going through over you, thinking of you

Then just a week you've been gone, miss you dearly
True love, they say is healing with you near me
What I'm going through over you

I can't wait to hold you, see morning in your eyes
Can't wait to love you in loveless paradise
So I send you love by name, sealed with a kiss
Love, let it be the blame

Love affair
Love affair
Girl, I love you
I love you

??, play the part, we grew stronger
We will always win its lovely hunger
What I'm going through over you, thinking of you

I hope your trip was easy, trouble free
So hurry, hold my angel onto me
What I'm going through over you

I can't wait to hold you, see morning in your eyes
Can't wait to love you in loveless paradise
So I send my love by name, sealed with a kiss, baby
Love, let it be the blame

Love affair
Love affair
Girl, I love you
I love you

You and me, forever angel
You and me, love affair
You and me together forever
Love dreams
