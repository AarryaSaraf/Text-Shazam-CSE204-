// Who's Gonna Take The Weight //

People, the world today is in a very difficult situation
And we all know it because we're the ones to created it
We're gonna have to be the ones to clean it up
We're gonna have to learn to live together and love each other

Because I believe one day someone or something
Is gonna wanna judge who's creating
All this corruption and death and pollution
And all these difficult situations on earth

And He's gonna wanna know
Who's gonna take the weight

Who's gonna take the weight
I don't know, I don't know
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight

Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight

// Wichita Lineman //

I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overload

I hear you singing in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
