// F.F.F. //

Farewell my fairweather friend

Senseless reasoning
You believe what you want to believe
Farewell my fairweather friend
On you no one can depend
Bad times
Now they must end

Whatever you want it to be
For you that's what it will be
Honesty to you is arbitrary

Logic is lost in your 
Cranial abattoir

Shallow
Empty inside
Sly witted 
Full of snide

Bad times
Now they must end

The shutter-speed of your thinking process 
Is small
Too small
Too full of pride

Bad times
Now they must end

Farewell my fairweather friend
Bad times
Now they must end
Farewell my fairweather friend
Farewell my fairweather friend

Bad times
Now they must end

You used to be nice
Now you're twice as nice
You used to be good
Now you're too good

Farewell my fairweather friend
Bad times
They must end
On you no one can depend
Farewell my fairweather friend

Logic is lost in your cranial abattoir
Shallow
Empty inside
Sly-witted 
Full of snide
The shutter-speed of your thinking process 
Is small
Too small
Too full of pride
Lost in a storm

Farewell my fairweather friend
Bad times
Now they must end
Bad times
They must end
On you no one can depend

Farewell my fairweather friend
Farewell my fairweather friend
Farewell my fairweather friend
Farewell my fairweather friend

Could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be black 
I could be white 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be white 
I could be black 

Your time has come 
Your second skin 
The cost so high 
The gain so low 
Walk through the valley 
The written word is a lie 

May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be right 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be right 
Could be black 
I could be white 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be black 
I could be white 
They put a hot wire to my head 
'Cause of the things I did and said 
They made these feelings go away 
Model citizen in every way 

May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 

Anger is an energy 
Anger is an energy 
Anger is an energy 

May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 

Anger is an energy 
Anger is an energy 
Anger is an energy 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be right 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be black 
I could be white 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 
I could be black 
I could be white 
Your time has come your second skin 
Cost so high, the gain so low 
Walk through the valley 
The written word is a lie 

May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 

I could be wrong 
I could be right 
I could be wrong 

They put a hot wire to my head 
'Cause of the things I did and said 
They made these feelings go away 
A model citizen in every way 
Your time has come your second skin 
Cost so high, the gain so low 

May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 
May the road rise with you 

Anger is an energy...

// Fishing //

Closed mouth catches no flies
Burning bridges as you're crossing is not very wise 
When analysed
Be tongue-tied
Play snakes and ladders
But not suicide
Like casting pearl before swine

Talking to you is a waste of time 
You burned the bridges you've been crossing
Go crawl back into your dustbin

Crawl back in your own dustbin

From you expect this lack of respect 
To be sly
Not one of a kind
Pretty picture
Bad frame of mind 
Like casting pearl before swine

Talking to you is a waste of time
You burned the bridges you've been crossing
Go crawl back into your dustbin

Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl

I've learned caution
This comes from wisdom 
These altitudes
These dizzying heights
These bottomless pits
These sweet delights

Like me
You are unlike me 
Like me
You are unlike me

Go crawl 
Back in 
Your dustbin

Talking to you is a waste of time
You burned the bridges you've been crossing

Under surveillance
Sweet subservience
I think you're stupid
But you're worth the mention
People who need people 
Are the stupidest of people

Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl back into your dustbin
Go crawl back into your dustbin

// Round //

Round and around
Around, around, round, round 

Round and around
Around, around, round, round

Round and around
Around, around, round, round

Well of course
We've always had it in us

For a million years
Sleeping halitosis
Deaf ears provide 
Perfect pure protection

Round and around
Around, around, round, round 
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon

You seem to say to say 
Nothing can be something
Ignorance now 
Dominates the season
Cruel fool
Idiot and spastic
Dutch courage 
Talking like an ashtray

Round and around
Around, around, round, round 
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon

How many of you have seen a factory
As the boss held high
And the children die
Don't lecture here
Don't spit on my life

Round and around
Around, around, round, round 
Mushrooms on the horizon
Mushrooms on the horizon

Round and around
Around, around, round, round...

// Bags //

Black rubber bag...

Sun burns in a perfect day
Now smell the air of this perfect sky
Silent sweet
A precious place
Desirable shade
Beneath the pinion pine

Drawn by the beauty 
Of my own terror
Close to the edge
Swallow the void

Vultures fly 
The Arizona sky
These tell-tale signs
Bloated body like a TV dinner
Let the death move in 
And let the feast begin

Flock of flowers
Desert develops fever-blister 
After the rain

Black rubber bag...

Flock of flowers
Desert develops fever-blister 
After the rain

Black rubber bag...

// Home //

Better days will never be
Better days will never be
Better days will never be

Now what does this mean
It means we get the best scenes
When politics talk, the ends of power meet
Nice to be wanted, safe and protected
The ends of power, when politics talk

Better days will never be
Home sweet home, home, home

Now let's talk politics
Every dog has its day
For me (for me)
I don't believe (I don't believe in anything)
Better days ahead (one more war)
Will never be (I do believe no more)
I don't believe in (no long goodbye)
Anything (nuclear day)

Spare no man, match bomb for bomb
War, all is fair in war
When the ground is soft with hot blood
Spare no man

Better days will never be (match bomb for bomb)
A scorched earth (flatten the earth, this home sweet home)
No charity (burn everything, from lust to dust)
No weak pity (no charity, no weak pity)
From lust to dust (all is fair in war)
Home sweet home

// Ease //

Now
Now pay no heed
Don't care for you

These things in ease 
These things in ease
These things in ease

You can generalise
Very easily

These things in ease 
These things in ease
These things in ease

Walk and talk
Dysentery

These things in ease 
These things in ease
These things in ease

Susan and Norman
You're so normal 
Susan and Norman
You're so normal

Procreation
Have a nice day

These things in ease 
These things in ease
These things in ease

What makes you happy
Your misery

These things in ease 
These things in ease
These things in ease

Susan and Norman
You're so normal 
Susan and Norman
You're so normal
