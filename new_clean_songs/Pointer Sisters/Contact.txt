// Twist My Arm //

Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
I'll give you something
Don't you want it that bad
Do you want it
I can give it
'Cause I've got it
You just twist it

If you wanna hold it
If you wanna show it
Come and let me know it
Just twist my arm
I'll be here to please it
Always here to feed it
Love you like you need
Just twist my arm

Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
Oooo-ooo- twist my arm

I've got a sweet tooth
I like sweet things
Nothing turns me loose
Like the sugar you bring
Do you want it
Can you use it
I can fix it
You just twist it

Don't save it for someone else
Don't slip it to me on the sly
Just tell me what you want
Don't have to tell me why

// Hey You //

Everybody wants the real thing, no imitations
Everybody wants the same thing, some tender love
Everybody on the rebound, breaking up in two
Everybody going downtown, I'm reaching out for you

Gotta wonder what the score is, sure is a shame to me
Don't you see the little children begging but no one ever sees
In the middle of the night time ohh I, I got to know

Hey You, tell me what's been going on
Hey You, tell me what's been going on

People living in the city, don't know their fellow man
People living in country, don't buy no master plan
People sent in from Erasure, to seek the promise land
Everybody wants their freedom, but do they understand

Gotta wonder what the score is, sure is a shame tome
Don't you see the lonely people, we've been following to believe
In the middle of the night time, Oh I, I got to know

Hey you, tell me, what's been going on
This world, our world, what's been going on

// Back In My Arms //

No one can see what you been doin'
No one but me, I'm always watching you
I'm your conscience
I'm your conscience

No one can see what you been hidin'
No one but me knows what's inside of you
I'm your conscience
And I'm talkin' to you

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearin'
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms, oh, yeah, yeah

When you're hot I feel the fire
Until I'm caught up in your sweet desire
I'm your conscience
Listen to me

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearin'
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

What I feel
You may not understand
Oh, but you, oh you're still the only one
The only one for me

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you hear
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearin'
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearin'
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

// Burn Down The Night //

Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came
And they tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said, "Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert. E. Lee"
Now, I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if my money's no good
You take what you need and you leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother up above me
Who took a rebels stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
And I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
The night they drove Old Dixie down
When all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
The night they drove Old Dixie down
When all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And you could hear 'em all singin', they went, na na na

// Dare Me //

I've got a chip on my shoulder
With your name on it
(Knock it off)
So don't just stand there foolin'
If you don't want it
(Knock it off)
I say you're either a lover
Or you are a liar
So don't you push too hard
You're playin' with fire

[Chorus:]
Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me
I wanna take you on
I know I can't lose
I'll be loving you
If you just dare me

Looks like you're lookin' for trouble
And I'd say you found it
(You found it)
You'll have to come right through me
There's no way around it
(You found it)
I hope that lean hungry look
Means what it's saying
'Cause I'm just sittin' on ready
Ready and waiting

[Chorus]

Come on and dare me
If there's any truth
Behind your intentions
This night's gonna end up on fire
You better believe it
You better believe it, oh baby

Oh, dare me, dare me,
Dare me

[Chorus x3]

// Freedom //

Freedom, freedom let me go

Do you want to know me?
I would like to know you
Do you want to talk to me?
I would like to talk to you

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

If you don't trust me
I'm never gonna trust you
If you don't try to understand me
I'll never understand you

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

I'm talking about freedom
Do you want to know me?
I'm talking about freedom
I would like to know you
Talking about freedom
Oh let me go

If you take my eyes
I'll still be watching you
And if you take my voice
I'll still hear me saying

Oh, oh I just wanna love you

I wanna take you there
Oh baby talking about freedom everywhere
Freedom for you, freedom for me
Freedom, freedom
Let me go, let me go, let me go

I want it now, I want it now, I want freedom
Love and understanding
Oh talking about freedom, talk about it
Just love talking about freedom again
Freedom, let me go
Don't let it hold you back
