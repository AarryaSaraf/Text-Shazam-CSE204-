Album: BreakOut

// Jump (For My Love) //

Your eyes tell me how you love me
Can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, I can feel you
Getting hotter, oh baby
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more, more

Jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump you want to taste my kisses
In the night then

Jump, jump for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms
Can feel you up
Jump, you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love

You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try and
Go much farther, oh baby
You're the one, you, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more,
If you want more, more, more then
When you are next to me, oh I come alive

Your love burns inside
Feels so right
Come to me if you want me tonight jump
Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, you know my heart can
Make you happy
Jump, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump in, you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love

// Automatic //

Look what you're doing to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down

Your camera looks through me
With it's X-ray vision
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in a circuitry

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)

What is this madness
That makes my motor run
And my legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire
And shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure
They tell me

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)

Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic

Look what you're doing to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down

Your camera looks through me
With it's X-ray vision
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Wind up locked in the circuitry

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)

// Baby, Come And Get It //

You call me up at two in the morning
Honey ya burnin' up the telephone wire
You say you can't wait 'til tomorrow
And that you need me to put out your fire

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
You sure want a lot for your dime
Then you talk so, so sweet and dirty
You drive me right out of my mind
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got

I swear that every time is the last time
'Cause I know there ain't no future in this
And then from the heart of the darkness
Comes that call that I can never resist

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
Why can't you leave me some pride
Then you whisper 'cause baby I need you
And I go all to pieces inside
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got

Come and get it
Come and get it

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
Why can't you leave me some pride
Then you whisper 'cause baby I need you
And it tears me all to pieces inside
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
Come and get it while it's hot
Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
You always get the best I got

// I Need You //

Something's wrong
Things aren't right
And it turns into a silly fight
You walk out
I get mad
And we both just end up feeling bad
Through the heat
Of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm
There's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true
And I want you here beside me
I need you
'Cause nobody's going to love me
The way that you do
Baby won't you come and hold me
Hold me in your arms
Didn't tell you that I need you
I need you
By my side
And although we're going to
Fight sometimes
I need you
By my side
Please don't walk away and we'll be fine
Through the heat
Of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm
There's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true
You know I need you
You know I won't you
I got to have you
By my side

// Dance Electric //

I can feel the power surging underneath the wires
It's calling us, urging to come into the fire
There's a chain reaction when the music hits the streets
It's a transformation of current into body heat

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

Dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in this dance electric
Come on and dance

There's a red hot circuit in the heart of the machine
And the force that's working it is taking over you and me
Then it synchronizes every movement that we make
When the voltage rises, we let all the circuits break

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

Dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in this dance electric
Come on and dance

There's a chain reaction when the music hits the streets
It's a transformation of current into body heat

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

[?] dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in the dance electric
Come on and dance

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

// Neutron Dance //

I don't want to take it anymore
I'll just stay here locked behind the door
Just no time to stop and get away
Cause I work so hard to make it everyday

Whoo oooh
Whoo oooh

There's no money falling from the sky
Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind
Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due, I got no place to stay

Whoo oooh
Whoo oooh

[Chorus:]
And it's hard to say
Just how some things never change
And it's hard to find
Any strength to draw the line
I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance

Industry don't pay a price that's fair
All the common people breathing filthy air
Roof caved in on all the simple dreams
And to get ahead your heart starts pumping schemes

[Chorus]

Whoo oooh
Whoo oooh
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

[Chorus]

I know there's a pot of gold for me
All I got to do is just believe
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
And I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance
I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance
I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance

// Easy Persuasion //

You don't have to tell me
What you say with your eyes
What I want to hear is
There's more here tonight

I know I can't be sure
You're not mine, I'm not yours
But my heart needs to believe
More than it wants to see sometimes

And if I run from you
I'll miss the best of you

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And be with me tonight

You don't have to spell out
Each letter to me
One word, one whisper, one sweet invitation
Is all that I need

Something that I can feel
Some traction for my wheels
Oh my heart needs to believe
More than it wants to see sometimes

Don't let me run from you
I'll miss the best of you

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And it will be alright

Easy persuasion
All I need tonight
Just tell me you love me
And be with me tonight

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And it will be alright

// Nightline //

Every night around midnight
The call comes through
Turning on my night light
'Cause he'll know what to do

I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Call me on the nightline, alone
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline
What I like to hear

Make it person to person
Heart to heart
Darling, your flame
Is sending of sparks

I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Call me on the nightline
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Say me through the pipeline, baby
What I like to hear

[Instrumental]

Call me on the nightline
Call me on the nightline

Hello, is that you?

Call me on the nightline
Waking me up
Call me on the nightline
Can't get enough

Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear

// Telegraph Your Love //

Stayin' up all night my heart won't stop
There's a fire in me to feed
I can't touch you baby
All you've got to do is beam it into me
So won't you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won't you telegraph your lovin'

So don't you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won't you telegraph your lovin'
That's what I need

// Operator //

You were headed in another direction
And then you saw me
I knew that
You were ready for the connection
And I could feel your desire

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Don't leave me now
I can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind

I got a notion
You know just how to move me all over
I'm caught in a motion
Like I've never been here before

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Don't leave me now
Can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind

I couldn't think of anything better
I couldn't leave it alone
Don't know how I'll ever resist you
I really want to go on

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on don't leave me now
Can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind
