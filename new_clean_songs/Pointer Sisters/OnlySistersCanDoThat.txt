Album: OnlySistersCanDoThat

// It Ain't A Man's World //

For too long
we've been neglected and treated wrong
It's time you see
that every woman has her needs

Equality
that's what we want
Foundation
to build upon

It's time you changed
Look past my body and see my brain

[Chorus:]
It is time
(Every man needs a woman)
Time you accept the truth
Just want to know
I go to work until your kids give birth
Without me, what would you do?
Stop - because it ain't a man's world
Cause every boy needs a girl
I said it ain't a man's world
Open your eyes, you'll find a pearl

Cook and clean
That's all a woman used to mean
Don't you know it's time you change
Look past my body and see my brain

[Chorus]

[From Maya Angelou's "I Shall Not Be Moved":]
One thing about me, I'm little and low
Find me a man wherever I go
They calls me string bean because I'm so tall
When men see me, they're ready to fall
I'm young as morning, fresh as dew
Everybody loves me, so do you
I'm little and lean and sweet to the bone
They like to pick me up and carry me home
When I passed 40, I dropped pretense 
Cause men like women who've got some sense
55 is perfect, so is 59
Cause every man needs to rest sometime

[Chorus]

Equality, that's what we want
Foundation, to build upon

Through hardship
we stood the test
You can't deny us
because we ain't done yet

[Chorus]

// I Want Fireworks //

I've never believed in smooth sailing
After every high waits a storm
We've both been out in the cold before
to come back and make each other warm

Please spare me monotony
And surprise me with each day

[Chorus:]
I want fireworks
I want the whole shebang
Come on and kiss me
like the first time
Over and over again
Strike me with cold, blue lightning
Make me tremble like a quake
Oh hold me, baby, tighter
Don't worry, I won't break

I know there's no love without crying
Good and bad live door to door
We both have stepped on each other's heart
But God knows our love is getting more

Please spare me monotony
And surprise me with each day

[Chorus]

I am addicted to dangerous fire
when sparks are flying
Blood rushing faster,
the whole world is spinning
and love's worth dying for

[Chorus]

// Only Sisters Can Do That //

Walking home from school
breaking every rule that's in the book
(Remember when we were still in school?)

Singing in the street
Harmonies complete
That's all it took
(Just throw a dime -- throw a dime, we'll sing for you)

Cause I know that girl
and she knows me so well
Her story, I can tell
It's just like mine

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Only sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Take a look back in history)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can

Love would come and go
Mama didn't know the fun we had
(She didn't know where we went after school)
Playing with the boys
Switching them like toys
Oh we were bad
(We were bad, we were nobody's fool)

And we have laid the ground for all the girls in town
but they won't stay around
They just won't last

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Make you feel like family)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can

We can do that
We can do that

Only we can do that
Only we can do that

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Only sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Take a look back in history)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can

// Tell It To My Heart //

Someone gave me a rainbow tonight,
and I'm living my daydream
Someone gave me a handful of light
Someone's pulling my heartstrings

It came to me in a minute
Passage of time won't diminish
Now I'm shivering inside
You touch me and oh
I just let it go

[Chorus:]
Tell it tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
I could have told you from the start
You would be my only one

Not my usual state of mind
There is no indecision
Come on, baby, we'll just take our time
What we don't know we'll just fill in

Each word you say got me spinning
You're in my life, now I'm winning
And I'm trembling inside
You touch me and oh
I just let it go

[Chorus]

And I can't help it, baby
You make me feel
like I don't want to wake up without you
Can't believe that I fell in love in a minute
(love in a minute)
And now that I'm in it
(now that I'm in it)
Deep down
(Deep down)
In it with you

[Chorus]

Live a little bit
Love a little bit
I need a little bit, my only one

Live a little bit
Love a little bit
I need a little bit, my only one

[Chorus]
