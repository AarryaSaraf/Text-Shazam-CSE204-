// Friends' Advice (Don't Take It) //

Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it

Uh-huh, uh-huh

They tell you he's not right for you
Don't they think you know that, too?
I know that he's not playing fair
I've known it for years, I'm still here
So do you think that I care?
They say, "Go out and have some fun"
"Go out," they say, "with other men"
That sounds like a simple task
But what do you do when no one asks
Do you go out with his best friend?

When it comes to friends' advice
The following usually applies:
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it (No, no)
Don't take it (No, no)

After a month, I was tired of staying home
I looked great, but so what? I was alone
See, the last time I listened to my friends
I saw one of them walking down the street
With my ex-man
I know he is a naughty boy (Uh-huh)
And that's exactly what I enjoy
My friends could never ever handle him
Which is the reason they don't understand

When it comes to friends' advice
The following usually applies:
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it (No, no, don't you dare)
Don't take it
You've got to listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(No, don't take it, no, no, no, no, no, no)

My friends are trying to save my sanity (Sanity)
I really do hear what they're telling me, oh-oh (Telling me)
It's just too hard to take them seriously (Seriously)
'Cause girlfriends, they don't practice what they preach
One of them's going with Jack the Ripper
One of them's got a snob
One never gets taken out to dinner
One of them's got a slob
One of them's got the bore of the year
Another one's got a fool
One's got a man who don't even care
The other has one who's still in high school
The rest are alone(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)

Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)

// After You //

I found a letter to her
I guess you're thinking of leaving
But if your love hasn't died
If there's a spark to revive
Think about it before you leave
Don't make a hasty decision
There's so much we stand to lose
And honey I can't envision

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, baby, how should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights after you?

Don't be a stranger to me
Just tell me what we are missing
Something's still keeping you here
You're torn in two, but to me it's so clear

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, baby, why should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights?

Ooh, after you, ooh
Is there something I have done wrong?
Tell me, boy, don't just move on

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, honey, why should I survive?
How will I stand lonely nights after you?
(After you) After you, baby
Oh, I'm all but through
Listen, baby, just walk in my shoes (Walk)
Feel my heart breaking in two
After you, oh, there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, honey, why should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights?
After you, oh, there's no one (No one)
After you I'm all but through

// You Knocked The Love (Right Outta My Heart) //

You knocked the love I had
(Understand what I'm saying?)
You knocked the love I had
(You know what I mean)
A-boom-boom, ah-ha (Oh-oh)
A-boom-boom-boom-boom
A-boom-boom, ah-ha (Oh-oh)
A-boom-boom-boom-boom

I forget ya, 'cause when I met ya
Boy, you were the baddest thing that I've ever seen
Before too long, something went wrong
You turned out to be low down and mean
You gave me something that I never had
A lot of insight of a man going mad
I thought you were on a mission from Hades
You were like a mad dog with a case of the rabies

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
You just went wild (You lost your style)
And you knocked the love right out of my heart
You knocked the love right out of my heart

You had the look (And), and then it took
This heart of mine, and I didn't even care
You loved me tender, had to surrender
I love your toes right to the end of your hair
You used to have it but you lost control
But now you're playing some kind of dark role
Thought I had Dr. Jeckyll but I got Hyde
That's one too many but believe me I tried

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
The day you hit me, you should have quit me
'Cause you knocked the love right out of my heart

You knocked the love right out of my heart
You took my dreams and you tore them apart
(You must accept) You must accept (you need help) you need help
You knocked the love right out of my heart, yeah
(You) You knocked the love, right out my heart
(You knocked the love right out of my heart)
Yes, you did
Hey boy, oh, woo
(Right, right out of my heart)

You knocked the love right out of my heart
You took my dreams and you tore them apart
Thought you were cool but you're a fool
Boy, you knocked the love right out of my heart
I didn't understand, love had me blind
But I saw the light when you were kicking my behind

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
You just went wild (You lost your style)
And you knocked the love right out of my heart
You knocked the love right out of my heart
(Oh, oh, oh, yes, you did, you knocked me, you knocked me out)
You just went wild (Yeah)
You knocked the love right out of my heart

(You) You (You)
Like a mad dog (You), ow
Oh baby (You), yeah
Yeah, you won't have to knock me out, oh
(You knocked the love right out of my heart) Oh
Right my heart
(You knocked the love right out of my heart) Oh, yes, you did

// Insanity //

Won't somebody come and rescue me
And break these chains and set me free
A slave of love is all I am to you
And I'll do anything you want me to
You take my heart and control my mind
And I keep running back to you time after time
So deeply emotional, all of your love drives me crazy
So I plead

Insanity
Calamity
Every time you look at me
It's insanity
Inhumanity
And baby, I'm amazed by the power you have over me

It's human want, it's something you can't have
You want just a taste but you know it's bad
So why you wanna come here messing up my mind
And take advantage of me, boy, time after time?
My friends don't know how you can drag me around
And they tell me that it's just

Insanity
Calamity
Every time you look at me
It's insanity
Inhumanity
And baby, I'm amazed by the power you have over me

(Insanity) It's insanity
Calamity, what your love can do to me
(Insanity) It's insanity
Ooh, and baby, I'm amazed by the power you have over me

Ooh yeah (She's going crazy, boy)
Ooh, ooh, and baby if I know only knew
I'd never give my heart to you
You took my love, took over me
I plead insanity, yeah

I won't take it no more, baby, no, no
Got rid of these chains, chains right now

Insanity
Calamity
Every time you look at me
It's insanity
Inhumanity
Oh, and baby, I'm amazed by the power you have

It's insanity (Insanity)

// Where Have You Been? //

Where have you been?
What are you looking for?
Tell me, old friend
When you turn out the light
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

We shared so much together
Our dreams went on forever
Living like the day would never end
Then came the stormy weather
Our lives were torn and shattered
We were forced to stop and start again

It's never easy to face the fact
That you have made a mistake and yet
Isn't it time that you found
The purpose of living that brings peace of mind?

And where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
And what are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn out the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

If we were merely strangers
Oblivious to dangers
That living in the shadows can lead you to
I wouldn't speak so freely
But in your eyes, I see me
The lesson that life has taught me I give to you

What you give out will come back to you
Isn't it time that you faced the truth?
Stop holding so much inside
Admit to yourself that you're not satisfied

And where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
What are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn off the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I'll be right there, I'll see you over
When you're not strong, I'll be your shoulder

Where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
What are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn out the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid

When I was cold
When I was tired
I didn't know if anybody cared
But you see, I had to turn around and look at myself
Nobody else understood me
(When you turn out the lights)
But I made it through
(Close your eyes for the night)
And you can too
(Does your mind go astray?)
(Are you running away from yourself?)
Running, running, running, running, running away
I've been missing you, old friend
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you, old friend
Yeah, been missing you, baby
I've been missing you, old friend
I've been missing you
I've been missing you, old friend
I've been missing you, old friend
You don't have to worry
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you, old friend
You don't have to cry no more, ah nah, baby
I've been missing you, old friend
Nah, baby
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh-hoo
I've been missing you, old friend
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you
