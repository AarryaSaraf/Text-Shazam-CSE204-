Album: LuxuryLiner

// Luxury Liner //

Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
If I don't find my baby now
I guess I never will
I've been a long lost soul
For a long, long time
I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I
So do I

Well, I'm the kind of girl
Who likes to make a livin' runnin 'round
And I don't need a stranger
To let me know my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome, so do I
So do I

Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world
Can change the way I feel
I've been a long lost soul
For a long long time
I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I
So do I

// Pancho & Lefty //

Livin' on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah but that's the way it goes

All the Federales say
Could of had him any day
Only let him any day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose

Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to gop
There ain't nobody knows

Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The dessert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So the story end's, we're told
Pancho needs your prayer's it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He just did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old
A few gray Federales say
Could have had him any day
Only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

// Making Believe //

Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
Still I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe, it's all I can do

Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe

Making believe I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do?

Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe

// You're Supposed To Be Feeling Good //

Soul mate
I see you down there
Waiting for morning
To softly be coming
I find
I'm only in deeper
And you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared

Your true love
Has made you feel better
But look out for later
When she makes you feel worse
Times change
In daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is
All I have seen

But you're supposed to be feeling good now
Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind
That the prophets would lie
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out
Over someone like me

Soul mate
The blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing
We're on the wrong road
One side
Is just like the other
Except for the color
And size of the load
And just how much it shows

// I'll Be Your San Antonio Rose //

If they'll play another love song
And if that Miller Highlife light stays dim
And if you'll keep my glass full of whiskey
I'll whisper words I wish I'd said to him

Just ask me to dance all the slow ones
Hold me close and take me 'cross the floor
I'll gently lay my head on your shoulder
And pretend this never happened before

I don't want to hear a sad story
We both already know how it goes
So if you'll be my tall dark stranger
I'll be your San Antone Rose

I wish I could tell you I love you
I wish that he weren't always on my mind
I wishes were fast trains to Texas
I'd ride and I'd ride, how I'd ride

// (You Never Can Tell) C'est La Vie //

It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madam
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment
With a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With T.V. dinners and ginger ale
When Pierre found work
A little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono
Boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm, and jazz
When the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney
T'was a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madam
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell

"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell

"C'est la vie" say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell

// When I Stop Dreaming //

The worst that I've ever been hurt
In my life
The first time I ever have
Wanted to die
Was the night when you told me
You loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

You may teach the flowers
To bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble
And teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops
To return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart
To forget

// Hello Stranger //

Hello stranger
Put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger
And you're a friend of mine
Get up, rounder
Let a working girl lay down
You are a rounder
And you're all out and down

Every time
I ride the four and six street cars
I can see my baby
Peeping through the bars

He bowed his head
And he waved both hands at me
He's prison bound
And longing to be free

I'll see you
When your troubles are like mine
Yes. I'll see you
When you haven't got a dime

// She //

She ...
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten
By everyone
And she ...
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big ol' field was her backyard
In the delta sun
Oh, but she sure could  sing
Yes, yes
She sure could sing

Then he ...
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He help her some
And he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one
Oh, but she sure could sing
My, my she sure could sing
She had faith and she had believin'
She led all the people together in singin'
And she prayed very night
To the Lord up above
Singin' hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah

They ...
Would walk singin' songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she
Never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day
Oh, but she sure could sing
Yes, yes she sure could sing

// Tulsa Queen //

I heard the train
In the Tulsa night
Calling out my name
Looking for a fight
She's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know

She sings a song
So sad and high
And the Tulsa Queen
Don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa Queen ain't crying
'Cause I won't see you again

And I want to ride
Like a Tulsa Queen
Calling out to you
As she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa
As these ten wheels can be

Lately I speak
Your name too loud
Each time it comes up
In a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa Queen and you
Are gone...
