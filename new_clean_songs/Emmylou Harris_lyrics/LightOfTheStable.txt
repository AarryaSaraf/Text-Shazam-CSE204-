// Christmas Time's A-Coming //

Holly's in the window
Home where the wind blows
The cane foam's a-runnin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.

Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'
Joy, don'tcha hear them singin'
When it's snowin', I'll be goin'
Back to my country home.

Christmas Time's A-Comin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'
And I know I'm goin' home.

White candle's burnin'
My old heart's a-yearnin'
For the folks at home when
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.

Snow flake's a-fallin'
My old heart's a-callin'
Tall pine's a-hummin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.

// O Little Town Of Bethlehem //

O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see the lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
The hopes ans fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

// Away In A Manger //

Away in a manger,
No crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing,
The baby awakes,but little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes.
I love you, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle
Til morning is nigh.

// Angel Eyes //

Angel eyes, angel eyes
The ways of the world are feeble
Don't give up on simple people

Angel eyes.......
The blues you can live without
It's not what you song's about

Angel eyes, angel eyes
Tell me what would we do without
No light from angel eyes
You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase you're turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning......... and so alone

Thin lines you've been living on
Are so close to the danger zone

// First Noel //

The first Noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.
This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

// Beautiful Star Of Bethlehem //

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star)Of Bethlehem
(Star of Bethlehem)

Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains till the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest
For the redeemed, the good and the blest
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Where Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

// Golden Cradle //

Sweet babe, a golden cradle holds thee
Soft thy mother's arms enfold thee
Fairest flowers are strewn before thee
Sweet birds warble o'er thee

So sleep, my babe, and dream away sorrow
Peace until you wake tomorrow
I will guide thine infant slumbers
Angels watch thy number

// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavely hosts sing alleluia;
Christ the Saviour, is born!
Christ the Saviour, is born!
Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.

// Light Of The Stable //

Hail, hail to the newborn king
Let our voices sing him our praises
Hail, hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our savior

Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia

Come now, there it shines so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Lean close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and the thankful

Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
