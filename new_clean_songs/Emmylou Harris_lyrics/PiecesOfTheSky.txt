// Too Far Gone //

I know that somewhere there's someone you love more than me
Someone you love more than me
And I hate to say it, but you have a right to be free
I know that's the way it should be

But I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone

If ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you

'Cause I'm too far gone
Too far gone
I love you so much for so long
And I'm too far gone

// If I Could Only Win Your Love //

If I could only win your love
I'd make the most of everything
I'd proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray when you're away

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love

Oh how can I  ever say
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love

Oh how can I  ever say
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love

// Boulder To Birmingham //

I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below
But all that it can show me
Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
It was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain in the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn.

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace.
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face.

Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive.
I have come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on ninety five
And pretend that it's the ocean
coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby do you know what I mean

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace.
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face.

// Before Believing //

Winter Summer seasons is taken over  it's quiet
Like new fallen snow
I told you summer stories  but outside is getting mighty cold
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
How would you feel if the world was falling apart around you

Pieces of the sky were falling in your neighbors yard
But not on you
Wouldn't you feel just a little bit funny
Think maybe there's  something you oughta do

Solutions that never lay down before you the answers are all around
Believing is all the friend you need to talk to
Believing in you
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could

I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could

// The Bottle Let Me Down //

Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

Tonight the bottle let down
and let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let down
and let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

// Sleepless Nights //

Thru the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Somehow thru the day I don't give in
I hide the tears  that wait until
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Why did you go   why did you go
Don't you know  don't you know   I need you

// Coat Of Many Colors //

Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use

There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes

They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only  if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me

// For No One //

The day breaks  your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
She no longer needs you
She wakes up  she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one

A love that should have lasted years
You want her  you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you
She goes out  you stay home
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one

A love that should have lasted years
Your day breaks  your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her

// Queen Of The Silver Dollar //

She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her  chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryna to win her favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down,
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my  throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home
