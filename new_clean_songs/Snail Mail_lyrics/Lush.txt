Album: Lush

// Stick //

Do you dream about the people that wrong you?
Do you see those faces again and again?
And what holy thing has come to possess you?
Or does it all just blend together in your head?

And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
Cause' I can't wash this one clean

Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?

Up late for six nights in a row
Figures in the dark, oh they move so slow
Sleep with the lights on in the hall
And you'd leave the door open
It won't mean a thing at all

And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
Cause' I can't wash this one clean

Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?
Would they stick around?
Would they stick around?

It doesn't matter
They're up and they're down
And I'll bet
That they're at home
And I wouldn't worry
Who's happy alone
Even when it doesn't make sense

// Intro //

Go, get it all
Let 'em watch
Let it follow
Nameless, sweat it out
They don't love you, do they?
Grace, born and raised
Cut you down
It still bleeds the same
As it is
Forgive, anytime
Still forgive, anytime

// Pristine //

Pristine
Untraced by the world outside you
Anyways
I'll never get real
And you'll never change to me 'cause I'm not looking
Anyways

Same night
Same humility for those that love you
Anyways, anyways
And if you do find someone better
I'll still see you in everything
Tomorrow and all the time

Don't you like me for me?
Is there any better feeling than coming clean?
And I know myself and I'll never love anyone else
I won't love anyone else
I'll never love anyone else

It just feels like
The same party every weekend
Doesn't it? Doesn't it?
And if you do find someone better
I'll still see you in everything
For always, tomorrow and all the time

Don't you like me for me?
Is there any better feeling than coming clean?
And I know myself and I'll never love anyone else
I won't love anyone else
I'll never love anyone else

If it's not supposed to be
Then I'll just let it be
And out of everyone
Be honest with me
Who do you change for?
Who's top of your world?
And out of everyone
Who's your type of girl?

We can be anything
Even apart
Out of everything
It doesn't have to be this hard
I could be anyone
But I'm so entwined
And out of everyone
Who's on your mind?
No more changes
I'll still love you the same

// Speaking Terms //

Oh, don't say it now
Wait, don't just give up
Move from your old house
This city can be so loud

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow

Inside of reverie how do you know
When you've gone too far?
And it's all ash and dust
Well then I won't let you to take me for a ride

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow
Leave things on speaking terms
And I'll see you around

It's all ash and dust
I won't you let you take me for a ride
And it's all over us
And still I won't let you take me for a ride

// Heat Wave //

I'm so tired of moving on
Spending every weekend so far gone
Heat wave, nothing to do
Woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you

Swirl in the white evening sun
Tell me that I'm the only one
And I hope I never get a clue
Green eyes, I don't know what to do

And I hope whoever it is
Holds their breath around you
Cause' I know I did

And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

Passing phases wear you thin
Same old world that you've been sleeping in
And I hope it never spends you up
Green eyes, what could ever be enough?

And I hope the love that you find
Swallows you wholly
Like you said it might

And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes

// Let's Find An Out //

â€ªJune's glowing red
Oh strawberry moon
You're always coming back a little older
But it looks alright on you

Let's find an out
We'll start anew
And with the headlights in your eyes
I see it all over you

Burn out when you want
Something that's lost belongs to you
Someone should pay for it
Well I don't know who

// Golden Dream //

Head below the surface of a frozen lake
Head in the black water, let it seep into my brain
God around your neck, though he never did too much for you
I wish I knew him better, though I don't think there's much he'd wanna do

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it I'm not wasted anymore

Tomorrow night's impatience and an endless perfect world
The morning bleeds into the golden dream just like before
Tomorrow I'll feel differently but my mind will be made up
Times that I could buy your love, though I don't think that I'd have enough

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it I'm not wasted anymore

Stupid, stupid me

// Full Control //

Don't even wanna fix it now
Should know better than to wait around
All in a haze
Couldn't shake it for the rest of the day
And if you shoot it down
You better get back up
You better get back up

And I'm sorry babe, that's not where I'm at
Shouldn't be here when you get back
Just to stand in line
Wait for you and then waste my time

And if you spill your guts
And try new clothes
And try new clothes

And in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

And hold your breath when you hold the door
I never think about it anymore
Now when I lay back
It goes to nothing and it goes to black

And if you spill your guts
I hope he's enough
I hope he's enough

And in full control
I'm not lost
Even when it's love
Even when it's not

Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even when it's love
Even though it's not

// Deep Sea //

Deep sea dive
Got down, but you stayed alive
It's only you down there
You and the bends

Lose your mind
Lose track of breathing in time
It's only you down there
Sleep with the tides

And we can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and blues

Die, my love
Breathe in twos and fours
To know what's worth breathing for
Some days it's easier than falling asleep

And we can be anyone
It took so long to know someone like you
And age in the dying sun
Wake only to bathe in greens and blues

// Anytime //

Go
Get it all
Let 'em watch
Let it follow
Nameless
Sweat it out
They don't love you, do they?
And I carved your name
In the white dulling day
Couldn't believe you were gone
Do you love me?

And the passing phases feel the same
Though you've got so much to do
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
And I want better for you

Grace
Born and raised
Cut you down
Still bleeds the same
As it is
Unusually
Are you hung up?
Or do you love me?

And the passing faces look the same
Though they don't know you
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
And I want better for you

And I'm not in love with your absence
'Cause I have fallen so hard for the space
And I've gotten to know the quiet
And still for you, anytime
Still for you, anytime
And still for you, anytime
