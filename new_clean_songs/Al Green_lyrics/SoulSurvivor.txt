// Everything's Gonna Be Alright //

Don't let this world mislead you
Don't you ever go astray
Trust in God's word and believe it 'cause it'll never pass away
We will see Him in his glory riding on the clouds of joy
Greeting us with open arms and peace forever more

I know that everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like he said He would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

Now when the sky is darkened
There will be no moonlight
We'll know the time has finally come
And he'll change the wrong to right
So if you're always searching
Trying to find the bottom line
Just give your love and life to God
He'll give you a peace of mind

I know that everything gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like he said he would
I said yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good
Play it
Everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back
Just like he said he would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

I wanna be ready, I gotta be ready
I wanna be ready, gotta be ready
For the peace, love and happiness
He's coming back like He said he would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
He's coming back for the true and good

We know He's the beginning and we know that He is the end
There's no one better if you really need a friend
So don't you ever worry 'cause he gave the quarantee
That he'll return to take us home and fulfill the prophecy

I know that everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back, like He said He would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
I know He's coming back just like He said he would
Peace and love and happiness
I know He's coming back for the true and good
Everything gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like He said he would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

// You Know And I Know //

You know and I know
I love you in a special way
And when you call me
I met you first to be my friend

Life without your love is no good at all
So I'm glad you're here to hear my call
With you by my side I'll never fall
At all, at all

You say I never pay
No attention to the things you say
And I can't understand
Why you answer every time I pray?
Cause without your love
So what can I say?
Need you more and more everyday
Talk to you and I try to explain
Explain it all

You know and I know
All about you everything you say
And without you nothing comes my way
I can't live without you not a single day

You know and I know
Your every smile
Your every frown
I try to do my best
But it's not good enough
And I'm back on the ground

Sometimes I think about my faults
I think about giving up but then
I can't think that at all cause
I can't live without your love not a single day
At all

You know and I know
I love you, I love you
You know and I know
I love you, I love you

// Yield Not To Temptation //

Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin
Each victory will help you or some others to win
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue
Look ever to Jesus and He'll carry you through

Just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through

Ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and heal you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus will carry you through

Shun evil companions, bad language disdain
God's name hold in reverence, don't take it in vain
Be thoughtful and honest, kindhearted and true
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through

Oh, ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus, He will carry you through

All I wanna do is ask the Savior to help you
Comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through

I wanna just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
He will carry you through

// So Real To Me //

I was lost deep in sin
Jesus came and took me in
Now I feel I've got a friend
I got a friend in him

Every time I feel the spirit
Moving in my heart, I pray
And it always make me say
Keep me day by day

He's so real to me
(God is so real)
So really real so, so really real
(God is so real)
So real, so real

So real to me
(God is so real)
He's so really real
So real to me

Every time I feel the spirit
Moving in my heart I pray
And it always make me say

// Soul Survivor //

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

I never doubt for a minute
The power of the word
Or the messages in it
But Jesus had to live everyday
In a blessed righteous way

So I'm taking out a policy
Gonna get some soul insurance
Jesus is my benefactor
Leaving my spiritual state
To the one I pledge my fate

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

Worldly wants won't permit it
Only suffering from a life of sin
Why don't you let go and let God?
Give you what you're searching for

He'd give you all the love
You've been missing
Save you from disaster
Just open up your heart
And let him in today
Cause it's your soul that he's after

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

In my Father's house there are many men
Every one a soul I've been told
I'm going away to prepare a place for you
And where I am there ye maybe also

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

// You've Got A Friend //

When you're down an' troubled
You need some love an' care
An' nothin', nothin' is goin' right

Close your eyes an' think of me
An' soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
An' you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin'
I wanna see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark an' full of clouds
An' that ol' North Wind
That ol' North Wind begins to blow

You just keep your head together
An' call my name out loud, yes
An' soon, very soon you'll hear me
Knockin' on your door, yeah, I will

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've gotta do is call
An' I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
'Coz people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Hell, they'll take your soul if you let them
No, don't you let them, no

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call me

And I'll be there, yes, I will, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
You've got a friend, you've got a friend

// He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother //

The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there

For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
Then I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share

And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

// 23rd Psalm //

The lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Ohh, He making me lie down in green pastures
Ohh, He leadeth me beside the still waters, ohh
Ohh, He restoreth my soul
And He leads me in the path in righteousness
For his name's sake

Yea, though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will not fear, thou art with me
Ohh, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me
Ohh,Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of my enemies

Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
Ohh, but [?] yea, my, my [?]
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, ohh, amen
Would you help me? Would you help me stay here?
Amen, why don't you have a seat? Amen
Everybody have to say is a, amen
