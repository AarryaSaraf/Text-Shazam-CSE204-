Album: ImStillInLoveWithYou

// I'm Still In Love With You //

Spending my day thinkin' 'bout you girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do
Though it hurts me so to let you know that I
look in your eyes to let me know
How you feel
Let me know that love is really real
And it seems to me
that I'm wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey

And I look in your eyes
And all the years I see
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well it seems to me
that I'm wrapped up in your love

Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you

Don't you know that I'm
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Say I try it if you want me to

// I'm Glad You're Mine //

Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah, I'm just so glad you're mine

Whoa, baby, why did it take so long?
Whoa baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine

Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Baby, I'm not gonna leave you alone
Baby, on top of that, I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, so glad you're mine

Hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Woho, boy

I know you'll never say, baby
Baby, I'm gonna turn my back and walk away now
Baby, I'll see you another day, hey baby

I'm so, I'm so
Thankful for your love, angel
Thankful for your love, every day
Glad you're mine
Aw, hey, hey, hey, baby
Hey, hey, hey, thankful for your love

// What A Wonderful Thing Love Is //

What a wonderful thing love is
I can see you standing there now
And you're the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who'll be laughin' loud but me

You made me see the love that you're givin' me
Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kinda makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man

And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me
Baby, I don't know about you
But let me tell what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you (baby)
With you, baby, yeah,

The night time find me Wetting my pillow,
But I (yeah), I don't, I don't mind, no, but if you,
You just let me say it again
I've been cryin'
I wish our trouble would leave me alone
But, I've been cryin'
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now (yeah)
Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain (yeah)

// Simply Beautiful //

If I gave you my love,
I tell you what I'd do
I'd expect a whole lot of love out of you

There's a whole lotta things
You and I could do

What about the way you love me?
And the way you squeeze me?

Simply beautiful

There's so many good things
I could say about you, girl
I could say that I really, really...

// Oh, Pretty Woman //

Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you
You're not the truth, no one could look as good as you

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Now are you lonely just like me?

Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Please, baby
Pretty woman

Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
'Cause I need you
And I'll treat you right
Come to me, baby
Be mine tonight

Pretty woman, stop awhile
(I'm gonna stop awhile)
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(Please, baby)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me, please baby, baby
(I'm not asking very much, baby just a)

Pretty woman
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, just give your smile to me
(Love me, love me, lady)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
Pretty woman, talk awhile 
(Love me, love me, lady)

Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(Love me, lady, won't you stay with me?)
(Well, then let me say it again)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
(Although I just met you, baby)
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(You don't know how I'm feeling)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(I will take if you smile to me)

// For The Good Times //

Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

// Look What You Done For Me //

Now that you're here with me, 
I want to keep you free, 
to do the things that you want to do, 
the joy in life is loving you, 
but now the day has come, 
to let you know where I'm coming from, 
the best of my years will go to you, 
it's the only thing that I can do, 
but these things don't come overnight, 
lovin' you baby, I think I'm right. 
Let me say before I forget, 
lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
oh but I feel, ya... 
Sometimes I wanna leave, but then I say, 
it wouldn't make sense at all, 

Anyway, forgive me baby, 
if I do wrong, 
I haven't been a true man for so long, 
let be say before I forget, 
lovin' you baby, it's where it's at, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
baby, do you wanna, do the thing that you oughta, 
you've been very good for me, 
and that's a fact, I say, 
ya baby, look what you done for me, 
ya baby, you set my heart free, 
oh, no matter, baby... 
what you done for me... 
I got the feelin' that it's gonna... 
ya, look what you done for me...

// One Of These Good Old Days //

Cause' I don't know,
But that's the price,
You have to pay.
