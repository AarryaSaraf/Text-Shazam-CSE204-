Album: LayItDown

// Lay It Down //

Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
put your head on the floor
lay it down, lay it down, lay it down

I just met you, just the other day
Everything started flowing my way

I just love you... really I just love you for yourself
I don't want no, no, no no no no nobody else
Hey lay it down

lay it down, let it go, fall in love
lay it down, let it go, fall in love
lay it down, let it go, fall in love

(One more thang)
your love is a wonder to me
I just love you, really, I would really love you for free

All I want to do (all I want to do)
I don't want you to change your mind
I love you baby in your time
Hey lay it down

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love

See I love you, you see, I love you before my self
you're everything I need, everything I need
ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Ever since I started holding your hand
I've never, I've never seen such a smiling man
you made me happy baby

I almost, I almost I wrapped up
When I see you, I want to love you more, and more, and more
Hey lay it down

Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love
Lay it down, let it go, fall in love

// Just For Me //

// You've Got The Love I Need //

Whoa, you're beautiful to me

// No One Like You //

There's no one in life quite like you, you baby
There's no one in life quite like you, you baby

As I sit and wonder baby how you do the things you do, yeah
I know deep down in my heart I never see all the way through
I smile and I'm glad, you're the best thing that I ever had

There's no one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
No one in life quite like you, you baby

One more thing, smoke stacks signal your love
Coming from my window pane, yeah
All I need from you baby is to take you in my arms again, yeah
One smile from you is all I need to see me through my day

No one in life quite like you, you, I love you baby
There's no one in life quite like you, hold it back there now, you baby

Here we go
One word from you is all I need
One, one, one kiss from you
Oh, will set me free

There's no one in life quite like you, you
You're so unique baby, I can't I can't explain it
No one in life quite like you, oh baby, you baby

There's no one in life quite like you, you
No one in life quite like you baby, you

Like you, like you
Early in the morning, have a smile on your face
Late in the midnight hour, no one can take your place
Even sashay, glass on wine, you're so fine

// What More Do You Want From Me //

// Take Your Time //

[Al Green and Corinne Bailey Rae in two-part harmony:]
Just you take your time, ohhh.
Just you take your time.

[Corinne:]
Do you remember when
we used to take our time
you'd write me a letter, being there
and I'd wait for you all night (ohhh)
Now it seems everyone's
rushing around including you and I
I wanna take a little time
Just to fall in love again
Cause they're telling me...

Just you take your time (No hurry baby!)
Just you take your time,

[Al:]
When I think about yesterday
everything was easy
everything was okay
(Now, now, now)
Now everything is going fast
you're the best thing I ever had
aww and losing you
aww it'd make me, make me
that would make me
feel soo bad (hey, heyy)
Would you help me saying...

Just you take your time (heee),
Just you take your time.

[Al:]
Sing low and take it slow
I'm inclined to agree
Cause ain't nobody living
Can try to hurry me (can try to hurry me)

Just you take your time
Just you take your time

Just you take your time (no need to hurry baby)
Just you take your time (why you wanna rush and worry baby)

// Too Much //

Can I have a kiss?
Can I have a touch?
It's too much baby
I don't wanna hold you back

Your smiling face
Your lips on mine
Your love divine
Oh, its too much baby

Listen, I wanna say
That its too much
Too much for me

Oh baby, too much baby
Too much for me

Talkin about a love divine

Everyday feel like Sunday
And your smile is something I can't fathom
It's just too much, I love you too much, just
I can't keep holdin' you back, it's

Your love is way too much
Baby, I said it's too much
Girl, it's too much, oh hey

I was one step closer
To your arms from mine
I feel your love so divine
It, it, it ,it, it, it, it, its
Just, just, just, just, just, too, too much
Too much for me

I, I want to take you in my arms
Just one more time I'm askin'
Give me your love
I don't need no hug

It's too much
Too much for me
Oh, that loves just
It is too much

Oh now, it's too much for me
Baby, it's too much

Walk with me, hold me near
It's not as late as it seems (No, no)
So why'd you take your love away from me?

La la la, la la la (la la la)
La la la
Stay with me (by the sea)
La la la, la la la (oh)

In the morning light
Or the shades of white
You're the only who tries
So why's it mean I'm saying goodbye?

La la la (oh), la la la (stay)

Stay with me (come on and stay)
La la la, la la la

Hold my hand, my dear

// All I Need //

I wanna tell you one last time, all I need
Don't want no fussin, don't want no cryin
You're everything to me

All I need, all I need, all I need
Let me say you're

Once over and again for the last time
Something very wonderful is on my mind
Can I say it twice?

All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need

We can work it out with no delay
We don't have to fight nor take all day
Hear me now, hear what I say
Hear my plea because

I don't need nobody else
All I need, all I need, all I need

All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need

// I'm Wild About You //

There's always talk about love
What do you know?

And just you and me

No doubt, hey, hey

I'm wild about you baby
Girl, I'm wild
I'm wild about you baby
There ain't no doubt, oh Lord

There's always talk about things I
I cannot change, oh Lord

You don't know how I feel
Hey, baby

You're down in my heart
You're down in my mind
You're down in my soul, yeah

Soul, yeah, I love you so much
I wanna take you in my arms and
Take you in my arms and
Take you in my arms and I, I

Moping down about some things I
I can't remake, oh yeah
I'm standing on the one I can depend on
And there can be no games

I'm wild, ability
I'm wild about you baby, yes sir
I'm wild about you
I'm wild about you baby
I'm wild, I'm wild

I'm wild about you baby
Good God see why
Going wild about you baby
You don't know how I feel
