// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some
Mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's
Child is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this
Simple phrase to kids from
One to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times
Many ways
Merry Christmas to you

// Winter Wonderland //

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? We'll say "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town."

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids come knock him down

When it's cold, ain't it thrilling
When your nose, gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'm dreaming tonight of a place do I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back, I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me, oh
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam
I want you to know
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams, oh

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Oh,

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam, oh
I want to be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

// Jingle Bells //

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over fields we go, laughing all the way
(Laughing all the way)

Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
Ohh,  what fun it is to laugh
And sing a sleigh song tonight

Ohh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, yeah

Ohh, what fun, ohh

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
(Jingle all the way)
Ohh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

In a one horse open sleigh
In a one horse open sleigh
In a one horse open sleigh
One horse open sleigh

// What Christmas Means To Me //

Oh, yeah
Candles burning low
Lot's of mistletoe
Lot's of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah

I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As reaches and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once
And then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas
Baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And happiness
Happiness in the coming year
Oh, yeah

Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
(Christmas means to me, my love)

Let's deck the halls
With holly
Sing a silent night
Fill a sheet
With angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Hey, yeah

That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Yeah
Oh, yes

// O Holy Night //

Oh, Holy Night
The stars
Are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear
Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin
And error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night
Oh, Holy night
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night

// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round your Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
