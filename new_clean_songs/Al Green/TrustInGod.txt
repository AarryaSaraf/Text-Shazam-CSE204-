// Up The Ladder To The Roof //

Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night 
Oh I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days.
Don't be afraid 

Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.

Stay with me
And we shall let expressions sing
Hear freedom virtues ringing
Oh memories of yesterdays broken dreams 
Don't you know they'll all fade away
If you'll come

Up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.

We'll laugh and I'll tell you the story of love 
(How it is) and the happiness in it baby
We'll combine our thoughts and together we'll travel 
To the fountain of loveliness.

I will never ever ever leave you alone to wonder 
As we go on 
Our love, it will grow much stronger stronger.
Don't you wanna 

Go up the ladder to the roof where we can see heaven much better.
Go up the ladder to the roof where we can be oh closer to heaven.

// Ain't No Mountain High Enough //

Listen baby, ain't no mountain high, 
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough; 
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name;  I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.

Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there

Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.

No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.

If you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,

'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.

// Lean On Me //

Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
But, if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.

Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend,
I'll help you carry on. For it won't be long, till I'm gonna need
somebody to lean on.

Please, swallow your pride, if I have
faith, you need to borrow. For no one can fill those of your
needs, that you won't let show.

You just call on me, brother when you need a hand,
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand, 
we all need somebody to lean on.

Lean on me, when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend,
I'll help you carry on. For it won't be long, till I'm gonna need
somebody to lean on.

You just call on me, brother when you need a hand,
we all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand, 
we all need somebody to lean on.

If, there is a load, you have to bear, that you can't carry,
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load, if you just call me.

Call me......
