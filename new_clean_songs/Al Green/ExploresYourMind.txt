Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby
Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby
I've been gone so long I know what to do
Oh baby

Oh baby
'Cause you make me happy baby, so I can say

Sha la la la-- la la la

Oh baby

Ya, heh, baby
Aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy baby, let me sing

Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby
Sha la la la-- la la la
Oh baby...

// Take Me To The River //

[Al Green:]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Hey hey

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

[Lenny Kravitz:]
I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all those things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

[Sheryl Crow, Lenny Kravitz, Al Green, BB King:]
Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't take no more
Take me to the river

[BB King, Lenny Kravitz:]
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes you put me through
The sixteen candles burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know
Oh won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

One more time!

[Al Green, BB King:]
Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground
Take me to the river

// God Blessed Our Love //

God blessed our love
Even in the morning when I rise
I say, God blessed our love

And every morning when I rise
I can just see heaven more in your eyes
It makes me know this is not an everyday love, no, no
We've got something, I'm sure we can be proud of

Oh, we've got so much, show much love
We've got so much, so much trust
Can't you see a halo, a halo?
I can see a halo hovering over us

And oh, I didn't meant it, baby
But God, blessed our love
I have to say it this evening that
God, oh God, blessed our love
If you've got something to be thankful for
You oughta just say, hey
God, blessed our love
I'll have to say this evenin'
God, oh God, blessed our love
I swear He did

Let me say, I could just stand up
And tell the world, oh babe
That you're mine, all mine, all mine
Your love is heavenly desire
And I just have to say, I like kissin' you
I like, I like, huggin' you
I like squeezin' you, wanting you
Holding you, loving you
I'm glad, I'm still lovin' you, come on, baby
Let me say that when people, yeah
People, yeah, start to criticize, it don't bother me
No, no, 'cause I know God, God
God is on our side

You see and let me just say that
God, God blessed our love
I have to say that, God, blessed our love

// The City //

I see the lights of the city
Great big city
Wonderful city
And the people standing all around
Standing on the ground
And making sounds
I've been waiting for so long
I've gotta stop searching
My whole life will be gone
All my life

I'm gonna take my time and way
To the great big city oh
The wonderful city
Some people say that love ain't fair
Don't give a care
Go around and swear
I might as well not be there
My heart is in despair
It just isn't fair
I'm feeling well I've come from so far
Gonna get out from, from my car

I've gotta make some sound
That'll raise the walls
Of that great big city
I wanna go to that beautiful city
The city, city

I better stay just here go now
Riding in my car
Looking at a star
Won't you try to open up now
Look what's in there
Don't you think it's fair
I, I ain't playing by the walls
I've got it people down there
Hey, I've gotta make sure
Of that great big city
I wanna go to the wonderful
Beautiful, wonderful city
Yeah, I wanna go, I wanna go
Don't you wanna go now

// One Nite Stand //

Well, you've taken everything we've got
Even the guitar and the band
They were makin' the right moves
Playin' in the blues like a light is at hand

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright

Don't you wanna go
Well, you've taken a right notion
Enough to fill the world and the ocean

While we're driving in your car
No one knows who you are
Let me know who, big people in power

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright

New York City, don't you wanna go, c'mon
Yeah sure, climb on
Don't you wanna go, c'mon

// I'm Hooked On You //

Since I met you, baby
My life, my life has changed
My heart has filled with love
'Cause you made me a brand new man

But I'm missin' you so, I can't let you
It's all in my heart, it can't fall apart
Lovin' you, you know it's true
That I love, I'm loving you, hey

Your love, our love will never die
If it does, I'll, woah, cry
'Cause you showed me so much love to give
Talk about will to live, is this love for real?

So real that it's my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby

// Stay With Me Forever //

Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met

This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be 'round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days

Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done, all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me, baby, yeah
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?

Please take my love, that's all I have to give
Just right now you're giving me a reason to live
Help me understand what I feel is real
For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years

And if you let me there is nothin' I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I just want you to stay a while with me, baby
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
C'mon and stay

Oh, c'mon take me by the hand, oh
Heaven, I want you to cherish me
C'mon, c'mon

// Hangin' On //

I can't understand the way you feel
Well, in my heart, baby, I'm for real
It's just the way I am as you can see
But is this love between you and me?

It's all because of you
I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
'Cause I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Just because, oh baby, just because
I love you, you know I do

People like to talk, good and bad
In my heart, I know it makes me sad
I can't understand the little mistake
I'm not [?] just to give and take

It's all because of you
I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Just be, oh, it's just because, baby
Just because, just because
I love you, know I do

I keep hangin' on, just keep hangin' on
Baby, it's just because
I have to cry, it's  just because I love you
Tell the world I do

I'm trying to be one man
It's all because I love you
Tell the world I do
Let me say one thing

I keep hangin' on
Just keep hangin' on
I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Deep down in my heart
I say I love you
Tell the world I do

There's just one more thing
I gotta be

// School Days //

School days
How I wish for school days
How we used to run and play, oh baby

Now those days are gone
But we keep on going on
Wondering where they're gone
School days

I remember my love
Man, good times were easy all the time
How she really blew my mind

Oh, won't you come back to me
Oh darling, can't you see
I need you here with me always

Oh baby, let me say that it's
Easy together
Loving you whether
Whether you're near or far, oh

Now that we are
We might as well have some fun
Now that you know
Where I'm comin' from

Oh, my life is just your, your
[?] anything

Oh just come back to me
I need you desperately
Honey, won't you stay with me always

Oh, I, I want to, I want to remind her
School days, oh
I want to remind
