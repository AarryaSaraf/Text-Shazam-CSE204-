// Blow Me Down //

Well well well
Said I got another one of those days

Blow me down
It's another one of those days
Blow me down
I'm just livin' in the same old way
(You play it)

Day to day problems
I'm catchin' hell tryin' to solve 'em
Too many bills and not enough pills
For my headache, oh and time won't wait
Stayin' legal
Is hard without the eagle
Too much strife in everyone's life
And the world just turns and turns

Blow me down
It's another one of those days
Blow me down
I'm just livin' in the same old way
(You play it)
Just livin' in the same old way

There's too many heroes
And too many halos
Striving to save material things
And oh boy, where is the joy
I'm feelin' lonely
I don't wanna be phoney
What's for real and what is ideally mine

Well just blow me down, blow me down
Blow me down, blow me down
Blow, blow me down
Just blow me down
It's another, another one of those days
Blow me down, blow me, blow me down
Blow me, ooh
Let me say it again, ooh
Let me say it again, ooh
Oh say it again...

// To Sir With Love //

The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end, yeah
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To sir with love

Those schooldays are
Of telling tales, biting nails are gone, oh
But in my mind
I know that they live on and on, on and on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who had been so good to you?
Well, it's not easy, oh but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love

The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end, oh, oh
And as I leave, yeah
I know that I am leaving my best friend, oh, oh

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
Oh sir, with love, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Truth N' Time //

Only the truth can make you see
Only the truth if you love me
Only the truth put a smile on your face
Only love can take your place
But time can erase
Only truth can save our faith
Let me say

Time, time, need a little time
Only the truth and time, let me say
Time, time, need a little time
Time, time, time, oh

Only the truth can let you know
Only the truth if you love me so
Only the truth can make you see
Tell me the truth if you love me
And let me say that

Time, time, can erase
Let me say tellin' truth is our saving grace
And I said

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, let me say
Time, time, all we need is time
Oh one of these old days, they said

Time, oh can erase
All [?] that heart is
Is saved by grace

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
...

// King Of All //

Snow falling gracefully
Bright sunshine makes me believe
That it is God that keeps me alive
Though I work from day to day
I found I just can't make a way
Without the Lord, King of all

What's the matter with your mind
You have eyes and you are blind
Prayer is the way to Him
Without Him you'll never win
Don't you feel the spirit move
Tell me you're controlling you
I'd be wrong not to say
It's true light's the only way

Oh King of all, You lived for awhile
Hey King of all, You're the reason I smile
Oh King of all, You lived for awhile
Oh King of all, You're the reason I smile

Like children playing happily
Oh how happy we could be
Give your life back to the King
And He'll give you everything
Lay your burden right on down
Feel the earth go round and round
Let the Holy Spirit in
We are children of the King

King of all, you lived for awhile
Oh King of all, don't you know You're the reason I smile
Oh King of all, lived for awhile
King of all, oh you've got to be the reason
You're the reason, oh I said
King of all, King of all, King of all
King of, You're the reason, You're the reason...

// I Say A Little Prayer //

Each mornin' I wake up
Before you put on your make-up
I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you
Each day I just take time
All through your coffee-break time
I say a little prayer for you
Oh I say a little prayer for you
Let me tell you now

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While I'm ridin' I think of us
And I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you
Oh love, believe me
There is no one but you
Please love me too
Oh I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you...

// Happy Days //

Happy days are here again
Found myself a brand new friend

Oh I found a new way of giving
Oh I found a new way of living

Happy days are here
Happy ways are near
Never shed a tear
Happy days are here, oh my
It's been awhile

Oh I believe I'll try again, well well
Sing the song without an end
Keep lookin' up

Happy days are here, no no
Happy days are here
Happy days are here, yes, oh

Happy days are here
I'll never have to shed a tear
Happy times are near
You'll never have to shed a tear

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near

Oh I found a new way of giving
Oh I found a new way of living
Keep me lookin' up, hey

Happy, feelin' kind of happy
Happy, feelin' kind of happy
Smile, the smile is kind of happy
Stay happy, happy, happy
Makes me happy, we'll have to go and say
Ooh, it makes me happy, the mood...
I wonder would you dance awhile
Sing happy days are here
Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here

Feels so good to me...

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near
...
