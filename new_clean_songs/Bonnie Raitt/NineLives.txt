// No Way To Treat A Lady //

You can tease me
You can sweet-talk and lead me on
But believe me
Won't be long till I'm catchin' on

Now you left me here with nothin'
And you put my love on hold
Well there must be somethin' behind those eyes
Cuz I believed every lie you told

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't no way to treat a lady
I coulda sworn that you'd had enough

So you'd leave me
When I'm lonely and in despair
It intrigues me
How you don't really seem to care

Well I ain't here for nothin'
And my love doesn't come that cheap
I would hold you to all your promises
If I could find one you meant to keep

That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love

You can tease me
You can sweet-talk and lead me on
But believe me
Won't be long till I'm catchin' on

Cuz I ain't here for nothin'
And my love doesn't come that cheap
And I would hold you to all your promises
If I could find one you meant to keep

That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love

// Runnin' Back To Me //

Walkin' in a nightmare 
I've been burnin' in a cold sweat
There you stand lookin' for my heart
But you took it with you when you left
I don't care to hear
I don't wanna hear what you say

We had a world and a xxxx 
Yeah you really had a way with words
You kept me tied to a dream 
And I never got what I deserved
I don't care to hear
I don't wanna hear what you say
Cause I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When the nights got long 
You say you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When your luck was down
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around

[Instrumental break]

Lookin' out my window 
I remember when you drove away
I never heard you say goodbye
I gave up thinkin' you'd be here today
Well I can't hear, I don't wanna hear what you say
Cause I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When the nights got long 
You say you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
Knew you'd come back to me
When your luck was down
I know you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around

Round and round the tables turned
It's you who longs to hold me fast
Last chance was the last chance for you

[Instrumental break]

Runnin' back to me
Yeah, you come runnin' back to me
Well I knew you'd come back to me
When your nights got long
You said you missed the way it used to be
When my love was strong
I knew you'd come runnin' back to me
When your luck was down
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see
I was the best around
Best around, yeah baby
I knew you'd come runnin' back and see

// Who But A Fool (Thief Into Paradise) //

Paradise
I got man who loves me
In his life
He puts no one else above me
It's paradise
With everything I ever wanted
Paradise
It's just like love should be

Now you're a thief
Everybody I know knows it
You're indiscreet
Anybody on the street knows
That you cheat
The damage that you're doin doesn't 
Cross your mind
Steal the heart just like a thief

[Chorus]
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
Tell me, tell me, tell me who
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
Tell me, tell me
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise

You got me
Thinkin I want what you're givin
You got me
Wonderin what I'm missin
I can see
It's the same old fascination 
What a deadly game
That sends them all right into your flame

[Chorus]

// Crime Of Passion //

My body is the only place
Where we meet anymore
Thought that I could handle the heartache
Like I did before

I remember your warning
To never mention love
A little crime of passion
Is what I'm guilty of

There were no witnesses
Just the candlelight
Glowin' as your softness awakened
Every warm delight

Show me some mercy
What a fool I have become
A little crime of passion
That's what I'm sufferin' from

Kisses ago it was so easy
Dreams we shared together faded to forever
And I just don't wear despair very well
I can tell

Now is such a painful time
And I'm too far gone
Where are all the clever defenses 
I depended on?

How could I be so crazy
To believe the things you say?
A little crime of passion
Is takin' my breath away

[Instrumental break]

Show me some mercy
What a fool I have become
A little crime of passion
That's what I'm sufferin' from

Baby, oh, just a little crime of passion
Is what I'm sufferin' from
Is what I'm sufferin' from
What I'm sufferin' from
Ahhh, just a little crime of passion
Is what I'm sufferin' from

// All Day, All Night //

A little rich girl I knew was fallin' apart
(She had it all)
Lost her dreams to find a piece of his heart
(He let her fall)
Now you're on your own and it's not the same
(Oh, things do change)
There is no one there who will take the blame
You just need some time to figure it out

All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way

Take a look inside yourself and you'll find
(You still can win)
'Cause only you little girl can make up your mind
(You're your best friend)
Don't you worry 'bout that thing that you had
(You've got a chance)
You're lookin' good little girl so don't feel so bad
Spend a little time so you can figure it out

All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way, oooooh

(Take a little time, figure it out 
Take a little time, figure it out)

A little rich girl I knew was comin' around
(She's got it all)
Keep lookin' up little girl and don't you look down
Spend a little time so you can figure it out

[Repeat 2x:]
All day, all night
Your way, this is your life
All day, all night
Your way

// Stand Up To The Night //

There's a time when the light inside of us feels the night
And we're runnin', there's no place to hide
There's a time when we have to stand alone
With our eyes on a world that we never have known

Where can you run to
But somewhere inside your heart
What can you hold to
But all that you were from the start

[Chorus:]
Stand up to the night
Though it's comin' down on you
You're the only one you have
That you can hold onto
Stand up to the night
Though you're crying no one hears
If you feel your soul would light the darkness disappears
Stand up to the night

There's a time and a place in your life when you realize
That the stranger will always be there
There's a cold in the heart of the world you know
No one cares if the night comes and takes you below

Where can you run to
But somewhere inside your heart
What can you hold to
But all that you were from the start

[Chorus]

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]

// Excited //

I met you on a Monday
But Tuesday you stole my heart
You gave me everything I ever wanted
And then turned and walked away
You just turned and walked away

[Chorus:]
I get excited (excited)
Whenever you come around
I get excited
Always building me up and never letting me down
(Excited)
As simple as one, two, three
I get excited
That's what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me

(That's what you're doin', 
What you're doin')

Just when I thought I was over you
Soon as I was sure you were gone
I see you somewhere standin' 'cross the room 
But you turn and walk away
You just turn and walk away

[Chorus]

That's what you're doin'
That's what you're doin' to me

[Saxophone break]

(That's what you're doin', 
That's what you're doin')

Now that I know the problem
The answer should be easy to find
It takes common sense to simply convince him
Not to turn and walk away
Tryin' to get that man to stay

[Chorus]

That's what you're doin', 
That's what you're doin'
Hey, way to get next to me
Way to get next to me

// True Love Is Hard To Find //

You said that your love was just for me
That's why I've got to be yours
You told me the day will never come
When you would walk out and leave
'Cause you know that

[Chorus:]
True love is hard to find
'Cause you know that
True love is hard to find
Everybody knows
True love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very hard to find
I say (true love)
True love (true love)
True love (true love)
True love is hard to find

You told me that you know I would have to travel all over
You would take care of my business for me
Darlin', all I ask of you
Is to leave those business alone and save it just for me
Yes

[Chorus]

And glory fills my heart with joy from heaven
With love for you
Darlin', I always think of you
Always have my arms filled with love for you
'Cause you know that

[Chorus]

[guitar break]

[Last chorus:]
Just because I know
True love is hard to find
I believe in love
True love is hard to find
Everybody should know that
True love is hard to find
You know that
True love is hard to find
I say (true love)
True love (true love)
True love (true love)
True love is hard to find
Hard to find
True love (true love)
True love (true love)
True love is hard to find...

// Angel //

I've had my dreams
And they're all about you
What will I do with my dreaming?
And I've had my schemes
And it seems that they'll get me through
But will I do without you?

Angel, tell me what will I do
Sailing alone without you?
I know you have made your plans
Angel, now what will you see 
Sailing alone without me?
Angel, tell me what will you see
Sailing alone without me?

[Guitar break]

Sailing alone without me
Angel, tell what will you see
Sailing alone without me?

[Guitar for the rest of song]
