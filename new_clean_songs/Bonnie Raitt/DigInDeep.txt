// Unintended Consequence Of Love //

Looks like we've been buttin' heads again, baby
Lately seems like all we ever do.
Can't remember when things got so crazy,
All I know's I don't know what to do...

I guess we oughta stop and think it over.
Decide if what we want there's enough of.
It's tearing us apart, it cuts right to the heart
It's an unintended consequence of love.

Remember how we fell into each other, baby
Was all we could do to get up out of bed
You used to say nobody loved you better
I used to hang on every word you said.

What happened to those brave and tender lovers?
How could we break the mighty promise of?
I guess time wore us down, expectations run aground,
It's an unintended consequence of love

Now baby, I'm the one that's takin' chances.
I know we've got a love worth fighting for.
Let's drop the petty games and pick up dancin'
Get back to where we're wanting nothing more

I'm calling on you, baby, now or never
Let's dig in deep and get out of this rut
We'll get back to what brought us both together, baby
and find a way to resurrect out strut

Cause baby, you're my brave and tender lover
I know we'll find the mighty promise of
So come on, baby, back
We'll get this love on track
You're my one intended consequence of love

// Need You Tonight //

All you got is this moment
Twenty-first century's yesterday
Can care all you wanna, baby
Everybody does yeah that's okay

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
Something about you, boy
That makes me sweat

How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't take it all
What you gonna do?
Gonna live my life

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping, boy
There's something about you, baby
That makes me sweat

How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't take it all
What you gonna do?
Gonna live my life

I'm lonely

// I Knew //

Time, time ain't never healed the wound
Can't think of anything that gets
Any better 'cause it's old

Change, change would prob'ly do me good
Wouldn't prob'ly hurt a thing
Anyway, that's what I'm told

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

Stop, stop and take a better look
There ain't no telling what you'll find
In the corner of a darkened room

Things, things that either one time fell
Or blew down from a windowsill
Or never got up by the broom

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

No two ways about it, it's a doggone shame
Baby, it's a doggone shame

I would have run, but I couldn't run
Would have flown, but I couldn't fly
I woulda headed right back into town
I woulda lied, but I couldn't lie
'Cause I knew

// All Alone With Something To Say //

Like a heartbeat, timing is everything
I took a look at love when love looked away
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say

I've been thinking, tweaking, and rethinking
All the things that I would tell you someday
I can hear it while I'm sitting here
All alone with something to say

I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I should be writing a column to the people
On how not to let your love life slip away
It would be clever, witty, and titled
All alone with something to say

I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry

All the nuggets of gold on my tongue
Pearls of wisdom coming in waves
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say
All alone with something to say

// What You're Doin' To Me //

Above the fray, my heart got tucked away
And I finally found some peace
I lost the taste for it, the pain and the waste of it
Love just wasn't meant for me

Just when I thought the coast was finally clear
You come bustin' in the door and pull me outta here
Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Honey, I ain't lyin', 'cause baby feels so good to me

I pulled in tight, pushed back with all my might
And still you couldn't get enough

My last defense is slippin' out of reach
You got me where you want me, now I'm fallin' into the breach
Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Ain't no use in tryin', 'cause baby you're so good to me

After all that Sturm and Drang I gave up long ago
One too many times around and nothin' left to show
You got that somethin', baby, that shakes me to the core
Pulled me straight out by the roots and got me holl'in more

Just goes to show, no way you'll ever know
What love's got up her sleeve
You think the game's up, headin' home and guess what?
She shows up with a sweet reprieve
No use in wonderin' if it's real or if it's not
With nothin' left to lose you might as well give it a shot

Now there's no denyin', baby, what you're doin' to me
Ain't no use in tryin', 'cause baby, we were meant to be

// Shakin' Shakin' Shakes //

The wind blows through the valley
It's warm and hard and wild
It gets all up inside the trees and shakes the leaves all night
They shake up through the mountains
They shake up to the sky
They shake up to the moon above and then it starts to shine

And Lord it makes me tremble
Lord it makes me tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Baby, shakin' and shakin', shakes

A fault runs through the valley as long as it is mean
It starts to tear into the earth and gets all in between
It shakes up through the mountains
It shakes down to the sea
It shakes up to the volcano and then it starts to scream

And Lord it makes me tremble
Lord it makes me tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

There's a woman in this valley
She's sweet as she is rough
And when she starts to dance that way
She shakes the boys all up
She shakes it through the mountain
She shakes it through the night
She shakes it like a hurricane
She gives a blind man sight

And Lord it makes them tremble
Oh Lord it makes them tremble

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Baby, shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes
Shakin' and shakin', shakes

Shake that thing, baby, shake it!

// Undone //

There's a sword at the tip of my tongue
That shows no mercy on the latest one
And I was wrong with all my might
I took you out in one last round tonight

And there's no more shouting and no more tears
Just the fatal words ringing in our ears
And in the silence it's crystal clear
There's no undoing what is happened here

We've come undone
We've come undone
Battle waged, nothing won
Oh what have I done
The blood has run
Some things can't be undone

We hurt the ones we love the most
A thousand memories go up in smoke
And in the morning when ashes fall
There'll be no need for any words at all

We've come undone
We've come undone
Battle waged, nothing won
What have I done
The blood has run
Some things can't be undone

There's no joy in victory
When it comes at your defeat

Oh we've come undone
Lord, what have I done
Some things can't be undone

// If You Need Somebody //

I hate to see you bummin', but boy, I saw it comin'
That girl just wasn't meant for you
I see you goin' through 'em, and nothin' I can do
And I could kick myself for not tellin' you

The way I feel about you, held back so long

If you need somebody
To be the one to see you through
If you want somebody
Who knows you just the way I do
If you're tired of searchin', baby
And your heart's about to run aground
Only got to turn around
'Cause I've been waiting

Never could have guessed it, best friends
Since we were kids, but now I
Lose it every time that you're near
With every new dead end, it's gettin' harder to pretend
When I know all you need is standin' right here

The way I feel about you, held back so long

If you need somebody
To be the one to see you through
If you want somebody
Who understands you like I do

If you're tired of searchin', baby
And your heart's about to run aground
Only got to turn around

And when you're all alone and your heart keeps saying
You just can't take it
Just take a look around and you just might find
I'm a chance worth takin'

The way I feel about you, a love so strong

If you need somebody
To be the one to see you through
If you want somebody
To understand you like I do

If you're tired of searchin', baby
And your heart's about to run aground
Only got to turn around
'Cause I've been waiting

// Gypsy In Me //

Well, that highway moon is calling 
like some lover from some other land
Before the dust can settle, 
I'll kick it up and tear it down again

I've got the wanderlust
It's somewhere else or bust
Yeah, I'm just a

Hello, goodbye, honey
It's been good and I must be going
Restless, I guess
When I'm in one place for too long
I don't know why
But I'm like the wind and I just keep blowing free
Must be the gypsy in me, yeah
Gypsy in me

So I led on the table
Baby, what you get is what you see, ooh
Well, you can look there in the palm of my hand
You won't find a line of longevity

No, it ain't in the cards
I ain't no queen of hearts
Before it starts, uh

Hello, goodbye, honey
It's been good and I must be going
Restless, I guess
When I'm in one place for too long
I don't know why
But I'm like the wind and I just keep blowing free
Must be the gypsy in me, yeah
Gypsy in me, ooh
(Gypsy in me)

I've got the wanderlust
It's somewhere else or bust
Yeah, I'm just a

Hello, goodbye, honey
It's been good and I must be going
Restless, I guess
When I'm in one place for too long
I don't know why
But I'm like the wind and I just keep blowing free
Must be the gypsy in me, yeah
Gypsy in me, yeah
Gypsy in me
Gypsy in me, yeah

Oh
Gypsy in me, yeah
Oh
Gypsy in me, yeah
Oh
Gypsy in me
Oh
Gypsy in me
Oh, oh
Hey, yeah, yeah

// The Comin' Round Is Going Through //

You got a way of running your mouth
You rant and you rave, you left it all out
The thing about it, little that you say is true
Why bother checkin', the facts will be damned
It's how you spin it, it's part of the plan
Well I'm here to tell you honey that
Your sicken loan is coming due

Only so long you can keep this charade
Until they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through

You say it's workin', it's tricklin' down
Yeah, there's a trick, 'cause the jobs ain't around
From where you're sittin' tell me how you think you possibly know?
The way it feels to get turned away
Never enough, it's day after day
Yank that by your bootstraps
'Cause that's the way it really goes

Only so long you can keep this charade
Before they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
Comin' round is going through
The comin' round is going through

'Cause when the moneys makin' money, it comes down to a few
They got their hands on the throttle and nobody gets through
You can work all your life for a hand that will play
With one role of the dice it gets swept away
Just look around, things are startin' to slip
You're outta control and you're losin' your grip
No way to stop it, cause that river's spillin' over for good
We don't have the answer, we know what it's not
'Cause the people will keep pushin' until they all get a shot
Your money's no good here, we wouldn't cash you a check if we could

Only so long you can keep this charade
Before they wake up and see they've been played
Too many people with their livin' at stake
Ain't gonna take it
The comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Comin' round is going through
Quit that, baby!
Is going through
Is going through

// You've Changed My Mind //

I'd hidden away
The pains of the day
And the strain of my eyes to see
The grain of my skin
At the start of the end
Of all I once thought I could be

The page has been bent
Like an ear, and I've spent
Too much just to straighten a line
But you've waited as still
As the stone of my will
And I know you've changed my mind
And I know you've changed my mind

The beast in this room
Paces and moons
He's restless and needs to be fed
He moves in for keeps
At the first sign of sleep
He groans and he nuzzles my head

I gave nearly all
To building the wall
That could hide me forever behind
But now even my doubt
Seems to know a way out
And I know you've changed my mind
And I know you've changed my mind

How little I knew
Tree that I grew
Was not just to root me down
Might stand to wave
When the passing of days
Begged for a view off the ground

My faith had grown cold
And all I'd been told
Convinced me that just comes with time
But a page has been turned
Some old fears unlearned
And I know you've changed my mind
And I know you've changed my mind

// The Ones We Couldn't Be //

It's hard to say now who left first, it used to seem so clear
You and I were tangled from the start
Somehow the scales just fell away and I'm left standing here
Blown open in the hole that was my part

I wrap the dark around me, there's no solace here tonight
Just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways we tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones we couldn't be

Looking through these photographs searching for a clue
How you and I got tangled from the start
Not even blood could forge a bond enough to get us through
Or stem the tides that pulled us far apart

I'm sorry for the ways I couldn't give you what you needed
For all the ways I strung us both along
They say it goes both ways and I suppose I could concede it
Seems to matter more now that you're gone

And though it seems much kinder just to leave some things unsaid
Like all the ways I tore myself apart
If you really want forgiveness, you better try the truth instead
It may not be enough, but it's a start

I wrap the dark around me and there's no solace here tonight
There's just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways we tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones
Sorry for the ones
I'm sorry for the one I couldn't be
