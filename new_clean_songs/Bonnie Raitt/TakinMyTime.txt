// You've Been In Love Too Long //

Girls, you've been in love too long
I said girls, you've been in love too long
When just his smile takes all your pain away
And you find yourself believin' whatever he may say
Now when he gets you cryin'
But your heart tells you Girl keep right on tryin'
You know Girls, you've been in love too long

[Chorus:] You're a fool for your baby
[Bonnie:] Girls, you've been in love too long
[Chorus:] You're a fool for your baby

When you accepted wrongs, just to share his kiss
Even your lonely nights, you know they're filled with happiness
You know Girl you're in trouble
You know your... heart is seein' double

Cuz when you're head tells you to run
But your heart tells you "Girl he's the only one.."
You know you have:been in love too long

Cuz when a week of loneliness can be erased with just one sweet caress
Girl... You've been in love too long
When his wrong looks right though he always treats you bad
You find little excuses for all the sadness and abuses

// I Gave My Love A Candle //

I gave my love a candle
A promise at life
And I told him when my number comes up
Winds would fill the sky
Me I'm fixin' to die
Moving down that same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me
You didn't have to lie
My love comes around like a thief in the night
But only love can make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your love was like a diamond ride a wave
On a sea that calms my mind
Moving onward to a distant shore
Where the boats sail in a line
We have danced to a fateful rhyme
Moving down the same lonesome road
No I don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You didn't have to fool me, no
You didn't have to lie
If it all came out so ugly
It's only my love that could make you cry
And we have walked side by side
Moving down that same lonesome road
And I still don't know why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Ooh ooh ooh
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

// Let Me In //

Let me in

I can see the dancin', (let me in).
The silhouettes on the shade (silhouettes).
I hear the music (music),
All the lovers on parade (oh).
Open up (let me in), I wanna come in again,
I thought you were my friend.

Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet.
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat.
Jumpin' and stompin' on the flo-o-o-o-oor.
(Lemme in ) Let me in! (Open up.) Open up!
Why won't you open up that door? (Let me in.)

I hear (open up) music let me in (music).
I wanna come in again.
Let me in (let me in), a-well I heard it just then.
I thought you were my friend.

Pitter patter of those feet.
Movin' and a-groovin' with that beat.
Jumpin' and stompin' on the floor.
(Lemme in.) Let me in!. (Open up.) Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? (Let me in.)

I-ah-I (open up) hear music, let me in (music).
Oh, I heard it just then. Let me in. (Let me in.)
I wanna come in again
I thought you were my friend

// Everybody's Cryin' Mercy //

I don't believe the things I'm seein'
I've been wonderin' 'bout some things I've heard
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word

A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as soon as there's business first

Toe to toe, touch and go
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir

Well you know the people running round in circles
Don't know what they're headed for
Everybody's crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war

Straight ahead, gotta knock em dead
So pack your kit, choose your own hypocrite

You don't have to go to off-broadway
To see something plain absurd
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word

Nobody knows the meaning of the word

// Cry Like A Rainstorm //

Life isn't easy
Love never lasts
You just carry on
And keep moving fast

I turned off the highway
Pulled into town
I'm fancy free darlin'
And I've travelled round

Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Tell me where can I run to
Tell me how have I sinned
When you cry like a rainstorm
And howl like the wind

So who shall I start with
Tell me how to begin
When you cry like a rainstorm
And howl like the wind

My thoughts are lost in memories
That keep me free
Know if all the stars were shining
They would not help me see

Don't you know that
Sometimes I'm up
Most times down
Where can I run to
Tell me how have I sinned
You cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind

Well my life isn't easy
And my love never seems to last
So I'll keep on carrying on darlin'
I'll just keep moving fast

I turned off the highway
Pulled into town
And I'm still fancy free
And I keep travellin' round

Sometimes I'm up
Most times I'm down
Where can I run to
Tell me how have I sinned
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind

So who shall I start with
Tell me how to begin
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind

Cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind

// Wah She Go Do //

I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
I could understand why a woman must have an outside man
A man just wants to run like rat and have his wife to abide by that
Every night he's havin a ball and when he reach home he ain't touching his wife at all

And if the woman says she's feelin' sexy (Wah She Go Do)
And the man says he's feelin' sleepy (Wah She Go Do)
If you have a husband give him plenty of position
If he starts runnin just laugh don't say anything

An she's bawlin' "C'mon Doo doo" but this time it soft like soft candle
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside man
If he picks up an outside woman show him you can pick up two outside men
An that's the only way a woman should get some respect today

Every woman they want and usin' we as a convenience
Then they turn an' say they can't trust a woman today
For days he ain't seen his home; the man goes and leave his wife all alone
At the end when his head is bald; they go and don't know a woman never phone at all

An' if the man say "Lie down on de bed" ( Wah She Go Do)
Then the man lays down as if he's dead (Wah She Go Do)
An she wantin' water in she tank. Yet de man so damn disobedient
No satisfaction! So you see a woman must have an outside man

// I Feel The Same //

Say goodbye,
Well I know it's true.
I know you're leaving me but i,
I'm leaving too.
You won't forget me,
Or the sound of my name.
Please believe me,
I feel the same.

It seems so empty now.
Clo-ose the door.
Ain't it hard to believe that you ever,
Lived this way before.
All that nothing,
Causes all that pain.
Please believe me,
I feel the same.

[Guitar break]

Well this broken soul,
That I know a, a heart that's breakin'.
You can't make it whole
Until you know what has been taken.
And all those pieces,
Uh that you find them all your own.
[Guitar fills in the missing tag lyric]

I said goodbye.
Now you know it's true.
You said you're leaving me, but honey i,
I'm leaving too.
You won't forget me
Or the sound of my name.
Please believe me,
I feel the same.
Please believe me,
I feel the same.

[Guitar break, and fade]

// I Thought I Was A Child //

It's such a clever innocence with which you do your sorcery
As if somehow the years just bow and let that young girl go free
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled
I thought I knew where I was going until I heard your laughter flowing
And came upon the wisdom in your eyes
Surprise

I've spent my whole life running 'round
Chasing songs from town to town
Thinking I'd be free so long as I never let love slow me down
So lonely and so wild until you turned and smiled
By now I should have long been gone
But here I am still looking on
As if I didn't know which way to run

It's such a clever innocence with which you show myself to me
As if you know how it feels to never be who you wanted to be
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled
I thought that I was free but I'm just one more prisoner of time
Alone within the boundaries of my mind
I thought I was a child

// Write Me A Few Of Your Lines / Kokomo Blues //

When you get home baby
Write me a few of your lines
When you get home little baby
Write me a few of your lines
That'll be consolation
Lord honey oh my worried mind

Left my baby
Standin' in the backdoor cryin'
Well I left my little baby
Standing in the backdoor cryin'
I never felt so sorry
Lord honey till he said goodbye

Kokomo me baby
Kokomo me right
Kokomo your mama,
She'll be back tomorrow night
I'd like to cry in your arms tonight
Baby don't you wanna go?
Right on to lemon light city
Sweet home kokomo

Go on down to the river baby
Goin' to sit down on the ground
Well I'm goin' down to the river baby
Goin' to sit down on the ground
And let the way of the water
Lord honey wash my troubles down

Kokomo me baby
Kokomo me right
Kokomo your mama,
She'll be back tomorrow night
I gotta cry with you baby
Baby don't you wanna go?
Right on to lemon light city
Sweet home kokomo

// Guilty //

Yeah baby, I've been drinking,
And I shouldn't come by I know
But I found myself in trouble darling,
And I had nowhere else to go

Got some whiskey from a bar man,
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on moving,
Till I was back in your arms again

Well I'm guilty, yeah I'm guilty,
I'll be guilty for the rest of my life
How come I never do,
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing that I try to do ever turns out right

Well you know how it is with me baby,
You know I just can't stand myself
It takes a whole lot of medicine,
For me to pretend to be somebody else.
