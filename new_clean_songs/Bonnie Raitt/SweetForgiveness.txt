Album: SweetForgiveness

// About To Make Me Leave Home //

Never thought that a love could be so strong
It could ever make me, think about leaving home
I can't help myself your lovin bout to drive me mad
One more night like last night, I might have to pack my bags
Bout to make me leave home boy

Got my mind so
Gettin together with this love, boy it just ain't right
I ain't got the strength to turn a good lovin loose
But I never met a man in my life who could whoop it to me like you do

Bout to make me leave home boy

Got a taste of forbidden fruit
And I can't turn it loose
What is this good thing you carry around with you
That makes a girl want to act a fool

Got that love technique that really really cracks me up
Seeing you once or twice a week, boy it just ain't enough.

// Runaway //

As I walk along I wonder what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as still walk on I think of the things we've done
Together while our hearts were young

I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder
Why, why why why why why she (you) ran away
And I wonder where she (you) will stay
My little runaway, a run run run run runaway

// Two Lives //

Maybe I'm a dreamer
Maybe just a fool
Lately I can hardly see the sun
If you had a secret I could take a guess
Nothin in your eyes seems to hold me
Truth or consequences
Which one will it be

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song,
Never had a broken heart

One of us is hiding
One of us can tell
Cause no one likes to be the first to know
Someone has to answer
Cause someone has to ask
Keeping on like this is torture
And going undecided is twice as bad for sure

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has torn apart
But, I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart

// Louise //

They all said Louise was not half bad
It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act, the little girl
The deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade

Sometimes a bottle of perfume
Flowers, and maybe some lace
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced

Everybody thought it kind of sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd all put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon

Louise rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south, I heard them say
"Too bad it ended so ugly
Too bad she had to go that way"

But the wind is blowin' cold tonight
Goodnight, Louise, goodnight

// Gamblin' Man //

Their eyes are down and the track looks slow
It don't look like a good thing
Your horse could jump it when the pack runs wild
It don't look like a sure thing

You must be crazy
To gamble this way
The kids are crying
And your bills ain't paid
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool
I must be crazy to gamble on you

The deal is done so you slip right in
You got the depth but you can't win
The cards are cold and the cut feels thin
You got the deck but you can't win

You must be crazy
To gamble this way
The kids are hungry
And your brain ain't paid
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool
I must be crazy to gamble on you
Gamblin' man, you're a ramblin' fool
I must be crazy to gamble on you

// Sweet Forgiveness //

Yeah, well... 

When will I learn
To take you on my journey
When will I see, yeah
That you belong to me
When will I learn
To take you on my journey
When will I see, yeah
That you belong with me?

Sweet forgiveness
How could you go, my babe
I never really knew that I needed you
But you were right there
Understand me, yeah
Honey you set my sails
When will I learn to take you with me
Everywhere?
When will I learn...?  

(Sweet forgiveness)
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine

Hey...

Did you ever get lost
In a bundle of nerves
Did you ever get lost
In a jungle of your own words
You hurt another, hurt a brother
You hurt a sister or a lover
And then you go 'right'
Then you got to just sit back
And wait for the cure

Sweet forgiveness
How can you go, my babe
I never really knew that I needed you
But you were right there
Understand me, yeah
Honey you set my sails
When will I learn to take you with me
Everywhere?
When will I learn...?

(Sweet forgiveness)
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine  
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than honey
Give me that
Sweet forgiveness
Sweeter than wine...

// My Opening Farewell //

Baby stands before an open window
Looking so far away
He can almost feel the Southern winds blow
Gently touching his restless day

He turns from his window to me
Sad smile, his apology
Sad eyes reaching to the door
Did I lose to his to another evening
Still he spares me the words goodbye
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind
So I'm offering these to him as if to be kind
There's a train every day
Leaving either way
There's a world you know
There's a way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawings left there on the table
And a womans silk is laying on the floor
I would keep them here if were able
To lock you safe behind this open door

Suddenly it's so clear to me
That I asked you to see what you may never see
Now my kind words find their way back to me

There's a train everyday
Leaving either way
There's a world you know
Gotta way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell
This is my opening farewell

// Three Time Loser //

How many teardrops gonna fall tonight
How many heartaches can a woman have in one life

I lost a lover, lost a friend
Through with love I just can't win

[Chorus:]
Three time loser
Three time loser

How many hours, your love I'm gonna wait?
How many heartaches you really think I'm gonna take?

I lost a lover, lost a friend,
You were that kind, whoa You will never win.

[Chorus]

One
Two
Three
In misery

[Chorus]

// Takin' My Time //

I'm takin' my time
So please don't rush me.
Tryin' to sort out some things I didn't know existed.
I've been here before,
I know where the traps lie.
You only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter.

Well I'm tired of talk,
So please don't push me.
You know I want the same kinda things that you do.
You're wasting your time,
The way you come to me.
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason

Can't make things move any faster,
By second wishing them to death.
You seem to be living on the level.
It's decent enough,
You got what you wanted.
So why do you tell me, that I'm on the wrong track?
I'm doin' the best I can do.

I try to out guess
The situation
That I know your not even fully aware of.
And I want you to know,
If it keeps on this way,
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.

// Home //

Traveling at night, the headlights were bright
And we'd been up many an hour
All through my brain
Came the refrain
Of home and its warming fire

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen
They come in between
The city's a tiring life
And the trains come and go
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

Traveling at night,
The headlights were bright.
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend
The flowers will send
The sweet smell of home in the breeze

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still
