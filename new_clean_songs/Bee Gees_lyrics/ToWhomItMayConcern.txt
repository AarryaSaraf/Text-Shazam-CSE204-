// Run To Me //

If ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And let it be like they said it could be
Me loving you girl, and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you, and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

// We Lost The Road //

We must have lost the road
Don't you think it's getting late
Maybe if it's colder
We can stop and wait

We must have lost the words
All the little things we said
And now the world is frozen
Only you in my head

Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

We must have lost the tune
Where did I step out of line
I'll search for the melody
That calls you mine

Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road
Oh, we lost the road

// Never Been Alone //

I've never been alone
And I've only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why
I've been thinking it over

I've never climbed a tree
But that's natural for me
And you don't know my name
So I'm thinking it over

And every day I'm learning
The things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me
You'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me

Never rode a plane
And I never will again
So 'til then I'll drink the rain
While I'm thinking it over

And every day I'm learning
The things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me
You'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me

Never rode a plane
And I never will again
So 'til then I'll drink the rain
While I'm thinking it over

// Paper Mache, Cabbages & Kings //

Na na na na na na na na na
Paper mache and telegraph poles
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books, people you don't meet
Haven't got a bed to lay my head, shoes to fit my feet

Don't be scared
You're better off than nothing
You're answering to no one
Paper mache

Paper mache and telegraph poles
Thing go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books, people you don't meet
Haven't got a bed to lay my head, shoes to fit my feet

Don't be scared
You're better off than nothing
You're answering to no one
Paper mache

All of a sudden it happened
When you did what you said you'd do
And you broke my heart in two
Like paper mache
All of a sudden it happened, oh
You came into my life
Like paper mache you broke my heart
Like paper mache, paper mache
Like paper mache

Paper mache and telegraph poles
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you wanna jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books
People you don't meet

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went "Bang!"
Jimmy was everywhere

Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went "Bang!"
Jimmy was everywhere

Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went "Bang!"
Jimmy was everywhere

// I Can Bring Love //

I can make the sun shine out of the heavens
Sweet love, love you forever
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got

I can change the whole world if you are near me
No tears if you can hear me
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah
Just wait until the sun's on your pillow
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
Yeah, yeah, yeah

// I Held A Party //

I held a party and nobody came
Strangely I was upset
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached
Saying, "Have no regrets

Maybe your gentle friends had some delay
Don't try and take on the world."

True

Made up my bed and decided to sleep
Dreaming I was awake
Maybe I drank in excess of my drink
Nice clan cordial crowd

Birkworth suggested we speak through the night
I never knew him so well

Ah ah ah

// Please Don't Turn Out The Lights //

Every time I need reality, yeah
In jeopardy of losing all of me

I just am not stronger
Life don't last so long so baby

If you turned out the lights
If you turned out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

Baby, I don't feel too reliable
I can only do what I'm liable

But if you want to leave me
Love me and just leave me baby

Turn out the lights

// Sea Of Smiling Faces //

Yesterday was history who knows
What there is gonna be when we meet again?
Will you smile and tell the world about me?
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend?

As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

I remember things we planned
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me
Each moment is a memory, whatever they say

As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

Yesterday was history who knows
What there is gonna be when we meet again?
Will you smile and tell the world about me?
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend?

For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

// Bad Bad Dreams //

I've got a notion to live in an ocean of bad bad dreams
No consolation to mixed conversation in bad bad dreams
You know we're all alike
We can shout and scream and yell all night
It's just a bad bad dream

Feel like I'm crying
There's no use denying it's all been done
For your information we still own the nation
The war's been won
You know you're far too late
Your only hangup is you hesitate
It's just a bad bad dream

Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream

I'm getting it to you so you get it through you and make your choice
People start playing and back what you're saying
It's just one voice
You know you're all insane
It doesn't matter how you play the game
It's just a bad bad dream

Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream

// You Know It's For You //

I will die for you
I have cried for you, believe me girl

Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
All my love's for you
All I do's for you
Still I think it's time you made up your own mind

A melody, my symphony
You know it's for you, love
It's plain to see, it's meant to be
Now it's up to you, love

Still I'll wait for you
Waiting just for you, don't leave me girl

Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
Love is here for you
Love was made for you, believe me girl
Don't you think it's time you gave up?
You are mine

La da da la dee da dee da-ee-a-ee-a-ee-a-ee-ah
La da da la dee da dee da-ee-a-ee-a-ee-a-ee-ah

Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you

// Alive //

Maybe you talk too high, man
Maybe I talk too slow
But you've got to live a little bit faster
'Cause you've got a little less time to go

I ain't lost and I ain't searching
But then you know me very well
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way
I'm a fool and I can tell

That I'm alive and that's all
That I can get up just as fast as I fall
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl
And in the end it doesn't matter at all
I don't know about the people that I read about in books
And the kings and queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive

I ain't lost and I ain't searching
But then you know me very well
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way
I'm a fool and I can tell

That I'm alive and that's all
That I can get up just as fast as I fall
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl
And in the end it doesn't matter at all
I don't know about those people that I read about in books
And the kings and queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive, alive

// Road To Alaska //

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I ain't got no Honey
I'm so short of money
I really really wanna go home

I dialed Oklahoma
Made attempts to phone her
Gave up when I got no reply

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I don't ask her I'll die

I found Cincinnati, out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to running
I couldn't really make her my wife
She started to show which way she was going
Every single road she could go

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I made Cincinnati
Out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to running
I couldn't really make her my wife
She started to show which way she was going
Every single road she could go
I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know

// Sweet Song Of Summer //

La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da

I can feel you sweet song of summer
Your music comforts my lonely reign
I can hear you in evil darkness
That empty feelings, I'm near you again

I am yours forever and this I emphasize
Your never-ending hurting and criticize

La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da
La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da

We are friends forever and this I emphasize
Your never-ending hurting and criticize

La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da
La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da
La da da da, da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da
