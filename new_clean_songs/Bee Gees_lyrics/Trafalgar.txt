// How Can You Mend A Broken Heart? //

I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

And, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

La la la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la

Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da da, da

// Israel //

You've had your troubles, Israel
I've seen them all
But you put the writing on the wall
Israel, Israel, yeah

You know I've seen you fall so many times
I've cried for you and that's a crime
Israel, Israel, Israel

Where there's sand
Where there's beautiful sand yeah
You know you got a kind of feeling
That's just grand
Take me into your arms
Let me be with you
Israel, Israel, Israel

I like the smiles up on your people's faces
They make you feel warm embraces
And I want that kind of smile
That kind of smile
Israel, you make the whole world think about you
And if they don't they'll find a reason
To shout about Israel, Israel

You're the only one, Israel, Israel
Tell me all about it!
Tell me all about it
Tell me all about it
Oh take me into your arms
And make me feel your goodness
Be with me, Israel
Hey hey hey hey
Oh oh oh
Take me into your arms
Let me hold hold you to myself
Oh I want to, Israel

Israel, oh take me back into into your arms
Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel
Israel

// The Greatest Man In The World //

Before I heard your voice
I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it 'til I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl

Before I saw your face
I never saw a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it 'til I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I've got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
The greatest girl

Be the greatest man in the world
Oh, be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man, the greatest man in the world
The greatest man, be the greatest man in the world

// It's Just The Way //

It's just the way that I feel about tomorrow
I'll be sad and alone all the time
It's just the way that you said you don't love me anymore then 'Goodbye'
I can't believe what you're saying
You don't love me anymore. 'Goodbye'

Just the way that I feel about tomorrow
Knowing you won't be there by my side
I wish that I could say to you, "Well, can't we just be good friends?
Would you leave the door open? Let me walk in again?"

That's the way I've been thinking 'bout tomorrow
I only know that friends can't be lovers again

// Remembering //

I never really want to be alone
I had a woman once in my life
But now she's flown
Every night I keep seeing her face

I never really broke her heart
She was a part of me
But that's the way it was
Now we live separately
When will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces but now I feel as good as if I were dead

I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering

I first set my eyes on you one cold February
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine
Oh, but when will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces, now I feel as good, as good as if I were dead

I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering

// Somebody Stop The Music //

I arise, try to see my face through my disguise
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

I arose, the truth will out the more it grows
It's not a mystery, no one was hiding it from me
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya

Yeah, today I saw the sun, the sun

// Trafalgar //

I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
Why haven't I been told?
I need someone to know me and to show me
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down

Ten hundred people roam through the place I call my home
I need someone to know me and to show me
Sitting cross-legged on my own and yet I'm not alone
Don't need no one to show me
No one owns me
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar
Trafalgar, Trafalgar, Trafalgar, please don't let me down

Trafalgar [repeat and fade out]

// Don't Wanna Live Inside Myself //

I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel

I went walking through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe in the falling rain

In the morning
Bury me down by the river
Saved by the bell
Man for all seasons

// When Do I //

Tell me if dreams do come true
If so, then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in

Tell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
And when do I and when do I
When do I
When do I know if I fit in?

// Dearest //

I hear you calling me 'dearest' too
My dearest, I'm nearest than I've ever been before
To have you calling me 'dearest' once more
My dearest, this picture, my own memory
Wishing this picture was reality

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away
And if you could see me today
I will remember you
I will remember you
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you
And here in my heart you're my dearest too

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away
And if you could see me today
I will remember you
I will remember you
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you
And here in my heart you're my dearest too

// Lion In Winter //

Lion in my winter
I'm a lion with no crown

You wanna make me big, man, a star on a screen
Some kind of James Brown or something in-between
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms
I can't live on glory when you're bendin' both my arms

I, I was a lion in winter
And, man, I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion, Lord, without a crown?

You're living in a cave, man, upon your marble throne
You think you own the heavens, but you've got to be alone
You know I prayed for sunshine, a woman with my name
I don't want to live, man, you gave away the game

I, I was a lion in winter
And, man, I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion, Lord, without a crown?

I, I was a lion in winter
And, man, I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion, Lord, without a crown?

// Walking Back To Waterloo //

I wish there was another year, another time
When people sang and poems rhymed
Mm, my name could be Napoleon

A thousand ships, a windy sail
So huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky
It's beautiful, but hard to find
But I just wasn't born in time

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

I can dream of growing trees
And things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen

(Oh, tell me)
What is life when a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right?
And I don't know what it means
There must be more we haven't seen

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end
