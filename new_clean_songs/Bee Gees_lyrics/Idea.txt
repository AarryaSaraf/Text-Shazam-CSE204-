// Let There Be Love //

Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue
Let there be life
So everyone lives to love
Let it happen to me and you

I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

I can be nothing
Or I can be something
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living
Without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
I never begged, but I'm begging now

Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue, oh yeah
Let there be life
So we can all live to love
And let it be both of us

I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

// Kitty Can //

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

When kitty smiles, the world stands still
I see a thousand golden daffodils
But when she cries, the world just dies
I see a million tears in kitty's eyes

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel
She loves to see me looking like a fool
I find a way with words I say
To be in love in such a lonely way

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

Now they are two and I am one
I cannot fall in love with everyone
So I must choose between the two
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

// In The Summer Of His Years //

In the summer of his years
He would always smile
He would laugh every day
If he was here to stay
For the summer of his years

In the daylight of his dreams
He would save his tears
He would always hear
When there was no one near
For the summer of his years

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
For the summer of his years
For the summer of his years

// Indian Gin And Whisky Dry //

All day, all night
You feel as if the earth could fly
Three more all for fine
Indian gin and whisky dry
Fine Indian gin and whisky dry

Small town, closed down, there's nowhere else around to try
Disturbingly a voice would cry
"Go home, no loan, you'll have you gin and whisky dry
You'll have your gin and whisky dry"

Four, ten, four men, lining up for their handy brandy
All's gone, you're none, came the bartender's reply
But I've tried and I'm tied
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry

// Down To Earth //

Hello there. Is there any air? Can you slow me down?
Can you believe that what you see could never ever be so real somehow
Down to earth, my merry men
There's some help needed here and you're there
You can see if you stand on your chair
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like

Hello there. Do you really care? Have you time to learn?
Could you believe that what you read
One thousand pages couldn't tell you why
Down to earth, my merry men
There's some help needed here and you're there
You can see if you stand on your chair
That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like you

That there's millions and millions and
Millions and millions of people like you

// Such A Shame //

All that I hear doesn't feel right
Don't call me 'til you're all right
I listened and I heard but don't tell me
La de da

Once in a while he says good night
Will I care if sometimes he is right?
What a shame, it's the same each day
La de da

Oh how I tried!
I just sat and then I cried
Maybe I'm wrong or will I find out when I'm gone?
There is so much fun in my leisure
Don't bother me, man, just stay there
If it's a sin, I'll convert me astray
La de da

Come be home with me
It's not a shame for you to see
Oh
Let it be and you'll miss reality

// I've Gotta Get A Message To You //

The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said, "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone."

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart, then won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life, I'm alone
And I gotta let her know just in time before I go

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

Well I laughed, but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying, but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die

I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on

I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on

// Idea //

I been thinking sitting on a pole
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told
Just me and the mirror and my brain
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?

Fifteen years I lay down on the ground
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound
Fifteen million years I spent down the line
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?
Get up and stand alone

That was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?
Get up and stand alone

That's when I got an idea
That's when I got an idea

// When The Swallows Fly //

I wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Ain't nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybody's got a destiny

And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me

I'll look after number one
I'll forget the beggar's son
Everybody's got to stay alive
I'll keep a-walking amongst the clouds
I'll keep my head above the crowd
I'll watch them live, I'll watch them die

And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me

And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Yes I know when the swallow flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies

// I Have Decided To Join The Airforce //

Mother, I'm going to join the Air Force today
I don't care what the neighbors may say
But I'm going to join the Air Force today

Mother, I don't care what my father might think
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink
But I don't care what my father might think
Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right
Don't ask me why, it's my mind
It's better, it's better than being alone
Alone on the ground. Now I find

Mother, I've got to join the Air Force you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea

Mother, I've got to join the Air Force you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better then joining the army or going to sea
Mother, Mother, Mother

// I Started A Joke //

I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me, oh no

I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah
That the joke was on me

Oh no, that the joke was on me, oh

// Kilburn Towers //

I am a bird; watch me go drifting by
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by
That could mean everything
I am a street watching the people walk
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk
Then I hear everything

Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
'Til the early hours
Then I am everything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
That could mean everything

Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
'Til the early hours
Then I am everything

Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers

// Swan Song //

This is my swan song
Whatever I do now, I do it well
This is my swan song
I fell in love with you I love you well
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my last chance
A chance to show the world that I am strong
This is my last dance
I'm walking off the floor where I belong
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

La

And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my swan song
I fell in love with you
I love you well
I love you well
I love you well
