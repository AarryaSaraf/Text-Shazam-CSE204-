// Point Of Collapse //

They're checking the traps
For one of the chaps
In the backroom
Jimmy's counting the stamps
Death in the living room
His favorite sport

A happy end
The point of collapse

There's no space in my car
All my papers are false
You're carrying a bag
A happy end
The point of collapse

In a free-climbing, two-timing, three-legged waltz

Can I leave a message?
But don't use my voice
Don't trust the man
Don't give him the choice
Of removing his jacket
When he says he's one of the boys

A happy end
The point of collapse

// Ahead //

Lips growing for service
Eyes steady for peeling
Bring on the special guest
A monkey caught stealing
Standard rewards in corners
Is full-board in new quarters
Kneeling for pleasure
Ensures a good time

I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember
Making the body search
Someone is taking you
Someone has taken me
TV doesn't understand
A word that matters
Scattering desires to
Smouldering fires
Someone has taken you
Someone is taking me

I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember
Making the body search

I remember
Making the body search
That is was nothing
But enough for ahead

I remember
Making the body search
That is was nothing
But enough for ahead

// Madman's Honey //

A grand mute proof at Nemrt Dag
That man's as mad as a hatter

How does it feel when it's revealed?
You've reached the living end

Master cut the stone out
My name is Lubert Das
Abandoned now as the grass grows out
Of the head and groin of the dome

How does it feel with one turn of the wheel?
You reach the living end

Master cut the stone out
My name is Lubert Das
A far-u ranch at Ufra Charin
Fish ponds and a madman's honey

How does it feel, is it hard to conceal?
When you reach the living end

// Feed Me //

What's the point
It's your table
I alter my altar
For every mouthful
You're unable
For every mouthful
I hunger

Feed me
Ooh, feed me

Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ooh, feed me
Ooh, feed me

Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by in inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ooh, feed me
Feed me
Ooh, feed me

How fast do you run?
How fast can you run?

// Ambitious //

Chain link route ways
Digital time base
New hours for these days
New files engaged
Strangeness detectors
Collage charmers
Magnetic behavior
Quarks and order

When it's cold, I feel cold
When it's hot, I feel ambitious
Fit for a princess
Hot on the heels of an angel
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot?
I feel ambitious

The ideal copy is the same
The ideal copy has your name
When you can't, it makes you can
When you aren't, it makes you am

When it's cold, I feel cold
When it's hot, I feel ambitious
Fit for a princess
Hot on the heels of an angel
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot?
I feel ambitious

When it's cold, I feel cold
When it's hot, I feel ambitious
Fit for a princess
Hot on the heels of an angel
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot?
I feel ambitious

The ideal copy is what you want
When you won't, it makes you will
The ideal copy makes you happy
The ideal copy

When it's cold, I feel cold
When it's hot, I feel ambitious
Fit for a princess
Hot on the heels of an angel
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot?
I feel ambitious

// Cheeking Tongues //

Oh, I what gets revealed
In the inland sea
Eels in lungs
A mystery
Begin to pull in and out
Then stomachs wail
For what went astray
For what went astray

Oh, that cheeking tongue
Oh, that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all history

Delirious vandals struggle with meters
A cheek tango with liters
Which fits and almost sick
Half track associations
Appear on parade
Appear on parade

Oh, that cheeking tongue
Oh, that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all history

Unrefined, the final scam
It doesn't rhyme, it didn't matter
A soundtrack for your silence
Insincere

Oh, that cheeking tongue
Oh, that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all history

// Still Shows //

Steel testing on
Long good mornings
We make our days
As our days make us

Cutting the rabbit
Pressing skin
Selecting gear
Tearing about
Tearing about

In extravagant promises
Mysterious terrors thrive
Judgement dies
Into scenic affects
Yellow, it still shows
It still shows through

Skinning the rabbit
Dressing the skin
Selecting an ear
Tearing about
Tearing about

Cutting the rabbit
Pressing skin
Selecting gear
Tearing about
Tearing about
...

// A Serious Of Snakes //

It looks serious
Is that a paper I see in your hand?
Then a pause for a German phrase
"Nie weider nie weider, nie weider nie weider"
Never again, none of your lip, y'tulip
Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued snake
I'd rather make furniture than go to midnight mass

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

He's a genius in research, I simply fell in love
I've got your ZIP code
Over there U.S.A., green turbaned angels
Annex the right bank
Baby, in a shambolic sideshow
They abandoned the baby
The baby trained, baby returns
Baby kills Mary and Joseph

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

Talk about laughing, I might have defeated cancer or so they say
Electrocuted, I was transformed into a foot soldier of the good general
Passionate for knights in the heart of ancient Persia
Fearless to go forth, fearless to adapt then blow to pieces

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

Please send your god my very best wishes
Does he still sing?
Does he still fish?
Does he still help you on your days off?
Don't stop that dripping
I prefer the old tortures
It's only when you stop that I feel it

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

When you lose the ship, it's like losing a part of you
I have a sense of my exposure, it's all on the neg
I try to use two instead of three, ah, but I have secrets
And there's a story in me, it starts

Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot...

// Drill //

Are you level? How's your trim?
Do you rotate, eddy, or spin?
Are you game? What's your trick?
Do you vibrate, bounce, or tick?
What's your cut? Are you correct?
Do you detour, bend, or stretch?

We're milling through the grinder, grinding through the mill
If this is not an exercise, could it be a drill?

How's it with you? What's your form?
Your outline, shape, or form
How's your price? What do you cost?
Your value, profit, or loss
How's your skull? Does it fit?
Is your mind free, empty, or split?

Drill drill drill
Dugga dugga dugga

// Advantage In Height //

A brief Bombay, Colossus encounter
A holy rolling, rhino blessing

Two men in white, an advantage in height
In appearance unique, in action delivers

The light fades, the sun never never sets
A: a double blow, B: an immortal being

Two men in white, an advantage in height
In appearance unique, in action delivers

Two men in white, an advantage in height
In appearance unique, in action delivers

A creator lover, a bee-driver
A therez wipe-out, a therez wipeout

Two men in white, an advantage in height
In appearance unique, in action delivers

Two men in white, an advantage in height
In appearance unique, in action delivers

// Up To The Sun //

I hire an idiot to flood
A canvas in a riot of red
I hire an idiot to flood
A canvas in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy heartache in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy jaundice in a riot of red

In the colour of the red bull
I envelop you
Whilst more red planes they still fly east
I envelop you

Ooo, up to the sun shall go
Thy heartache in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy jaundice in a riot of red
May this person go unscathed
And be free of yellow colour
May this person go unscathed
And be free of yellow colour

In the colour of the red bull
I envelop you
Whilst more red planes still fly east
I envelop you

After a dawn of anxious waiting
To swim in the streets is scintillating

// Ambulance Chasers (Live) //

Ever creeping and climbing
The dogs keep griming
Fucking and sliming
No sense of timing
Anytime's alright
For what they've got in mind

Watch the front
Watch your behind
When they come

Arse sniffing
Wanting to kiss and make up
So terribly cut up
Oh, so terribly cut up
Oh, so terribly cut up
...
