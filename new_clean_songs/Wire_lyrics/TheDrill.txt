// In Every City? //

Starting with an ABC
Wanting to drillfully
Editing skillfully
Arguing forcefully

Want to drill you
Want to drill you

Any small thing that we find
Lengthened moments in the sea
Driving me home
Any places far or near

Want to drill you
Want to drill you

It begins at one and is followed by two
An X marks the spot where I met U

I want to drill you
I want to drill you
In the heart of the earth under the ground
In every city and every town
I want to drill you
I want to drill you
I want to drill you

Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)

If you're saved or if you're lost
If you are free, what is the cost?
I want to drill you

Driving me home
Driving me home
Any places far or near
Any places far or near

Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you
Want to drill you

If you're scarred, if you're a fool
If you are hot, if you are cool
It's up to you, it's up to me
There's only one thing that it can be
One

Want to drill you
Want to drill you

// What's Your Desire? //

Dugga-dugga-dugga

What's your gift?
What's your curse?
Is it fatal charm or worse?

What's your promise?
What's your pledge?
Do you dive in or cling to the edge?

What's your plan?
Do you watch your back?
Do you hold fire, retreat, or attack?

What's your step?
What's your design?
Are you out of the way in time?

Are you safe?
Are you real?
Do you beg, connive, or steal?

Are you curved?
Are you straight?
Do you love, adore, or hate?

// Arriving/Staying/Going? //

Are you off? Are you on?
Arriving, staying, gone
Do you flow? What's your line?
Do you separate, mix, or combine?
What's your output? How's your growth?
Was your statement sworn under oath?

Are you hollow? Do you ring?
Keep, save, sent, or pray?
What's your cost? Where will it end?
Do you parry, fate, or pretend?
Are you impressed? Are you in awe?
Is your goose cooked or raw?

We're milling through the grinder, we're grinding through the mill

Are you loyal? Are you proud?
Is your silence painful or loud?
Where's your grip? Do you slide?
Recover, charge, and hide
What's your quote? Do you vote?
Do you turn, or does your coat?
Are you spare? Have you a part?
Is there a finish, a middle, or start?

// (A Berlin) Drill //

Are you level? How's your trim?
Do you rotate, eddy, or spin?
Are you game? What's your trick?
Do you vibrate, bounce, or tick?
What's your cut? Are you correct?
Do you detour, bend, or stretch?

We're milling through the grinder, ? grinding through the mill
If this is not an exercise, could it be a drill?

How's it with you? What's your form?
Your outline, shape, or form
How's your price? What do you cost?
Your value, profit, or loss
How's your skull? Does it fit?
Is your mind free, empty, or split?

We're milling through the grinder, we're grinding through the mill
If this is not an exercise, could it be a drill?
