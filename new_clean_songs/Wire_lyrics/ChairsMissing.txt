// Practice Makes Perfect //

Practice makes perfect
Yes, I can prove it
Business or pleasure
The more that you do it

Please dress in your best things
This course was unplanned
'Cause you see up in my bedroom
I've got Sarah Bernhardt's hand

Practice makes perfect
I've done this before
Never for money
Always for love

Please dress in your best things
And don't make a fuss
'Cause you see up in my bedroom
Sarah's waiting for us

Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us...

// French Film Blurred //

I didn't understand your plea to live
Or the guy's wish to take or give
However as backing away, he fell and lay dead amongst the fireworks display

It's not quite the way to say goodbyes
It's not quite the way to behave
Secured you a concrete grave beneath a motorway

Gold scissors cut the ribbon and set them loose
On the opening day the vibrations will shake your bones
But that's just the disadvantage of not speaking a second language

A second language
A second language

A second language
A second language (The problems of bad reception resulting in blurred perception)

A second language
A second language

A second language
A second language

A second language
A second language

// Another The Letter //

Passed to hand, behind the curtain
The letter brings change, now things are uncertain
Hand to hand, the letter moves on
Like a series of shocks, like a series of shocks
Like a series of shocks, like a series of shocks
Like a series of shocks, but the contents are known

Oh, faint heart, when the letter arrives
You suddenly find things getting life-size
Life-size, life-size
Life-size, life-size

Once the air rang with things unsaid
Now cruel outlines are easily read
Behind the curtain, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
In the yellow bulb light, in the yellow bulb light
The letter reads, "I took my own life"

// Men 2nd //

Sailing under a false flag
We're crossing the IDL
Becalmed where no creature lives

Lost, forsaken, cursed

Holed below the water line
A shift in the plimsoll line
Pumps in the engine room

Women and children first

Hysterical, no humour
Sabotage, a rumour
Captain-less and captionless

Injury, hunger, thirst
Reptile, prehensile, servile, editorial, gentile, fatal

// Marooned //

An unwilling sailor adrift from Arctic waters
As the water gets warmer, my iceberg gets smaller

As he pours more petrol on, he feels no fear
As the flames get nearer, his thoughts get clearer

A blue-white polar bear arrives at the end
Diverting his attention, his feelings froze over

I'm only a runaway AWOL at the logical start
Not present in the present, overboard with limited future

And I'm standing alone, still getting a thrill
While the ship is afloat, he's losing his boat

// Sand In My Joints //

I've got sand in my joints
I'm counting the grains
And they're so sharp
I'm feeling the pain

I'm like King Canute's daughter
A lamb to the slaughter
My feet in the water
It's not what they think

It's not what it seems

I've got sand in my joints
I'm counting the grains
And they're so sharp
I'm feeling the pain
Pain, pain

Feeling the pain, the pain
Feeling the pain, the pain
Feeling the pain, the pain
Feeling the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain

// Being Sucked In Again //

A dorsal fin breaks the water
Salted meat, a sullen relapse
Inference drawn from every word

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked

Feeling numbed from anaesthetised flesh
Avoid disgrace, ideas still fresh
The gaping mouth, a fishwife's dream

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked

Bound and gagged, your labour's saved
The cost minute, the rules are waived
No hand, no step, your labour's in vain

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked

// Heartbeat //

I feel icy
I feel cold
I feel old
Is there something there behind me?
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime

I feel empty
I feel dark
I remark
I am mesmerised
By my own beat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
In its own beat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat

// Mercy //

Crooks lay in a weighted state
Waiting for the dead assassin
While the rust pure powder puffs
A shimmering opaque red
Papers spread, no one driving
We hurled direct ahead
The windows dark-green tinted
The hearse a taxi instead

Snowstorms forecast imminently in areas
Dogger, Viking
Moray, Firth, and Orkney
Keeping cover in denuded scrub
The school destroyed raised the club
Panic spreading with threat of fire
Crowding beneath a layer of foam
Refugees intertwined, alone

Within the institution walls
In pastel blue, clinical white
Slashed red lipsticked walls
Mercy nurse tonight

Seems like dark grey stockings
In the waking torchlight
With a 4 AM stubble
A midnight transvestite

Always fast and bubbly

// Outdoor Miner //

No blind spots in the leopard's eyes
Can only help to jeopardise
The lives of lambs, the shepherd cries

An outdoor life for a silverfish
Eternal dust less ticklish
Than the clean room, a houseguest's wish

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth

Face worker, a serpentine miner
A roof falls, an underliner
Of leaf structure, the egg timer

He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide?
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (He lies on his side)
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth (Is he trying to hide?)
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (He lies on his side)
In fact it's the earth which he's known since birth (Is he trying to hide?)
He lies on his side, is he trying to hide? (He lies on his side)
In fact it's the earth

// I Am The Fly //

Crawling
Over your window, you think I'm confused
I'm waiting for the divergent wasp
To complete my current ruse

You use a plate-glass screen
To protect my chosen target
But there's an air-pellet hole
I can crawl through to you

I am the fly in the ointment
I can spread more disease than the fleas
Which nibble away at your window display

Yes, I am the fly in the ointment
I shake you down to say please
As you accept the next dose of disease

I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment

I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
Yes, I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment
Yes, I am the fly, I am the fly
I am the fly, I am the fly
Fly in the, fly in the ointment

I am the fly

// I Feel Mysterious Today //

Always cause for concern (always)
When you're feeling quite (bright) quite
And your filament burns

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way

Is it ever appealing
To stand on a ceiling (watch out)
Observe the tension grow (grow, grow, grow)

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way

Going walking abroad (walking)
Minus hat before dawn
Bats in profusion there

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming my way

Did you ever conceive
That you too can leave
Exactly when you like

// From The Nursery //

So truly jolly, an Xmas dolly
I talk on request, I'm never depressed
I'll wink a good time till someone pokes me
One big blue eye out

So simply heady, a birthday teddy
Punches make me bleat, this bare soul is sweet
Keeping you warm at night till someone rubs me
Hey, a fun-filled toy

Free on a tightrope lives the animal soap
Safe, used, been tested, body molester
Amphibious charm, scum in several baths
Has blurred my features

Would you like to say
What that silence was meant to intend?
Would you like to see
What violence these eyes can send
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery

To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart
From the nursery
To your heart...

// Used To //

Does the pain remain when the head is turned
And the body walks away? You used to know
Does nausea ensue when you chance upon a memory
Of someone you used to know?
Does warmth increase when the pulse is strong
But the response is weak? You used to know

I just lay down guidelines in front of me
It's similar to the things you do to me

Does the pain remain when the head is turned
And the body walks away? You used to know
Does nausea ensue when you chance upon a memory
Of someone you used to know?
Does warmth increase when the pulse is strong
But the response is weak? You used to know

I'll give you an example typically
It's less complicated than it simply should be

// Too Late //

Oh, you should miss her, she says she's my sister
She's never hard to find
She's tender-trusting, she's everlasting
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?

Mirror, mirror, icy sister
Love is never blind
She's slowly turning, mouth gently burning
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?

She pisses icy water on poetic mornings
Got to be cruel to be kind
Is this real life, is it for life?
Can I change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too late

Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Is it too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too, too, too late

// Go Ahead //

Forensic evidence proves
By the profile of the grooves
A serious intent
For the incident
Length and context betwixt
Start events, eventual exit

Advertising communicates
Radio players hesitate
Critical acclaim cannot explain
The extent of the sales
Or why this one pales
In comparison
In comparison with what?
You may well ask
Go ahead

The new single after entering the chart at 75 and in receipt of increased marketing activity plus the few daytime plays on national radio has responded with increasing sales in the chart return shops reflected by next week's chart entry into the top 40 at 27 thus there has been increased daytime play which is coupled with the fact that the promotional video has been well received by all local TV producers guarantees us greater media coverage not to mention what we are doing with the publications. Are there any questions?

You may well ask
Go ahead

Gentlemen the sales force is to be congratulated on its efforts. Is there any other business? No?

You may well ask
Go ahead

// Former Airline //

When you reach the point
Is it different enough?
Tell me what it's like when you reach the point

When you draw the line
Is it straight enough?
Tell me what it's like when you draw the line

When you go too far
Is it near enough?
Tell me what it's like when you go too far

When you've seen too much
Is it almost the same?
Tell me what it's like when you've seen too much

When you know it all
Is it really there?
Tell me what it's like when you know it all

When you've had enough
Is it just the start?
Tell me what it's like when you've had enough

// A Question Of Degree //

Once a question of degree
Now circumstances corner me
Demanding my attention
Leaving little choice
Posing several questions
Distilling in one voice
Confusion not in words

I didn't want a problem
I didn't simply fall out
I was thrown at great speed
From a passing car
I didn't touch the ground
Till I landed at your door
Oh, don't touch my luggage

I can easily manage
To struggle inside

I hide my shaking
Thus protect my pride
I can surely manage
To tremble inside
Gathering myself
And spreading it around
Rivers are submerging
Flowing underground

I can surely manage
To struggle inside
Can I really manage
To survive outside?
Can I really manage
To survive outside?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
