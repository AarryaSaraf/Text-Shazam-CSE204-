// He Knows //

In the Baron's Nippon charger
The co-pilot a façade
In attendance tucked inside
Riding shot-gun talking hard was Bard

Though his kingdom was subsiding
Beyond the distant blue horizon
Elbow dancing in a fashion
Dressed in stolen threads of passion

Stardom's kingdom in scripted lies
The green room tango, hip no ties
Walk this way, get a wise guy prize
Fox-trot partners, cannibalise

Not belonging even caring
You embrace the ever-scaring
Eyes of he who views unblinking
Who knows what you are thinking
Ignoring oceans crossing borders
Fulfilling arms providing orders
Awaiting sentence and what the word is
For you to know who their lord is

Stardom's kingdom in scripted lies
The green room tango, hip no ties
Walk this way, get a wise guy prize
Fox-trot partners, cannibalise

We so greedy, with so much need
Of your attention and all your love
We're hypnotised with
Hypnotised with
Hypnotised with
Hypnotised with all your love
With all your love
We're hypnotised with all your love
We're hypnotised

We're hypnotised
We're hypnotised
With all your love
We're hypnotised
With all your love

// Midnight Bahnhof Cafe //

Objects which merge in the dark
Voices with a peculiar ring
Silhouettes with electric random
While skin diseases itch for tomorrow

A second visit brings confidence
& a cigarette adds security
Midnight railway café
Midnight Bahnhof café

A deterioration in the weather
Casting facets, I have the photograph
A full program missing person's bureau
All of the night there's empty biros
Batten the hatches, tie down the cargo
Feeling the edge of my tongue
That's Europe at night time

Midnight railway café
Midnight Bahnhof café

Whistle softly for school admission
(Midnight Bahnhof café)
Speak slowly, re-evaluate my fears
(Midnight Bahnhof café)
Walking the same corridors as before
(Midnight Bahnhof café)
The passageway ahead is very clear
(Midnight Bahnhof café)
The carpet luscious, the plot has thickened

Midnight railway café
Midnight railway café
Midnight Bahnhof café
Midnight Bahnhof café
