// Follow //

Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack

Hold out I know you feel it getting cold out
Without the blanket for your soul and
Before you know it you'll be frozen
And you have to see this through
There's no one here but you

I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory

Don't go to sleep and cry because
Tomorrow if you let it, it will swallow
You up and none of this will matter
Anymore 

I feel the rain coming down
It reminds me of who I used to be
But now that's nothing more
Than a memory...

Follow your heart and see where it might take you
Don't let the world outside there break you
They know not who you are inside
They've never felt your hell
Don't ever let them crack your shell

// What Can I Say //

Look to the clock on the wall
Hands hardly moving at all
I can't stand the state that I'm in
Sometimes it feels like the walls closing in

Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say

Try to burn my troubles away
Drown my sorrow the same way
Seems no matter how hard I try
Feels like there's something just missing inside

Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say
Oh, Lord, what can I say

How many rules can I break
How many lies can I make
How many roads must I turn
To find me a place where the bridge hasn't burned

Oh, Lord, what can I say
I'm so sad since you went away
Time, time, ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Lord, what can I say
Oh, Lord, what can I say

// Closer To You //

It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
But I just wanna be closer to you

And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
I just wanna be closer to you

Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day my life is through
But I just wanna be closer to you

Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
And we all needed something real we all need proof
But I just wanna be closer to you
I only wanna be closer to you

// Throw It All Away //

When you're near me I have no fear
When I'm untrue you see right through me
You know me as deep as the sea goes
Calm my head whenever a storm blows

When the stars, and the moon,
and the sky fall through

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away

So in my restless hour I'm holding
Words you say that lay my soul to sleep
I dream of buildings that burn
The sky turns black, I toss and turn

When the stars, and the moon,
and the sky fall through

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away

This love branches out like an oak tree
Reach for the sky and roots to the sea
So when you're shaken down and broken
Find your peace of mind in knowing

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away

// Happy //

I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
I've gotten so much braver, can you tell

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee

And I line my secrets up all one by one
I put 'em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee

I believe

Where have you been all these years
How could you just disappear
And when did you stop missing me

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee

// Someday Never Comes //

Dear Love, I'll miss you much
I'll miss your smile and I'll miss your touch
But I found a place where I can erase my past 
Maybe someday when you're old and gray
When your hair falls out and your tattoos fade
You might see me standing, hand in hand

I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes

You built your rooms, you built your walls
You kept me outside of it all
I got tired of you, what's a girl to do
Maybe someday if we stay this way
And you see my face in a different place
You'll remember when, you're gonna thank me then

I have to go away
I've got no reason to stay here
You said someday you'll change
But even a fool will tell you
Someday never comes

// Fall Apart Again //

Long is the day, take it away
Hold it up and you don't let it fall
Cause devil's play was yesterday
And I don't care about that at all

I just smile, once in a while
Cause I don't want the lines on my face
And I sit right here, holding the years
And I count all the stars in space

You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand

Self-respect goes unexpressed
I don't dream cause I cannot sleep
And I think the world of myself
But the world doesn't think much of me

As long as the day is full of time
There will always be room for your hand in mind

You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand
I don't wanna hear you say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see, that means nothing to me

No one's home, I'm alone with my music and my defeat
And I still say that yesterday is best when left to sleep

You fall apart again, and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else, cause they won't understand
I don't wanna hear you say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see, that means nothing to me

// In My Own Eyes //

Hold me down, lift me up
There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me
I hear my name, turn around
There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see
Around me, hide me

Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes

Something's wrong, awake all night
'Cause I can feel the dark side closing in on me
Do you see me as I see myself
I promise there's a downside, something you can't see
About me, hide me

Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes

Lost in translation, free to fall
One situation and lose it all

Hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really wanna be seen...
I don't really wanna be seen
In my own eyes

// Gone //

Life is too short to waste all your time
Running too quickly to the finish line
Time is a trap, it's ready and set
And the longer you live, the closer you get to being

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...

There's no guarantee or promise of wealth
And you're only allowed so much time on the shelf
Time isn't money, it's only a lie
Because everything lost can be found but your time when you're

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...

So live in doubt, live in fear
And you might live forever
Or live it up, and watch your back,
And you might live for better

Gone, gone like the evening
Sun, sun when it sets
Gone, gone like the darkness
At dawn, and then we forget
Oooooooooh...

// Tragedy //

Sorry, I'm only
Human, you know me
Grown up, oh no guess again

My days always
Dry up and blow away
Sometimes I could do that too
But make no mistake that

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end

Progress, changing
Growing then giving up
Somehow I'm never quite prepared
But I understand that

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end

So taking you with me would be like
Taking all your money to the grave
It does no good to anyone especially
The one you're trying to save
It's so hard not to say

When you need a friend
You could count on anyone
But you know I'll defend
The tragedy that we knew as the end

// Sixty Years On //

Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
'Cause the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
