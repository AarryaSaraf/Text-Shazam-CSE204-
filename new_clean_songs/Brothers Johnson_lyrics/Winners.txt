// The Real Thing //

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

I've longed to have this chance
With you, I feel romance
It's all for love and I want it bad

Seeing you is just a turn on
And loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feeling in my heart
That just won't let you go

I'll hold on, I'll keep on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

Seeing you is just a turn on
Loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feeling in my heart
That just won't let you go

I'll hold on, I'll keep on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

// Sunlight //

Sunlight you are my little sunlight
You shined into my life
I've been waitin' for someone like you
To reflect on me the way you do

Sunlight
You always seem to shine bright fantasy
Fantasize
You are the one of a kind in my life
Love shines in a way felt by one who says
To need love is one thing
I see the joy it brings
Little light
I've never seen a flash of light
Designed just for me
Were you meant?
Maybe sent by a God above me
If it's true keep shining through

Sunlight
You always seem to shine bright fantasy
Fantasize
You are the one of a kind in my life
Love shines in a way felt by one who says
To need love is one thing
I see the joy it brings

Sunlights
Up my life everyday and night
The sight of seeing you just makes my day
And through your eyes
There's a gleam of delight
Love shines in again and again and again
I find I've got peace of mind
You shined my way

// Caught Up //

The time is now
Get your gear ready to fly
Gatherin' around
No holdin' us down
We're leavin' the ground

Caught in the clouds
So spread the news
Cause the music's sweeter
There beautiful sound
Is to be found
It's all around

Caught in the clouds
It's gettin' late
What cha waitin' for?
Come on
Gatherin' around
No holdin' us down
We're leavin' the ground

Caught in the clouds
Caught up in the clouds of love
You and I in clouds of love
Said we're flying high
Gonna meet you in the sky

// In The Way //

The victim of circumstance
In thinking he's found his only chance
She pulls him further 'way
A future like ours to see
Whatever will be will surely be
So the people say

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

You used to walk well with two
But the first got the best of you
The second apologies
You sit by the telephone
Taking calls from the ones you've known
Something we all can see

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up

Something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

Something in the way she feels
Something
Something in the way she feels
Something
Said you got to pick up what's real
Something that you got to feel
Something
Something in the way she feels

// I Want You //

In my life, I've learned to take my falls
Pick 'em up, turn 'em around and look at 'em all
It seems all my time's spent on these worthless things
I can't find the time to enjoy the good life brings

And then you walk right in my life so beautifully
And there is no one else I'd rather see

I want you, I want you in my heart
I want you, I needed you from the start
I want you, I need you every day
I want you, I'll take you any way

All the things in life may be around
They cost a pretty penny, so I found
There ain't nothing in this world as good as you
So now I choose, I want to be with you

So let me love you with all my heart and all my soul
Just being near you, I have no control
So let me touch you, let me love you always
'Cause you're the reason why I just got to say
I love you and I need you now

All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
