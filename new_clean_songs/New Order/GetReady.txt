Album: GetReady

// Crystal //

We're like crystal, we break easy

I'm a poor man, if you leave me

I'm applauded, then forgotten

It was summer, now it's autumn


I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway

I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed

Here comes love, it's like honey

You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore, 

(whenever you're here with me), 

You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core


We're like crystal, it's not easy

With your love, you could feed me

Every man, and every woman

Needs someone, So keep it coming 

Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming

Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming

Keep it coming


I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway

I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed

Here comes love, it's like honey

You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore,

(whenever you're here with me), 

You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core


Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming

Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming

Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming

// 60 Miles An Hour //

I don't know if I told you, but I'm seeking sanctuary

You'll never guess the things that I do

I'll have the devil round for tea

Don't you know that I'm here beside you

Can't you see that I can't relax

When I saw you in my rearview

You could've stopped me in my tracks


I'll be there for you when you want me to

I'll stand by your side like I always do

In the dead of night it'll be alright

'Cos I'll be there for you when you want me to


You can take me to an island, ride across the stormy sea

We can worship pagan idols, there together you and me

Why don't you run over here and rescue me?

You can drive down in your car

Why don't we both take a ride and turn that key

We'll drive at 60 miles an hour


I'll be there for you when you want me to

I'll stand by your side like I always do

In the dead of night it'll be alright

'Cos I'll be there for you when you want me to


I'll be there for you when you want me to

I'll stand by your side like I always do

In the dead of night it'll be alright

'Cos I'll be there for you when you want me to


I'll be there for you when you want me to

I'll stand by your side like I always do

In the dead of night it'll be alright

'Cos I'll be there for you when you want me to


I'll be there for you when you want me to

I'll stand by your side like I always do

In the dead of night it'll be alright

'Cos I'll be there for you when you want me to

// Turn My Way //

Take my hand 

And don't let go

Trust this man

And let it flow


Don't take me down

Cause I'm not done

Don't steal my crown

Before it's won

The wide expanse

The wheel of chance

Will turn my way

The sky will not be gray


I don't wanna be like other people are

Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car

Don't wanna have to work like other people do

I want it to be free, I want it to be true


Take my hand

And don't let go

Trust this man

And let it flow


I drank in every bar in town

I filled my cup when I was down

I saw the things I wanted to see

Became the man I wanted to be

But then somehow I lost my way

I've got to get back there today


I don't wanna be like other people are

Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car

Don't wanna have to work like other people do

I want it to be free, I want it to be true


I don't wanna be like other people are

Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car

Don't wanna have to work like other people do

I want it to be free, I want it to be true


I don't wanna be like other people are

Don't wanna own a key, don't wanna wash my car

Don't wanna have to work like other people do

I want it to be free, I want it to be true


I don't wanna be like other people are

Don't wanna own a key, Don't wanna wash my car

I lie awake at night, or wait until it's light

I want it to be free, I thought that I was right


Tought that I was right

Tought that I was right

Tought that I was right

Tought that I was right

Tought that I was right

Tought that I was right

// Vicious Streak //

What am I gonna do

I feel like I'm on fire

If you only knew

That you're the object of desire


I keep hanging on, keep hanging on

And I swear by God that you're the only one

I keep hanging on, keep hanging on

And I swear by God that it won't be long


My aim is true

My vision is clear

My thoughts are crude

Whenever you're near


I keep hanging on, keep hanging on

And I swear by God that you're the only one

I keep hanging on, keep hanging on

And I swear by God that it won't be long


I keep hanging on


You've got a vicious streak

For someone so young

You're like solar flair

In the rising sun


I keep hanging on

I keep hanging on

I keep hanging on

I keep hanging on

// Primitive Notion //

It doesn't take a lot to confuse me

I'm not aware of the passing of time

And I'd like to say to those who accuse me

Could you do it while you looked in my eye


If you hold on primitive notion

And if you think you'd like to try

You can drink this magic potion

And you can do it 'til the day that you the day that you die


I've done it before and I'll do it again

A judgement of life that I'll burn 'til the end

How can it be that we're so far apart 

I want it to be like it did at the start


I'm doing my best to confound? you

Your behaviour is so volatile

Not even a zoo would impound you

Don't look at me with your criticle smile


Well I've been driving in the wrong gear

It's been a long and lonely ride

It's been winter for a whole year

But you couldn't hurt me if you tried


I've done it before and I'll do it again

Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end

How can it be that we're so far apart 

I want it to be like it did at the start


I've done it before and I'll do it again

A judgement of life that I'll burn 'til the end

How can it be that we're so far apart 

I want it to be like it did at the start


I've got a message that I need to send

It's coming to you straight from a friend

I wanted to see what's inside my heart

I wanted to be like it was in the start

// Slow Jam //

As I look at the morning sky

Today the wind is blowing hard

See that bird is floating high

Pretty soon it will be tired

I spent a day all by myself

A rich man without his wealth

Sometimes I get it wrong

But I'm not the only one


The afternoon was very clear

The sun was beating down on me

I got thirsty for a beer

That I had to go to sea

The sea was very rough

It made me feel sick

But I like that kind of stuff

It beats arithmetic


I don't want the world to change

I like the way it is

Just give me one more wish

I can't get enough of this

When it gets to be alive

And not just still survive

To hit and not to miss

I can't get enough of this


The early evening mists

Look beautiful to me

Was sweeter than a kiss

I wish you all could see

I'm a long long way from home

But this photograph of you

Even though it's monochrome

Tells me what I should do

So I got up on my feet

I knew it would be alright

For my clothes were looking beat

In the middle of the night


I don't want the world to change

I like the way it is

Just give me one more wish

I can't get enough of this

When it gets to be alive

And not just still survive

To hit and not to miss

I can't get enough of this


I don't want the world to change

I like the way it is

Just give me one more wish

I can't get enough of this

When it gets to be alive

And not just still survive

To hit and not to miss

I can't get enough of this


I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

I can't get enough of this

// Rock The Shack //

I've been accused of everything

From Tombuctu to old Berlin

I need some armor for my flesh

I need to stop and take a rest


I've been wide-eyed but couldn't see

I stand accused of being me


I believe in politics

I believe in everything

I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline

When I hear a baby cry

When I see an old man die

That's just the way it is


Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack

Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack


Yeah that's the way it is


I took each day the way it came

I put my future out of frame

The signs were there for all to see

Like blue eyed mind to you and me

My head laid on my beating breast

I swear to you I pass the test

I walked one hundred thousand miles

And you're the judge who's been my trial

? my trial


I believe in politics

I believe in everything

I believe this world of ours is just a den of vice and sins

And even on the darkest night

We could reach for the light

And we could get it right


Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right

Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right


I believe in politics

I believe in everything

I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline

Ten thousand year ago

Crawling on the floor

Well get up Jack

It's time to rock the shack


Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack

Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack


It's time to get up

// Someone Like You //

This can't be real

My heart is burning

How does it feel

Well let's say I'm learning

It had to come

The ship has landed

It's time to run

The crew are stranded


We're having the time of our lives

We're lost in a cruel paradise


Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do

Return my heart, yeah, make it feel like it does at the start

Someone like you, Someone like you, yeah


You're everything to me

The sweetest symphony

All that I try to be

You are my harmony

I guess what I mean to say

Is you keep the walls at bay

The children on holiday

Here comes the crowd


We're having the time of our lives

We're lost in a cruel paradise


Someone like you can make me feel like I used to do

Return my heart, yeah, make it feel like it does at the start

Someone like you, yeah, Someone like you, yeah

// Close Range //

I wanna scream, I wanna shout

I wanna know what it's all about

I've seen it before but not like this

I saw your name, it was on the list


By 4 O'Clock (It's gonna change)

You were pretty high (It's gonna change)

Right on the floor (It's gonna change)

Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)

I remember you (It's gonna change)

When you were a kid (It's gonna change)

It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)

And things you did


You've got to pull yourself together man

You've got to get back on your feet again

How can I ever make you understand

You've got the world right in your hands


No cold heart could turn away

And not be moved by what I saw today

There on the floor, thirty years or more

He doesn't care, he just wants to score


By 4 O'Clock (It's gonna change)

You were pretty high (It's gonna change)

Right on the floor (It's gonna change)

Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)

I remember you (It's gonna change)

When you were a kid (It's gonna change)

It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)

And things you did


You've got to pull yourself together man

You've got to get back on your feet again

How can I ever make you understand

You've got the world right in your hands


You've got to pull yourself together man

You've got to get back on your feet again

How can I ever make you understand

You've got the world right in your hands


Yet it only seems just like yesterday

We used to run and hide

Remember in the park where we used to play

The grass looked ten foot high


You've got to pull yourself together man

You've got to get back on your feet again

How can I ever make you understand

You've got the world right in your hands


You've got to pull yourself together man

You've got to get back on your feet again

How can I ever make you understand

You've got the world right in your hands

// Run Wild //

Open hearts

Empty spaces

Dusty roads

To distant places

But all the time

When I'm alone

I think of you

And how you've grown


Far and wide

Sweet and simple

Jehovah knows

That I've been sinful


But if Jesus comes to take your hand

I won't let go, I won't let go


I'm not cruel

And you're not evil

And we're not like

All those stupid people

Who can't decide

Which book to read

Unless the paper

Sows deceit


You're the kind of person

That I've always wanted to be with

We'll you're really cool

And you always say the right things to me

But now I'll tell you something

From my heart beats for you deep inside

But never be a burden

And my love for you will never die, 

never die, never die, never die, never die


But if Jesus comes to take your hand

I won't let go, I won't let go


But if Jesus comes to take your hand

I won't let go, I won't let go


Good times around the corner

Good times around the corner

Good times around the corner

I swear it's getting warmer

Good times around the corner

Good times around the corner

Good times around the corner


I'm gonna live 'til I die

I'm gonna live to get high

// Behind Closed Doors //

There is a secret place 

Underneath a tree

Where if you go and haste

You will find a key

The key will open doors

And you will look inside

The things that you will see 

Will open up your eyes


At any given time

On every other street

The city comes to life

Though everyone's asleep

A man beats up his wife

He doesn't wanna keep

Behind closed doors

They're in retreat


I don't know what makes me stay

The city life just ain't the same

There's something wrong with kids today

I blame the parents anyway

There's no hope

No one to trust

I can't cope

It's obvious

Please don't take my drugs away

I'm gonna give them up someday


There is a place somewhere

That I could call a home

I'd live without a care

I'd never be alone

One day I will get there

I feel it in my bones

I check upon the scores

I listen to The Coors

Behind closed doors


Behind closed doors

Behind closed doors

Behind closed doors

They still want more

Behind closed doors
