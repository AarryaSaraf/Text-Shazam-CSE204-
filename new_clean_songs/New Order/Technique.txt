Album: Technique

// Fine Time //

You're much too young

To be a part of me

Too young

To get a hold on me


You're much too young

You're much too young

You're much too young

To mess around with me


Hey

You know I've met a lot of cool chicks 

But I've never met a girl with all her own teeth

That's why I love you babe

That's why we could be 

But you're too young

Too young


The past doesn't matter [12x]


Hey

Sophisticated lady

You know I've met a lot of cool chicks

But you've got style

You've got class

But most of all

You've got love technique.

// All The Way //

It doesn't take a genius

To tell me what I am

Or lecture me with poetry

And tell me that I can

I don't remember

What happened yesterday

But I don't give a damn about

What all those people say


It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone

It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone


It don't take no Houdini

To tell me what I am

Parasites and literasites

They'd burn me if they can

But I don't give a damn about

What those people say

They pick you up and kick you out

They hurt you every day


It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone

It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone


It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone

It takes years to find the nerve

To be apart from what you've done

To find the truth inside yourself

And not depend on anyone

// Love Less //

There was a time I call before

When all I knew was what I saw

The keeper of a major key

I lived in a town called Liberty


I worked hard

To give you all the things that you need

And almost anything that you see

I spent a lifetime working on you

And you won't even talk to me


Can't you see

Why don't you look at me

It's not your right to be

So much my enemy


I knew that I could never give

You knew that you could not forgive

No price or pride would fall before

A ten foot wall without a door


But you know

I watch every step that you make

To find some other fool you can take

And I don't know why I even try

Because it all comes down to this


Can't you see

Why don't you look at me

It's not your right to be

So much my enemy


Can't you see

Why don't you look at me

It's not your right to be

So much my enemy


I worked hard

To give you all the things that you need

And almost anything that you see

I spent a lifetime working on you

And you won't even talk to me

// Round & Round //

I just can't help thinking

What you've done to me

You built a wall of love and tore it right down

In front of me

And you think you know what's going on

You keep telling me that I am wrong

I don't care about what you do

'Cause if you mess with me I'll get rid of you


The picture you see is no portrait of me

It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know

And it's driving me wild

It makes me act like a child


You think I am crazy, but what can I do

You waste your time, like my money

It ain't so funny, but it's true

(Don't waste my money, baby)

Now you can't tell me what's going on

And that I am weak while you are strong

What is it you need, that makes your heart bleed

Do you really know? 'Cause it doesn't show


The picture you see is no portrait of me

It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know

And it's driving me wild

It makes me act like a child


The picture you see is no portrait of me

It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know

And it's driving me wild

It makes me act like a child

// Guilty Partner //

Listen to me

I know what I'm saying

But lord it don't come easy

To admit that I was wrong

It took me far too long

I counted on you

To give me a reason

Why the Sun don't shine in the season

Grey sky surrounded me


I'm not some kind of foolish lover

I couldn't take this from no other

You're not being cool with me

'Cause I always know you'll come back to me

Yes, you'll come back to me


'Cause I always know

What it takes to make you my lover


You once said to me

That I was a cruel man

And you know

That I almost believed you

I was blind, and I couldn't see

You took my sight from me


And all of these words

And all this emotion

Can't explain my hopeless devotion

Or change what had to be


I'm not some kind of foolish lover

I couldn't take this from no other

You're not being cool with me

'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me

Yes, you'll come back to me

Yes, you'll come back to me


I'm not some kind of foolish lover

I couldn't take this from no other

You're not being cool with me

'Cause I always know that you'll come back to me

Yes, you'll come back to me


I'm not some kind of foolish lover

I couldn't take this from another

It's no good being cool with me

'Cause I always know

What it takes to make you my lover

// Run //

Answer me

Why won't you answer me

I can't recall the day that I last heard from you

Well you don't get a town like this for nothing

So here's what you've got to do

You work your way to the top of the world

Then you break your life in two


Well what's the use in complaining

When you've got what you don't need

Anyone would think you were hardened too

What do you want me to believe


What the hell is happening

I can't think of everything

I don't know what day it is

Or who I'm talking to


But I know that I'm ok

'Cause you're here with me today

I haven't got a single problem

Now that I'm with you


So what's the use in complaining

When you've got everything you need

Anyone would think you were hardened too

What do you want me to believe

// Mr Disco //

How can I ever forget you

You don't know just what I've been through

The holiday we spent together

Lives with me now and forever


I tried but I can't find you

Tell me now what do I do

I tried but I can't find you

Tell me now what do I do


I can't find my piece of mind

Because I need you with me all of the time

I used to think about you night and day

I used to feel what language cannot say

Oh I can't find you

No I can't find my piece of mind without you


Maybe you'd write me a letter

And tell me why I never met you

Our rendezvous just ended in sorrow

Without you there's no tomorrow


I tried but I can't find you

Tell me now what do I do

I tried but I can't find you

Tell me now what do I do


I can't find my piece of mind

Because I need you with me all of the time

I used to think about you night and day

I didn't care what other people would say

Oh I can't find you

No I can't find my piece of mind without you


I can't find my piece of mind

Because I need you with me all of the time

I used to think about you night and day

I used to feel what language cannot say

Oh I can't find you

No I can't find my piece of mind without you


Ibiza, Majorca, and Benidorm too

I've searched all these places but never found you

// Vanishing Point //

Grow up children, don't you suffer

At the hands of one another

If you like a sleeping demon

Listen can you hear him weeping

Tears of joy and tears of sorrow

He buys love to sell tomorrow


My life ain't no holiday

I've been through the point of no return

I've seen what a man can do

I've seen all the hate of a woman too


Feel your heartbeat lose the rhythm

He can't touch the world we live in

Life is short but love is strong

There lies a hope that I have found

And if you try you'll find it too

Remember why I'm telling you


My life ain't no holiday

I've been through the point of no return

I've seen what a man can do

I've seen all the hate of a woman too


And they gave him away

Like in 'Whistle Down The Wind'

By the look on his face

He never gave in

// Dream Attack //

Nothing in this world

Can touch the music that I heard

When I woke up this morning

It put the Sun into my life

It cut my heartbeat with a knife

It was like no other morning


I don't belong to noone

But I want to be with you

I can't be owned by noone

What am I supposed to do


I can't see the sense in your leaving

All I need is your love to believe in


Don't look into the sun

It's not for me or anyone

To steal the light out of the sky

Is it really such a sin

'Cause if it is then I'll give in

I can't live without your love


I don't belong to noone

But I want to be with you

I can't be owned by noone

What am I supposed to do


I can't see the sense in your leaving

All I need is your love to believe in

And for you I would do what I can

But I can't change the way that I am
