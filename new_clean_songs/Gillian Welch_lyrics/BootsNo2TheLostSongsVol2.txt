// Wouldn't Be So Bad //

Take me back to Ramona Street
And fill my glass again with a bittersweet
'Cause I don't wanna see the life I had
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

The same mistake that I made before
But I'll be wakin' up on a killing floor
While the bells are ringin' so low and sad
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

The same mistake that I made before
But I'll be wakin' up on a killing floor
I remember now how I made you mad
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad
Wouldn't be so bad

// Didn't I //

Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?
Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?
Didn't I hear somebody talking?
Down in the alley, saw you were walking
Now, didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?

Didn't I spend all my money? Didn't I?
Didn't I spend all my money? Didn't I?
Didn't I spend all my money?
Buy a tailor-made suit for your honey
Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?

Now, didn't I save all my kisses? Didn't I?
Didn't I save all my kisses? Didn't I?
Didn't I save all my kisses?
Make your bed, wash your dirty dishes
Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?

Now, didn't I try makin' you happy? Didn't I?
Didn't I try and make you happy? Didn't I?
Didn't I try and make you happy?
Wave goodbye to my mom and pappy
Now, didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?

Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?
Didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?
Didn't I hear somebody talking?
Down in the alley, saw you were walking
Now, didn't I hear somebody talking? Didn't I?

Didn't I?
Didn't I?

// Good Baby //

Good baby, good baby, why do you cry?
Are you cold and tired or hungry and sad?
Good baby, good baby, tears upon your breast
Hush now, your mama is trying to rest

Good baby, good baby, don't be afraid
Daddy knows all the places where the lions have laid
Deep as a mountain, down in the pine
Good baby, good baby, always true and kind

Who will rock the cradle? Who will sing a song?
All the time she's walkin' with red shoes on
I'll rock the cradle, I'll sing a song
Good baby, good baby, when she's dead and gone

Good baby, good baby smiling at the mouth
Days will be warmer as we fly south
Down to the river, dark as a plow
Good baby, good baby, you're my baby now

Good baby, good baby, you're my baby now

// Hundred Miles //

Got a dusty neck and a bent back low
Feel the heat rise up off the red dog road
And up ahead's just more of the road not showin'
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

It's a long way up and a long way back
Ain't no shortcut and no sidetrack
And it ain't one sign of a shade tree growing
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

That's a hundred miles to get back to you
Been a hundred years, maybe two

I see the road stretch out for the old home place
I see a glad tear standing on grandma's face
Gonna get some love and a big hello in
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

Got a dusty neck and a bent back low
Feel the heat rise up off the red dog road
And up ahead's just more of the road not showing
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

// Rambling Blade //

I am the rake and the rambling blade
Bound to dance in the hangman's shade
Wear my scars, white as lace
Save me a prayer and a resting place

Oh, I am the rake and the rambling blade
You'll never know the miles I made
All my time spent on the run
But I have no debts and I promise none

I've never been a workin' man
I never took money from a needy hand
I won't take nothin' for my journey now
Though I see a sign a-hangin' 'bout
Oh, I see the sign a-hangin' 'bout

I am the rake and the rambling blade
Bound to dance in the hangman's shade
Wear my scars, white as lace
Save me a prayer and a resting place
For I am the rake and the rambling blade

// I Only Cry When You Go //

Here you are, come to tell me you're leaving
Because I'm cold and I don't understand
But you're wrong if you think I'm unfeeling
And I'm tough like a man

'Cause when you go, then my tears'll start falling
You don't see, so, honey, how could you know?
Though you call me a hard-hearted woman
Well, it just isn't so
But I only cry when you go

When I tried not to show any weakness
I thought it best, now I guess I was wrong
'Cause you think that I won't need you to lean on
And you think that I'm strong

But when you go, then my tears'll start falling
You don't see, so, honey, how could you know?
And though you call me a hard-hearted woman
Well, it just isn't so
But I only cry when you go

Though you call me a hard-hearted woman
It just isn't so, oh
But I only cry when you go

// Lonesome Just Like You //

Go on and leave me anytime you please
You can leave me weeping in the willow trees
But little darling, you know it's true
I'll be lonesome just like you

Go on and find you another love
I'm gonna get me a turtle dove
And when they both have fallen through
I'll be lonesome just like you

In the whole world over, in the whole world 'round
There's no two people so closely bound
But when the darkness is sad and blue
I'll be lonesome just like you

Go on and leave me anytime you please
You can leave me weeping to the willow trees
Until you come back, until you're true
I'll be lonesome just like you
I'll be lonesome just like you

// You Only Have Your Soul //

Oh my darling, pal of mine
Be careful what you sign
Be careful what you sign on the line
Give them silver and your gold
If you only have your soul
You only have your soul for all time

Please don't play the devil's game
To trick him out of fame
To trick him out of fame if you lose
'Cause he's smarter than you
Unblinking and untrue
Unblinking and untrue all his days

Oh my darling, pal of mine
Be careful what you sign
Be careful what you sign on the line
Give them silver and your gold
If you only have your soul
You only have your soul for all time

// Picasso //

There's a man at my doorway, brown as a railroad bum
There's a man at my doorway, brown as a railroad bum
Says his name is Picasso, I said, "Where did you come from?"

He painted a picture, made me green and blue
He painted a picture, made me green and blue
But the more I looked at it, the more I wanted to

I said, "Go away, Picasso, go on and let me be"
Go away, Picasso, go on and let me be
Since I seen your picture, everything looks wrong to me

All the pretty ponies are riding in the sun
All the pretty ponies are riding in the sun
I'm gonna go get a hotel, try to get my laundry done

// Beautiful Boy //

Oh, beautiful boy
What did I do to win your love?
I didn't mean to make you cry
What'll I do when morning comes?

You, you tremble and shake
Like an autumn leaf expecting to fall
Almost think you saw my mind
But you don't know me at all

'Cause I'm afraid of everything
Everything that romance brings
Freely givin' gifts that you can't repay
Sad goodbyes and darkened hearts
Telephones, and most of all
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday

You, you ain't to blame
Crazy love's got a mind of its own
You can't fight it once it stops
You can't help it if it don't

So I'm afraid of everything
Everything that romance brings
Freely givin' gifts that you can't repay
Sad goodbyes and darkened hearts
Telephones, and most of all
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday

// Happy Mother's Day //

Oh, it's happy Mother's Day
From your daughter far away
Loving wishes, hugs and kisses
Happy happy Mother's Day

I am thinking of you now
And I'll try to tell you how
Much I love you and I miss you
On this happy Mother's Day

Oh mom, I hope you know
That I always love you so
Not just the one day when we all say
Happy happy Mother's Day

Oh, it's happy Mother's Day
From your daughter far away
Hugs and kisses, loving wishes
Happy happy Mother's Day
Oh, it's happy Mother's Day

// Papa Writes To Johnny //

Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
It's been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the road

Blues on the table
There's blues every week
Pourin' out of the coffee pot
With the first cup of the day
Oh, the first cup of the day

Now where are my friends
When I'm takin' the heat?
Only help I got today
Was from a stranger on the street
Oh, the stranger on the street

And why would you laugh
If you wanted to cry?
Why would you say things
If you knew it was a lie?
Oh, you knew it was a lie

Dark was the night
The cold was on the ground
I couldn't sleep
So I got up and walked around
Oh, got up and walked around

And I walked into Dallas
Crying all the way
Running over in my mind
Everything I meant to say
Oh, everything I meant to say

Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
It's been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the road

// Fair September //

It was on a fair September night
That my lover came to me
I said, "Darling girl, you're strange to me now
Not like you used to be"
I remember you as a beautiful rose
Out in the morning light
But now your cheeks so silent and pale
And you only walk at night

Oh yes, the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom

Then she left me there as I Iay in a thirst
That water could not quell
And her voice was sad and soft in her throat
As she bid me last farewell

And now the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom

// Wella Hella //

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

Now, I've been sittin' just right here
And you've been sittin' over there all night
And it's getting late
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Why must you hesitate?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

I can shimmy and shing-a-ling
Bunny hop and shake a thing alright
If you take a chance
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Don't you wanna dance?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

Now tell me, honey, is it Mary Anne
Mary Ellen, Peggy Sue, or Jean
Or Etta Loreen?
What am I gonna call you
When you're in my dreams?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

// I Just Want You To Know //

Don't you know, when you're sad
And all your sweet dreams are bad
A little sunshine, and your garden will grow
I just want you to know

When you're down, what you need
Is a good friend, and call on me
'Cause I could find you wherever you go
I just want you to know

Sometimes I don't talk about it
But you're wrong to ever doubt it
'Cause my love is so strong
And I've been here for so long

You don't know how I feel
And that my love for you is real
When you cry, you don't cry alone
I just want you to know

I just want you to know
I just want you to know
