// Look At Miss Ohio //

Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She's a running around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the rag-top down
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
An' mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with the rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right , but not right now
Oh, I want do right but not right now

// Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor //

Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
When I'm broke and I got nowhere to go

Been hanging 'round with a good-time friends of mine
Hanging around with a good-time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime

Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me

Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride

So, make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
I'm broke and I got nowhere to go

// Wayside / Back In Time //

Standing on the corner
With a nickel or a dime
There use to be a rail car
To take you down the line

Too much beer and whiskey
To ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville
It was too much soldiers joy

Wasted on the wayside
Wasted on the way
If I don't go tomorrow
You know I'm gone today

Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Black highway all night ride
Watching the times fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
Is comin' in loud and my mind let go

Peaches in the summertime
Apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time
I won't have none at all

Oh, I wish I was in Frisco
In a brand new pair of shoes
'Cause I'm sittin' here in Nashville
With Norman's Nashville blues

So come all you good time rounders
Listenin' to my sound
And drink a round to Nashville
Before they tear it down

Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Hard weather, drivin' slow
Buggies and the hats in town for the show
Oh darlin', the songs they played
All I got left is the love we made

Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

// I Had A Real Good Mother And Father //

I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now are in bright glory
And are sleeping on the Savior's breast

They set a good example for me
And they taught me how to pray
Now I truly converted
And walking on the narrow way

I know that if I cannot meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity

I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the Savior's breast

// No One Knows My Name //

Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
And my dad was passin' through doing things a man will do
And my mother was just a girl, seventeen

It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
And I have a life to claim though I really don't know my name
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all

Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But it's written up in the sky and I'll see it by and by
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name

Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
And they took me to their breast and they surely stood the test
Yes, I had a good mother and dad just the same

Now there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Just another baby born to a girl lost and lorn
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name

Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
And on the crowded street I see a strangers face that looks like me
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind

'Cause there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But I'll see it by and by 'cause it's written up in the sky
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name

// Lowlands //

Saw a girl on the street from my home
Like a fire on the hillside she shown
And I knew right then that my best days were gone
And I'd been, been in the lowlands too long

Oh I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long

This is not how it was at the start
There's a doubt and a blame in my heart
And it's no one else, no fault but my own
And I've been in the lowlands too long

Oh I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long

What is this weight in my mind
And what is this new sense of time
It's the open fields and the friends that are gone
And I've been in the lowlands too long

I can sing out at all sing a song
I can do nothing all the day long
But I can't do right and I know I'm wrong
And I've been in the lowlands too long

Oh I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long

// I Made A Lovers Prayer //

I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer

Then watched the sky
Then wanted to cry
So only you and I
And how I try

I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer

Help me rise above
What I'm thinking of
Just a little more love
Just a little more love

I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer

// Wrecking Ball //

Look out boys, 'cause I'm a rollin' stone
That's what I was when I first left home
I took every secret that I'd ever known
And headed for the wall
Like a wrecking ball

Started down on the road to sin
Playin' bass under a pseudonym
The days were rough and it's all quite dim
But my mind cuts through it all
Like a wrecking ball

Oh, just a little deadhead
Who is watching, who is watching?
I's just a little deadhead
I won a dollar on a scholarship
Well, I got tired and let my average slip
Then I's a farmer in the pogonip
Where the weed that I recall
Was like a wrecking ball

I met a lovesick daughter of the San Joaquin
She showed me colors I'd never seen
Drank the bottom out of my canteen
Then left me in the fall
Like a wrecking ball

Standin' there, in the morning mist
A Jack and Coke at the end of my wrist
Yes, I remember when first we kissed
Though it was nothing at all
Like a wrecking ball

Hey boys, just a little deadhead
Who's watching, who's watching?
I's just a little deadhead
With too much trouble for me to shake
Oh, the weather and the blindin' ache
Was ridin' high until the '89 quake
Hit the Santa Cruz garden mall
Like a wrecking ball
