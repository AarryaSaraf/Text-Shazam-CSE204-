Album: Renegades

// Microphone Fiend //

Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, " Yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, Cuz it's sort of...an addiction,
Magnatized by the mixing

But back to the problem, I gotta habit,
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone.
Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

// Pistol Grip Pump //

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

I was raised in the hood called what the diff
Where the brothers in the hood be chivalrous
So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin' it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap its on your lips so trap shut
A steel dick more flick for pump but
All I'm saying ain't no question who the man is
In my civic or in this show biz
I drill the fool, kill the fool
Come on what you say?
I think I can take care of all you motherfuckers don't delay right away

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?
Cause tricks be out for your blindside
Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin' high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
If you ain't got none now, sucker
They gotta know you styles around me
Weren't we getting along? We're family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back, kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns (all right, man)

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas' shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

// Kick Out The Jams //

We're gonna kick 'em out


Well I feel pretty good

And I guess that I could get crazy now' baby

We all got in tune

When the dressing room got hazy


I know how you want it

When you're hot and tight

The girl cant stand it

When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand

And then they kick out the jams

Kick out the jams, We're gonna kick 'em out


And I'm starin' to sweat

You know my shirt's all wet

What a feeling now baby

And the sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'

You gotta have it baby

You cant do without

You get that feelin' gotta kick 'em out

Put that mic in my hand

And let me kick out the jams

Yeah, kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out


Got to get it up

You know you can't get enough Miss McKenzie

'Cause it gets in your brain

It drives you insane' a loopy frenzy

We got a guitar and a crash on the drums

If you wanna keep on rockin' till the mornin' comes

Let me be who I am

And let me kick out the jams

I done kicked 'em out

// Renegades Of Funk //

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now

We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet earth kept going through changes
And then the Renaissance came and times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like
Zulu nation
Revelations
Destroy our nations
Destroy our nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades we're the people
With our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
C'mon
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

Say jam sucker (jam)
Say jam sucker (jam)
Say groove sucker (groove)
Say groove sucker (groove)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Now move sucker (move)
Now move sucker (move)
[x2]

We're the renegades of funk

// Beautiful World //

It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care makes me want to say 
It's a beautiful world
Oh what a beautiful world 
For you

It's a wonderful time to be here 
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair makes me want to say 
It's a wonderful place 
Oh what a wonderful place
For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, not me

// I'm Housin //

Coolin on the scene like a horse in a stable

A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable

I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing

I Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring

I had an ace in the hole when it came to that

Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped

Posse kept rollin it was hard to get with 'em

So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim

They kept coming, just like I figured

So I stepped back, and started sprayin niggaz

What a way to go out, out like a sucker

But I'm on track, like a Long Island train

that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing

Always on my jock like a snake always hissing

Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross

Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast

Givin best wishes to the best MC

And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me

Because I'm housin 

'Cause I'm housin

Because I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

Because I'm housin


Because I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb


Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco

Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco

Move...

To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco

Gimme the cue, check one two

Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo

You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild

Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul

MC's, you know who you are

On the bandwagon Why Z? Cuz you a star

This is the year when the joker's are wild

When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style

I get hip to the scheme, before it happens

If it gets wild, then I start cappin

But for now, since everything's calm

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Because I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

Because I'm housin


C'mon


Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

'Cause I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Because I'm housin

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb


Because I'm housin


Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin)

Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin)

Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin)

Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin)

'Cause I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

'Cause I'm housin

// In My Eyes //

You tell me you like the taste

You just need an excuse

You tell me it calms your nerves

You just think it looks cool

You tell me you want to be different

You just change for the same

You tell me it's only natural

You just need the proof

Did you fucking get it?


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


And it doesn't look that way to me

In my eyes

And it doesn't look that way to me

In my eyes


You tell me that nothing matters

You're just fucking scared

You tell me that I'm better

You just hate yourself

You tell me that you like her

You just wish you did

You tell me that I make no difference

Well at least I'm fucking trying

What the fuck have you done?


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


It's in my eyes

It's in my eyes


And it doesn't look that way to me

In my eyes 

And it doesn't look that way to me

In my eyes

// How I Could Just Kill A Man //

Hey don't miss out on what you're passing,
you're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha,
eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
so come on as I start to kick it,
'Cause we're like outlaws striding while suckers are hiding,
jump behind the bush when you see me driving by
hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putas
acting kind of loco I'm just another local
kid from the street getting paid for my vocals.
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I be doing all the dumb shit yo
'Cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
humming coming at ya! Then you know I had to gat ya!
time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
in to your sattle light shining a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
here's an example just a little sample:
how could I just kill a man
one time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on. Take cover son or you're assed out
how do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay
so I just killed a man

here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
one of the many missions that I have to establish
to lite my spliff ignite you with incite so if you ain't down
bullshit. Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!
yeah you know I'm going to gat ya. How do you know where I'm at
when you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from.
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome,
just for a bucket or a fast ducket,
just to stay alive yo I got to say fuck it.

here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man.

Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,

How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man

// The Ghost Of Tom Joad //

Man walks along the railroad track

He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back 

The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge

Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge

The shelter line stretchin' around the corner

Welcome to the New World Order

Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest

No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!


And The highway is alive tonight

Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes

I'm sitting down here in the campfire light

Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad


He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag

The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag

He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last

In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass

With a one way ticket to the promised land

With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand

Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock

Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts


And The highway is alive tonight

Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes 

I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light

With the Ghost of old Tom Joad


Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy

Wherever a hungry new born baby cries

Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air

Look for me ma' 

I'll be there

Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand

For a decent job or a helpin' hand

Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free

Look in their eyes ma, 

You'll see me! [repeat 8 times]


And the highway is alive tonight

nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes

I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light

With the Ghost of Tom Joad.

// Down On The Street //

Down on the street where the faces shine

Floatin' around i'm a real low mind

See a pretty thing in a wall

See a pretty thing in a wall


In a wall

In a wall

In a wall


Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love

Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love

A thousand eyes they look at you

A thousand eyes they, they look at you


Oh Come On! [x3]

Yeah Yeah Yeah
[repeat]


Oh Come On! [x3]

Yeah Yeah Yeah


Where faces shine

A real low mind

Faces Shine

Oh Come On! [x3]

Fold my hands and pray for rain.

I ain't gonna work for, nah

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more


I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

His bedroom window

It is made out of bricks

The National Guard stands around his door

I ain't gonna work, nah 

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more


I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

To be just like I am

But everybody wants you

To be just like them

They sing while they slave and just get bored

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
