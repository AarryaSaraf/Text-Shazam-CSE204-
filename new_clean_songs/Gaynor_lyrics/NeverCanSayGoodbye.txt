// Never Can Say Goodbye //

I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core

It says, "Turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more"
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go!

Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

I never can say goodbye
Oh, no, I
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt

It's that same old dizzy hang-up
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so?
I don't wanna let you go!

Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, oo

Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no

Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, no, no, no, baby
Hey, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no
Please don't make me say good-bye

Hey, I never can say goodbye

// Reach Out (I'll Be There) //

Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all your hope is gone 
And your life is filled with confusion 
And happiness is just an illusion 
And your world around is tumblin' down 
Darling, reach out 
Reach out, for me. 

I'll be there to love and comfort you...(tell me baby) 
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through 

Now when you're lost and about to give up 
'cause your best just ain't good enough 
And you feel the world has grown cold 
And you're driftin' on your own 
When you need a hand to hold 
Darling, reach out 
Reach out, for me. 

I'll be there to love and comfort you 
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through 

I'll be there to love and comfort you 
I'll be there to with the love I'll see you through 

I can tell you the way I hang your head 
Now with out of love, now you're afraid 
And through your tears you look around 
But there's no peace of mind to be found 

I know what you're thinking 
Without love, now you're alone 
Baby, reach out 
Reach out for me 

I'll be there to love and comfort you 
I'll be there with the Love I'll see you through 

I'll be there to love and comfort you 
Tell me baby 
I'll be there to always see you through 
I'll be there 

I'll be there to love and comfort you 
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through.

// All I Need Is Your Sweet Lovin' //

Precious darling you know you're my man
All you got to do is wave your hand
Yes, I cherish all you got to give
I don't need nothing' else to live

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love

Taste that honey flowin' from your lips
I start shakin' from your fingertips
glowin' steady, movin' right on time
Feel so warm in these arms of mine

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love

Now darlin' when I'm with you
Say it feels so good inside
It's just makin' love to you
I'm so satisfied

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love
Yeah, baby

// Searchin' //

Got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working

I thought our love was strong and true
Until I read your note who made me so blue
And now dark clouds form all over my head
It looks like rain, it's rainin' above

I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
I got to keep on searchin'
Until I find you
Explain it to you

Really lost this time, a love so true
And memories of how it was, it makes me so blue
And now dark clouds all begin to cry
It looks like rain, it's raining from my eyes

I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
I got to keep on searchin'
Until I find you
Explain it to you
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
...

// We Belong Together //

Sometimes you say you love me
Sometimes you say you need me, baby
But then you're always leaving me
I need your love, not just sympathy

I know you don't really care
But then you always swear
That you and I were meant to be
Oh, you tell me

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

So many times I tried
To bring you closer to me, baby
I tried to make you see
How happy you and I can be

I know I'm wasting my time
But you keep giving me that same old line
That you and I were meant to be
Oh, you tell me

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

// False Alarm //

Hey diddle diddle, I'm in the middle
I thought you ran away with my heart
Oh, Mother Mary is quite the contrarian
The fire never really got a chance to start
Now you might think I'm crazy
To say these things so fast
Thought I'd fallen in love again
And long it won't go and last
But it was only a...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Knew I'd lose you, I suppose
But you're still the one I chose

I get excited when love's invited
To play another game with my heart
Think nothin' of it, you know I love it
Cause we'll have a lot of fun before we have to part
Now you may think I'm crazy
To speak of love like this
But if you find a guy so sweet
With looks as good as his
You'd rush right into a...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
From the start I shoulda known
You would never be my own
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run

Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run

I must confess, this has happened to me before
Falling in love with new and old friends
In fact, it's happened about 50 times!
There's another pretty face
And well, there I go, off to another...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Knew I'd lose you, I suppose
But you're still the one I chose
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
