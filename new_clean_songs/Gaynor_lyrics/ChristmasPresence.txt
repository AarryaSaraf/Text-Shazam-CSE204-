// God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen //

God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of god by name

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

"Fear not", then said the angel
"Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of virtue, power, and might
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite"

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm, and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed babe to find

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

// All I Want Is You For Christmas //

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby

// Frosty The Snowman //

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe
And a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we?ll have some fun now
Before I melt away?

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler, "Stop"

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

// Do You Hear What I Hear //

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees with a voice as big as the sea with a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king, do you know what I know
A child, a child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere, listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere, listen to what I say
A child, a child, sleeping in the night, he will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

// Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! //

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold
And the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Ooh, wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry
When he's nice and warm?
His girl by his side
And the lights turned low
He just says, let it snow, let it snow
I don't care

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But that fire is, mmm, delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow

When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

// O Holy Night //

Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

// Little Town Of Bethlehem //

O little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above they deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

O holy child of Bethlehem descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel

For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on Earth

// Winter Wonderland //

Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking
In a winter wonderland

Gone away
Is the bluebird
Here to stay
Is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down

When it's cold
Ain't it thrilling
When your nose
Gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play
The eskimo way
Walking
In a winter wonderland

Walking
In a winter wonderland

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some
Mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
