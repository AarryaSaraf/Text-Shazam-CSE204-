// Roll With My Baby //

Went to see my sweetheart
Last night around about ten
She said, "Home sweet, Papa"
Squeeze me every now and then

I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

We went out to a movie
Stop in the very last row
We hadn't been there a good five minutes
Before she's ready to go

I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime
Can't buy me no whiskey
I guess I'll have to settle for wine
And then I can

Roll with my baby
I know I can roll with my baby
I'm sure I can roll with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

She's such a sweet woman
I'll never let her go
'Cause deep down inside of me
Lord knows I love her so

I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
I'll keep rolling with my baby
'Cause she's sweet that way

// Tell All The World About You //

When I need company
I call on you to see about me
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

When you're with me, there's so much fun
You're all the good things all wrapped in one
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

Whoa, I wanna walk, walk about
I wanna talk, talk about
I wanna tell, wanna tell the world all about you

Ohh, I wanna live just for you
I'm gonna give love so true
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new

Ohh, You're so fine and you're so sweet
You're better at love than K.B.B1
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you

Ohh, I gonna live just for you
I'm gonna give love so true
We'll have a love, we'll have a love that's fine and new

Ohh, You're so fine and you're so sweet
You're better at love than K.B.B2
I wanna walk about it, talk about it
Tell all the world about, tell the world about you
Tell all the world about you, tell the world about you
