// Amnesia //

I believe in the darkness
It's just a sound
I'm in love with some sadness
It's just a sound
Ride with me

(Slipping through) My virtual magnet
(Kiss the rush of me and you) Automated bliss
Blinding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you

I'm in love with the darkness
It's just a sound
Nothing wrong with some sadness
It's just a sound
Ride with me

(Slipping through) My virtual magnet
(Kiss the rush of me and you) Automated bliss
Binding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you

So let's burn
Fast and bright
'Cause we will bleed
Die inside me
Floating for a miracle
Like pixies
Guide me to the last realm
This crimson love
It's a miracle

// Us And The Rest //

Dry heart
A loss of all desire
Flee to the moon hill

Bliss, you're it

Night of gold
Incoming

Hello, freak
Can you see the sky ladder
By the limbo café
Leading to the green ray?
Sometimes it fades

Night of gold
Incoming
Night of gold
Incoming

Night of gold
Incoming
Night of gold
Incoming

// Earth To Sea //

I'm new as a cloud
Mm-mm
I light up as neon
Where will you go?
Where will you go? Just say it
You can let go

I heard of a legend
And that's where I go
If my sister calls
Tell her I'm diving into the deeper end

To the edge of wonder
Where the wire stretches
'Cause where I go
'Cause where I go it's trembling
'Cause where you go
'Cause where you go it's haunted
Goodbye stranger

I heard of a legend
Where the others go
If my sister calls
Tell her I love her
Until the end of us
To the living dreams
I think I'm falling into the deeper end

Hidden fortress
Happy to see you
Now when I scream
No one can hear me
The deeper end
I fucking love it
Ooh, oh
Release your soul
Before you know it
May all of me
Be forgotten

// Radar, Far, Gone //

Everyone already knew your name
It's written in the clouds
It's like you talk to them in dreams
It's like you know our signs, right?

Keep looking
Stand by
Cross a blue ridge
Slow car

You don't have to show your face
We only look inside, you see
It's like you only talk in tears
It's like you know our fears, right?

Stop looking
Come by
Is it our last chance
To be friends?

Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh

// Deceiver //

Distant writer
I can read my destiny through you
Everybody, "He's my writer"
He makes my world flow

Distance driver
Can you see it all?
Can you breathe it all?
Everybody, "He's my writer"
He turns me on

// Fantasy //

Shout it!
Fantasy
Shout it!
Fantasy

Into a fantasy
Into a wasteland

Living in a fantasy

Shout it!
Fantasy
Shout it!
Fantasy

Into a fantasy
Into a wasteland

Living in a fantasy

Turning

Living in a fantasy
Living

// Laura //

Hold us in your arms
We're not feeling much
The provenance of the call
Is where I want to be

'Cause when you hold us
It's electric
And when you lead us

Take us on a ride
I'll take you on a voyage through the night sky
Before we lose control
And it's OK to lose control it's time to fly
The distance of the soul
Well there's no distance, in the soul you are a limitless star
Is where I want to be
You're wrapped up tight with me

'Cause when you hold us
It's electric
And when you lead us

We look deep into the heavens
We are the planet makers

I am the mother of all
Over every galaxy
There is no one but me
I am the mother of all
Immortal energy
Faceless wonder

I am the mother of all
Over every galaxy
There is no one but me
I am the mother of all
Immortal energy
Faceless wonder

// Sunny Boy //

To which system does she belong?
Is she the girl called sunny boy?

Have you ever believed in?
I am star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
She's young and fierce
Have you ever kissed?
And I like her
Hmm, maybe I love her

Is that the same moon we love?
Why does this girl burn?
So long ago when we were born
A timeless sun, sun
Sun, love

Have you ever believed in?
I've been star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
She's young and fierce
Have you ever danced?
And I love her
With a tear falling

Have you ever done it?
Danger star-struck
Cosmic adrenaline
Such a radiant queen
Have you ever danced?
Hope she hits me
With a tear falling
Oh I love her

Can we just make it last?
Can we just make it last?
Can we just make it last?

// Kool Nuit //

Je suis...
Fille du feu et du vent...
Je voyage seule dans le temps...
Toute seule...
Regarde-moi... Reste un peu...

Prête-moi ton image...

Mélancolie
Pleurent mes nuits
Les visages et les voix
S'effacent...

Andy, tell me...
Presence
Andy, see me?
Presence

// Dismemberment Bureau //

All we want
Till the end of time
All we love
Till the end of time

Do you miss the day
Of human revolution
What a good way to learn
From the hand of a legend
An illusion
On color television
What a good way to learn
About us
And the heirs of our land

All we want
Till the end of time
All we love
Till the end of time

Do you miss the day
Of human revolution
What a good way to learn
From the hand of a legend
An illusion
On color television
What a good way to learn
Good way to learn
About us
And the heirs of our land

An illusion
Television
An illusion
Television
