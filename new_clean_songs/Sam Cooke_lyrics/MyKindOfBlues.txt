// Don't Get Around Much Anymore //

Missed the saturday dance
I heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
I don't get around much anymore

Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up old memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
I don't get around much anymore

O, I miss that saturday dance
But I heared they flooded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

So I thought I'd visit the club
But I only got as far as the door
Someone will have asked me about you
I don't get around much anymore

Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up old memories

Been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
I don't get around much anymore

// Little Girl Blue //

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
So sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue, whoa

Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you
It's time you knew
That all, all you count is the raindrops
That's falling on
Little blue girl

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

// Out In The Cold Again //

The song that you sang so sweetly
you called it our love refrain
now it's gone and I am left completely
I'm out in the cold again

I dreamed that our love would linger
but just, just memories remain
I gaze at a ringless finger
looks like I'm out in the cold again

so true, it hurts my pride
to step aside for somebody new
o but, deep down inside
my whole world depended on you

I wanted your arms around me
to shelter, to shelter me from the rain
oh but now I back where I started
oh, I'm out in the cold again
oh, I'm out in the cold again
one more time
I'm out in the cold again

// But Not For Me //

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds of grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I know she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I'm so well aware she's not for me

// Exactly Like You //

I know why I waited
know why I've been blue
I've been praying for someone, baby
exactly like you
why should we spend money, on a show or two
while no one does those love scenes, baby
exactly like you

you make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
you seem to understand
each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
and the schemes I'm scheming

now I know why mother taught me to be true
she meant me for someone, baby
exactly like you

just like you, baby, oh
just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you

I know why I waited
know why I been blue
I've been waiting for someone, baby
exactly like you
why should we spend money on a show or two
while no one does those love scenes, baby
exactly like you

you make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
you seem to understand
each foolish little dream I'm dreaming
and the schemes I'm scheming
now I know why mother taught me to be true
she meant me for someone
exactly like you

just like you, baby, just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you
just like you, baby, pretty just like you
mother meant me for someone exactly like you

// I'm Just A Lucky So And So //

as I walk down the street
everyone that I meet
gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

the birds in every tree
they are so neighborly
they sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

but if you ask the amount
in my bank account
I'll have to admit I'm kinda slipping
but that don't bother me
'cause confidentially
I have a dream that is pippin

and when the day is through
each night I hurry to
home where my love waits, I know
I guess I'm, I gotta be a lucky so and so

but if you ask the amount
in my in my bank account
I'll have to admit that I'm slipping
but I know that don't bother me
'cause confidentially
I've got a dream that is pippin

and when the day is through
each night I hurry to
home where my love waits, I know
I guess I'm, I gotta be a lucky so and so

I guess, I know I'm a lucky lucky
lucky so and so

// Since I Met You Baby //

Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
All my friends tell me 
I'm not the same
Let me tell you 
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
Looks like I'm a happy man

I'm gonna try and please you
In every way that I can
Let me tell you

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to

Oh, 'cause since I met you baby
All I need is you
And oh, pretty baby
You know I love you baby
Better than I do myself
When I'm with you
I don't need nobody else
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
When you love me
I hope everything is allright

// Baby, Won't You Please Come Home //

Baby won't you please come home
cause your bed is alone
I have tried so hard in vain
Nevermore to call your name.
When you left, you broke my heart,
oh darling why do have to part.
Every hour in the day you can hear me say,
Baby, won't you please come home?

I mean, baby, won't you please come home?
cause  your dad is so alone
I tried so hard in vain
nevernomore to call you name
now when you left me you just broke my heart
why did we have to part
every hour in the day
people way across the street
if you loved me you better come home

// Trouble In Mind //

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I got that trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living
Sometimes I feel like dying

Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm going to lay,
On some lonesome, railroad line
And let two-ten train
Ease my trouble in mind

Meanwhile I got that
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

If things don't get better
I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take my old rocking chair
And if the blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I'm not worried cause I know
I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

I know the sun's going to shine
In my back door someday

// The Song Is Ended //

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
and the melody seemed to say
O, summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may
There beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended and I found at the break of dawn
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on
but the melody lingers on
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
and the melody seemed to say
O, summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may
There beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon
The moon descended and I found at the break of dawn
That you and the sun are gone
but the melody lingers on
