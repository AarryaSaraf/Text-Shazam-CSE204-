I put the feline in my hair, looking like a cheetah pet
And you know they getting green if a flower on they neck
If a flower on they neck hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gassin' niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passion fruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the Gramm's, one nom ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again, yuh
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy
Getting to the paper better re-up on the chalkboard
Because the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'm a god nigga ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yuh
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tired like a long day
Big dollars, the scent Prada
Skinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me
If you see me out in public, no pictures don't record me
I don't really fuck with y'all niggas, selfish at the orgy, uh

Bitch
One take
Yuh

// Automatic Driver (Tyler, The Creator Remix) //

In time, will I
Understand it?
We can fight till it's light
Doesn't mend it
Too many times
You're my baby
Too many times we've been high
You're my baby

I wanted to manage information
Find the automatic driver
Oh, we'll find her
Ooh, but I'm still so in love
Imagine how much I'm crying
Oh, I'm crying, ooh, ooh

Do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do

Too many times (Woo, woo)
You're my baby (Look)
Too many times we've been high
You're my baby
We can try all you like
But it's ending
And next time we're in paradise
You're my baby

I wanted to make a contribution, baby
I wanted to start a revolution with you
I wanted to make a contribution, baby
I wanted to start a revolution with you, oh-oh-oh

After I waited so long to find you
Why did I let myself run and hide you?
After I waited so long to find you
Why did I let myself run?

I wanted to make a contribution, baby (After I waited so long to find you)
I wanted to start a revolution with you (Why did I let myself run and hide you?)
I wanted to make a contribution, baby (After I waited so long to find you)
I wanted to start a revolution with you, oh-oh-oh (Why did I let myself run?)

Yeah, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-oh-oh
After I waited so long, oh-oh-oh
Why did I let myself run? Oh-oh-oh
After I waited so long
Why did I let myself run? Oh-oh-oh

// Batman (Freestyle) //

Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Robin, and I'm giving to the poor Mike Tyson
Don't drink extavia bitch I put rice in
Here bitch, Ziploc bag filled with my dick
Give it to your parents and tell them that it's a nice gift
Of my semen, futures as I'm a psychic
Do you wanna ride? Because I don't know where my bike is
I've lost my mind
Can somebody page Amanda Bynes and maybe she can help me find it?
Pink and blue all on my neck, fuck I'm blinded
I'm a nigga bitch, bring that pink pale pussy here and take some nigga dick
Spitting, get it cracking like some nigga lips
Bad to the bone, I don't know where my appendix is
I'm kidding it's right here
In the pocket of them pants covered in white smears
Engine to my left, Clipse plays in my right ear
When I steer that third gear, people fear when I drive here
I'm fast motherfucker in a whole other lightyear, what's up?

Yo, that flow is sick
(Yeah)
I'm going to figure out how to do some shit

// BEST INTEREST //

Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It's just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my brain, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (You don't have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you

I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side better
I'm a home wrecker
Give it up
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side better
I'm a home wrecker
Give it up, give it up, give it up

I'll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your best interest
I'll keep your best interest

I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I'm the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures (Click-click-click-click)
(I won't tell anybody, it's our secret)
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is seesaw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I would never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I'll carry the weight 'til my hands sore
(We can't keep doing this)

I'll keep your, your best interest (It's our secret)
I'll keep your best interest
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)

// Bring It Back (Remix) //

[Trouble:]
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout them stack
'Cause I will blow ya back, bring it back, this ho here throw it back

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo, Converse selling out they got their thumbs tied
Re-up on my deal let's make it 1-5
And I ain't talking point that gorilla if I point
He gon' get you that's the point no lie
Hit the gas and we outta there (skrt)
Like it's mountain wear
Lately, I've been dolo in this bitch
Shout out Solo that's big sis
Shout out Frankie that's big bro
Ya lil' homie running shit no question
Casio the mothafuckin' watch
800 in a day, my boy that's just one drop
Invest in stocks that's the other plan
Two-story bed I hit the running man
Baby boy no photo
Long sleeve my polo
Casio no Rolo'
Parmesan my bolo
VVS my necky, necky heavy flooded
We done broke them levees anything for Fetti
But don't let it get to you
These niggas tripping they shoe in the gutter
They gonna ruin their future with shit that they doing like
Flexin' on the 'Gram about a bank deposit (hmm)
Yeah that shit addicting, shit is hypnotizing (hmm)
Claiming that you rich like bitch we know you lying (yuh)
What yo backyard look like? What yo mama driving?
Mane, call me flame
I'm lighting niggas, I'm an animal, fuck is tame?
Young wild nigga it's the WANG (it's them GOLF boys)
G boy, geez boy, he that boy, boy, you a decoy (yuh)
Fuck boy, heard you want beef, bitch you eat soy
Us and them, and we ain't got time, bitch I'm Pink Floyd, yuh
Sapphire's gelatin, niggas is repetitive
AmEx 'cause my pockets is what I can't fit my cheddar in
Sleeping on me sedative
Who these niggas better than?
Is the answer me? Hmm uh no, negative
Yuh

[Trouble (Tyler, The Creator):]
Ounces in my mothafuckin' pantry (yeah)
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancin', yeah
Just dropped some bandos on some glasses, yeah (Golf boys in this shit)
Just dropped your bitch off, man, that hoe so nasty (Shout out to Trouble)
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat, yeah
(Shout out to Drake, shout out to Mike WiLL)
I'ma get some Cho-Cho, one thing 'bout me, yeah
Gossip all that hoe shit, miss me with that
I could put you front line, just bring it back

// BRONCO //

[Tyler, The Creator:]
I might just add a verse for no reason, fuck it
Ayo

I sit in my garden and play Stevie Wonder
And get foot massages while Clancy talk numbers
He threw me some game and I swear I won't fumble
Might cop me a Bronco to ride for the summer
Marni the trousers, tell Risso to holla
The carnival sell out, the stadium Dodger
Cut off some homies, but Taco my brodie
Until he score millions, I won't leave the goalie
Pass 'em the mittens, he never betrayed me
The E30 sitting, the LT my daily
The engine is stupid, I drive like a tutor
When I move, it moves, the transmission like Luda
Ketchup like packets, my new nigga pretty
Your new bitch is tacky like Busta Rhymes jackets
Want smoke? I can match it, that second-hand action
We exhale you inhale and asthma attack
Teeing off, niggas nauseous as fuck, fuck you thought?
Bitch, it's GOLF

[Lil Baby:]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Tyler, The Creator:]
This shit going crazy, I swear I go crazy
I never met him but man shout out Lil Baby
We running the thing [?] I just ran out of words

// BROWN SUGAR SALMON //

Good day, Sir Baudelaire, what can I do for you?

Oh, dude, I am so fucking hungry, and I just want to eat
Can I get the, can I get the brown sugared salmon?

Mkay, so our dinner plates this evening are the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon

Heh, yeah, I know, I want, I want the brown sugared salmon please
With the, with the potatoes, and I don't, I don't want Brussels sprouts

Mmm, I'm so sorry, we are out of that
The chef actually ran out of salmon because there was a trivial boat shortage at the lake so...

So why did you mention it in the first place?

Because that's our specials

Okay, alright, cool
Let me just get the ehm, the braised bohemian beef with the potatoes, and I don't...

Oh, Mr. Baudelaire, I'm gonna have to check if we have the braised bohemian beef

Are you fucking dumb?

I'm just gonna have to double check that we have that

Who's who's running this place? Who's in charge here?

I'm in charge Mr. Baudelaire, and thank you so much for traveling with us
Is there a dilemma I can sort out?

I'm starving, and I just want dinner

Oh, well, our dinner specials are the braised bohemian beef, and the brown sugared salmon

I know, I fucking know, and this lady keeps on telling me that-

Oh, ah, my name's Trina, sir

Okay, well, Trina Sir, keeps saying "It's no salmon, it's no beef, it's no anything", I just want...

It's not "No anything" Mr. Baudelaire, it's the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon

I think he's leaning towards the beef

Trina, would you quadruple check if we have the beef?

Yes... Mmmm, we do not have the braised bohemian beef

Oh jeez, I'm so sorry Mr. Baudelaire, I have just got word, that we are in fact out of the braised bohemian beef
But, we are now serving complimentary yogurt
Now, would you like strawberries or granola?

Oh-oh, oh, we are out of the yogurt

// Come On, Let's Go //

I'm downstairs
Fuck you mean?
Girl

I told your ass be ready
You always got excuses and you know I be on top of things
Punctual my proper name
On the dot is not your aim
Although we in love, we are not the same
I hit you on that celly
You said you needed five, that was more than twelve ago
Claim you got your hands tied
Time stuck like velcro
Georgia peach on east side like it's ATL, hoe

You lacking, you tripping, you slacking
Impatient, be waiting
Confused like what happened?
You get an attitude 'cause I'm getting mad
'Cause you wanna take twenty minutes and a half
On top of that, I gotta get gas
Ah, the freeway picked up traffic
What the fuck is you doin'?
We gotta dip, dip, dip, dip, dip
Cartier-yay-yay-yay
Watch go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
Waiting for that last minute for your goddamn hair
Now stop playin' games, girl
And bring yo' ass downstairs

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Took me twenty to get ready
Shower, moisturizer, and the fit I had on yesterday
Uniform necessities
Multiples of e'rything
Now your neighbor wanna come and speak to me like
(Hey, how you doin'?) I'm good
(I ain't too bad) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Hit 'em with a few fake laughs
She talking my ear off, and sympathy I lack
I care about one thing
Where the fuck you at?

Anyway, I gotta pay a little more
See, I'm late to the jet, gotta jet 'cause I'm building an ape
And we got supper on the upper deck and the orchestra gon' play the score
For El Diablo projects
You ain't scared to change 'cause this ain't coming out your pockets
My Freudian slip, I'm rude a little bit
Don't be acting so appalled, all your girls love this shit
Put so much into tonight and you just don't care
Now stop playing games, girl, and bring your ass downstairs

Come on, girl, let's go
Come on, girl, let's go
Girl, you know that time that you wasting
That time that you wasting
That time that you wasting's on my dime

Tonight, just don't care
Stop playing games, girl, and bring your ass downstairs
Where the fuck you at?

// CRUST IN THEIR EYES //

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo, ayo
It's like 3 AM in Denmark
Watching movies and cartoons, heh

[Yasiin Bey:]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah, that's the king

[Tyler, The Creator:]
My sister called the other day and said she loved me, wassup?
I called her back and said I'm sorry I don't say it enough
See I don't put up a front, I just say what I want, nigga
Never let a nigga tell me I couldn't stunt, uh
Pro black but this twink white (white)
I'll sign if the ink right (right)
Two cribs, I can sleep twice (twice)
Niggas swear they woke but got crust in their eyes
They can't blink right (woo!)
These niggas fake confidence and fake show how they feel
Then go home and big cry because that acne is real
Show them scars motherfucker
How you think they gon' heal up?
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me
That I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them
It ain't no hate in my heart
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves (rip)
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas
Just stay tuned and watch em
I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs
Niggas picking out their victims, hot potato, hot potato
Tryna' cancel me on Twitter, but got limits on ya' data
Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters

[Yasiin Bey:]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah, that's the king

// Cult Shit //

I'm recordin' that shit on the fuckin' little mic
By the little camera thing on the fuckin' Mac book
So this shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it
Wolf Gang, Ace Creator

Somebody tell Justin Bieber that I'm fuckin' coming
Ain't no point in runnin', I'm a nigga, just a little quicker
So I catch him stretchin', have him guessin' where his cracker throat
Chop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat
Ain't he dope? No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote
This is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke
Riley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike
She won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite
Apprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin
Make Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes
Wrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound
That doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns
This my album, and when your parents try to come around
Do the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down
And when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud
Tell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud
Then start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down
But call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour
Tell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower
But make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power
This is the shit that is makin' me cynical
The clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical
Fuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll
O.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general
So when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal
The coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll
Life is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll
1-800-fuck-this-shit
Seven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold
But when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul
It's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals
Out the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol
And a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime
In a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine
Wolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time
The fuck I give is the same as the next line

(Fuck everything) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
So the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

// Diaper //

Got a problem with the Golf? Fuck it, then pick a spot
Like you're eating lunch and it's brunch, we could bring the beef
And the pots and the pans, fuck it we could bring a lot
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or not?
Hit her up, pick her up in the front seat of my two seater vehicle
Hit the crib, grab the cuffs, take pictures of her butt
Where's your mouth open up?
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or what
The fuck am I yapping about? It don't matter
I'm the one, hun, T is the sun and you're Saturn
Better stop with all of the chit chatter, bitch I'm the tongue
I go dumblike the mental handicaps in the house
Y'all kiss butt like a nap on the couch
T the shit, I'm the weird little BLAH in your mouth
You better brush like Hova shoulder
Told you boys it never stop
I just want to know if you gon' come and suck a dick or not?
Pink and yellow in the fit, yeah
Ballin' now shit I wonder how I got here
Thanks to everyone whoever gave a fuck, yeah
A lot of niggas don't know because I am, yeah
They told me to sit down, shit, I hate chairs
Fuck that instead I stood on their table
Flog Gnaw carnival, fuck ya' state fair
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with T, man
Golf boys y'all ain't fuckin with me, man
Golf boys sorta like Stevie Wonder, niggas can't see me
I'm the man nigga don't trip unless you got your bags
Gotta say shit nigga fuck you and that's it nigga

[Charlie Wilson & Channel Tres:]
It's my fault

I'm realizing it's my bad, you know?
It's my fault
These niggas is takin' they own, these niggas is takin' they time
They tryna get they own [?]
It's my fault

// Fuck It //

Yo, I've seen a lot of niggas
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended
I get it, they try to keep a image
But look real closely at the pictures and you see that they're chameleons
How you doin'?
You in the motherfucking building?
Nigga, I'm a architect, got another crane and I don't know if I'mma park it yet, you ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?
Is it 'cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?
I think people love to be mad
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion
Still trying to come out
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out
Probably 'cause I like to be in places where the sun out
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out
Thought y'all niggas nudists but y'all clothes
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt 'til the end
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys 'cause I don't fuck with my friends
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen
Look, freedom of speech? My freedom was breached
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately
For shit I said when I was a virgin repeatedly
Posting on Hypebeast 'cause nobody would listen to me
My child is a product of me, very honest
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards
Diverse and loud, so they ignored us
You put your life in a child that everybody hates
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one
(Got kids, nigga?) Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating
Almost ate my spirit 'til the children cheered along
Watching them sing the songs
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong
That's why I rode the McLaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer
"Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva
That nigga preaching and wildin', that nigga smilin' and breathing
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him
But fuck that! We want:
Cats cats daddy problems
Kick flip fuck fuck, cupcakes butt rape
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad"
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production nigga
Saying you the plug, get your chords up
I was writing string sections on my tour bus
They adore me, my little birds
Be free, go flap your wings, I encourage it
Look, I wish I had a fucking Xanax problem
So y'all talk about how I deep I am
Man-child in the flesh, bitch, I'm Peter Pan
You captain tier hook motherfuckers won't ever be the man
I got a motherfucking vision, I don't see your plans
So shut your motherfucking mouth when I be speaking, man
'Cause T the only sober nigga that be tweaking, fam

Fuck
I don't—I don't like rapping like that

// Fuck Love //

Yo, the only girl I ever loved
Fucked some nigga that I really hate
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice

I was in love, but fuck it

Dorothy, my everything
She was my everything
Sarah, my lady
Sarah, I love you

I was not cool, niggas thought that I was weird and shit, they kept they space
But it's cool, 'cause now I got they amazin' grace, nigga
How many M's? It don't matter how much I make

Flex send me emoji
No, there's no emoji, I didn't send an emoji, wait a minute

Especially 'cause the gap tooth, and I'm dark skinned
But my shit clearer than that ball from Space Jam

See them diamonds on my hand, why am I talkin' material shit?
I don't even care, but I'm just freestylin' this bitch, man

// Garbage //

Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell Molly and Mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding

Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake 'cause it's good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back

Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

What's in my trunk? White, girl
What's in my trunk? White, girl
You need a warrant, officer

You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven

Feel like you need some validation (Yeah, yeah)
I got a plan 'cause you're more than that
No better situation, girl

// Inside Of Clouds (Remix) //

[Tyler:]
Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth
What's it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin
And play some Sade "Love Deluxe" through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella
Why? Cause I really didn't wanna get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys and make a lotta noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate

[Pharrell:]
I can smell it when I go outside
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet
That's what rain's for

All the kids see rain and scream "No, no"
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat, that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the window
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'

[Tyler:]
Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up
And I won't be lyin' when I say I'm a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father
The only difference is it comes back, full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erected

[Pharrell:]
The inside of clouds
That's the window into the sky
Proves there's life

// Lucky Charms //

So many good reviews off of Bastard
I celebrated, getting masturbated by my pastor
Now he's in a plastic, on the kitchen table
Near a bowl of Lucky Charms and the newest Thrasher

When I say Wolf Gang, you say fuck that
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious butt cracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
Um, that's not a potato, give me my gun back
Before I blast bigger than pimples on Big Pun's back
Black fat bitches was washin' on my dishes
And using my large stick on her lips like my cum's chapped
I love Jews but I hate faggots
And bitches who be nagging about me taking the trash out
I got a fuckin' can of whoop ass, who wants to pack it
Going ape shit in the newest bape straight jacket
With six dicks of chap stick, sticking in my black lips
Six sippie cups full of sick shit enhancements
Wolf Gang spit right
Ain't been this much fuckin' crack rock music since free way had flip side
So get low, lower than a ditch
I'm with some retarded bitch, hoping she know how to kiss low
They know, I'm the clinic's aid and I'm sick
So they clap for me kinda like a herpe on the lip
With some tutor bitch, tryna tickle wetback hooter this
Bitch acting I still did not know with it
Until I put this cock on, the end of clitoris
Fucking this game I used this shit as spit as lubricant
So who you with? (Umm, fuck)
I got this fuckin' gun, you better say yes you stupid bitch
Before you lose your wrist and rich make you do some dick
I'm fucking crazy, well I guess I am if these shoes will fit
Fuck the Key club, they wanna ban 'em
I got fucking fans from Compton to Montana
To Indiana, where deaf dwarfs still don't understand 'em
Because yelling at midgets is like me beefing with brandUn (Fuck him)
Stomp 'em out, with these crab ass Nikes
Make it look like some slob, scribbled all on his white Tee
Invite me, come on, you got a better chance to getting Shake
My dad and Earl's motherfuckin' momma to like me (Bitch)
Animals is farming you, patrick this is barnacles
Said he gave Ace a spongejob at the carnival
And Spongebob got his head knocked from the piss that Ace got
Nigga's soft as baby cock and the cotton swab

This that fuck music, put your shit and fuck to it
Shouldn't give one when your bumping in the trunk to it
Grab a couple gats, stuff 'em in your backpack and then take 'em to school
For show and tell day screamin' "fuck students"
Locate the bitch that didn't wanna give you kiss
Then get her tits, then use your fists to add a couple lumps to it
Shoot the faculty for taking hats, you stupid butts
Skip the music teacher and the janitor you real cool with
Continue this procedure until lunch is through with
Go home out the back like a scared student
Keep a low pro, until you on your block
Then you just make it home in time for new news brief at 2ish
Stuck at all this bible study, shit is not fun
Me and wolf gang go jump nuns for hot fun
Playing with the bell when shots heard, and cops come
But I'm still punchin' this bitch out, I'm not done
Sittin' in my room masturbating
Truthful, these lyrics are relating like my dad did
I make music for teenagers and bad ass kids
Bastard touched more boys than your local church did
Killing these niggas off quick
Don't believe me then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard you bitch

// My Ego //

Tell Theresa May to let me in
I've been going in since 2010
It gotta be the color of my skin
Cause there's nigga's there
That doing more damage than my pen, man
Said some old lines was offensive
I was young, I can't apologize for that shit
They took my fiction literature for literal
I ain't no motherfuckin' criminal
The fuck is the problem, my record ain't got no smudges
Shit is clean as a whistle, and they just blow in them grudges
Let the kids see a show, that's what they waiting to see
It ain't no drugs on my bus, boy, my edges are straighter than me
So what the fuck is the problem? That lil Black boy made it
He's got a little bit of power and these white niggas hate it
And now he talking shit again, his stupid ass should have waited, fuck
They said I was a bad influence to who?
The camouflage following niggas like you?
Or all the free thinkers that know what it do?
Cause I'm one of them
See Ace is a king, I don't need your respect
So I made my own shoes, fuck that royalty check
I don't need your opinion, keep a mirror on deck
So don't you talk to me

It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego right now
Clancy you should calm me down
It's my ego
Or maybe it's my ego
It might just be my motherfuckin' ego

Well maybe it's my motherfuckin' ego when I'm ruling the world
And I ain't proving shit to niggas who just want me to fail
Niggas is fronting saying we distant cousins
While y'all pants was always flowing, all my trousers was flooded
Mad niggas be watching my moves, I never copped my props
For everybody and they momma got a problem with shock
Y'all niggas trash, y'all niggas trash (Goddamn lies is over niggas)
Same niggas laugh when you making shit
Then three years later wanna emulate the shit you did
Y'all pay the price
Ask some old friends, that shit is over and finished
Look around in the crowd, them niggas not even attendance
That shit is done, and Lionel my witness
But I had to move on cause I can't fuck with them niggas
I shut it down
Now wow, now he's saying that one day
He found his wings, now he using 'em on his runway
Pink yellow, blue and orange, shit is dark
Different pattern, you say the same shit from the start
Niggas I am a wave, y'all just fuck with the sharks
And I got flames on my pants cause I walk how I talk
So keep them comments, keep them comments, keep them comments, boy
When it's said and done my pockets gon' be filled with commas, boy
Y'all say that's chance, y'all saying this
Y'all niggas say that shit is gross, that shit is nasty, eww get away boy, I'm good

And if you see my old friends, tell 'em that I really miss 'em but I'm good
And if you see some bad times, tell 'em I don't really miss 'em, boy I'm good
And if you see my old self, tell him not to worry cause he'll be good
Sorry my feelings is running, GOLF 2016, thank you niggas for coming
I'm out, I'm out

// Odd & Twisted //

[Tyler:]
Hey guys (Golf Wang!)
I'm Peter Rosenberg, super-underground
You know me, uh, you see my laptop, yeah, I mean
Apple is pretty mainstream but I have underground stickers
So it levels out

[Domo:]
Y'all niggas got it twisted, we ain't the Misfits
We the sick shit, make the competition slit wrists
Bodybag, beats get rapped like it's Christmas
Popping tags, I stay in Dior cause I'm Christian
Nigga listen: I been killing shit since I was the
Age of the face that R. Kelly pissed in
In the booth, I'm brawling to be like the Pistons
Only smoke flight, you can't hit if you ain't pitched in!
And bitch stop talking, let the marijuana sink in
And when that chauffeur roll up, you better get in
You and your 6 friends, even your big friend
Got a gang of wolves that slay hoes like henchmen
O.F. kill someone, yeah nigga we shipped it
Local ass nigga, we overseas on you dipshits
Walking flex tweet, motherfucker take a Twitpic
Kidnapped the game and it won't quit bitching

[Tyler:]
Duct tape, bow knife, now I'm breaking in homes
And now I'm in the closet with Kelly, we're watching The Throne
And 'till I get that mothafucka I'll be watching ya home
And gonna tryna go harder than me hiding a boner
With lights on it, see I was the loner
Now I got a bunch of fucking Lindsay Lohans
That don't even know me, tryna get me that old hand
Job, fuck that ho blow me
The G.I. Joe of O.F. is slowly
Solely running shit his toes is swollen
Goblin left the bridge, no more patrolling
Stick my finger in any hole I can find, fuck bowling
I'm making that bread, jabronni, and the green shit that's growing is stuck
My Bank account is molding
Me and Wanda Sykes was holding hands 'till I eat her cooter
Like a fresh bowl of Ravioli, Chef Boyar-T
On tour, had to make a couple pit stops
Ended at this fucking hipster club called the Pin Drop
Where they said they hated on me and Odd Future kids
And how much they really love underground hip-hop
We don't give a fuck like a virginized dick cock
After being tickled by a couple Eddie Bishops
Young niggas OF, got this
Come to my show and see niggers in the moshpit
Cat on my cotton, zebra print 5 panel from Jebbia
Now I'm flyer than an ostrich
VMA nom, yes! Video my set
Harder than Nakel not nolling a nine set
Thrasher, billboard, cover of them issues
Boy flow colder than O'Shay stuck in an igloo
I'mma fuck the game till my herpes-covered dick's bruised

// OKRA //

Man, now they go (ayo)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Did this shit in one take, ayo)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Ayo, that's that fire shit, nigga, ayo)
Fuck these niggas man, man, man, man (Run it, run it)

Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure

Say
Uno the shoe, red with the blue
Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 (Hey!)
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you, haha

Man, now they go
(I ain't fuckin' with none of these niggas, man)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Yeah, give these niggas information nigga)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Now we never fuckin' stop)
Fuck these (Ayo) niggas man, that's for sure (Ayo)

Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver (Skrrt!)
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you're a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark (Sike)
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends

// Peach Fuzz //

It's 9:23 AM
And uh... an idea
Summer fling idea

You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)

Yeah, mama, yeah, mama, I'm daddy, no, I'm not
You're a lot of fucking problems, you gon' prolly show true colors
By the time we tie the knot up, Tyler, Tyler, he got caught up
Now they taking my ricotta, bunch of lawyers and 'your honors'
I mean, no mama, more father but my fanbase that's from Goblin
Don't believe me, I been saying since '13 but they blinded
But whatever, I'm reminded that I slightly got off topic of this song, shit
Shout out Prophet, okay
Could you tell me how far in the future do you see us?
You can make decisions while your lips graze on my peach fuzz
Pull out the guitar and learn some new chords from Anita Baker
Baker got some acres out the window when you wake up
I'm a fish sign, my b-day March and put it's knee up
Bunch of yes sergeants 'til we barge in on them tea cups
But guarantee that I will get my stripes just like Adidas
Nah, we don't wear those, it's UNOs when we put feet up, yeah

You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
You said keep it short, this is peach fuzz
Contact, couple months, then we out
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)
It's nothing serious (I wanna be your man)

Yo, shout out Stones Throw man

Album's beautiful
Summer flings and shit
It's nothing serious, just, you know

// Potato Salad //

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Yo, now you gon' start me from the top? Listen
Shout out Harlem, man
Shout out A$AP Rocky, man

AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen

Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs

I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses

Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris

[A$AP Rocky:]
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers

In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze

But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food

That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel

Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?

I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge

I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed

But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahaha, yeah!

K shiz, what up, nigga!

// Rose Tinted Cheeks //

Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
Beep

I never had the courage to tell you I adore you
I did it in a song, I was too afraid to call you
I know, I know, I'm sorry, I know I'm annoyin'
I just want your attention
Ever since I saw you, knew nothin' was important
Your gravity is too strong and it's fuckin' up my orbit
Contact avoided by the time I record this
I just want you to listen

Every time I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay
No, I won't

'Cause it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)

They Black Flag we AF
We BF as AF
But they won't get that
That's that 20 Century Women reference
You so hard to get like intricate metaphors
Companies? I own four
But all I want is yours
Hit the 'plex and catch a band (ooh)
Sushi spot I recommend (ooh)
Float around hittin' wheelies, leg or engine-based, it all depends
Either one is cool to me
And you're way too cool for me
I'm 'a freeze to death tryna keep up
Thirsty I am, I may need three cups, what's up?

Every time I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay

It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks, uh

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact, yeah
Speedin' down the 5 in my newest ride
You was kinda high, speakers mild high
Track 10 track 10, dirt bike afternoons
As long as pale skin's near, I didn't have to leave the room
Switch gears
Roamed around fell in love (fell in love)
Broke my leg, got stuck, what the fuck?
Hit my head, wait, I wish you would fall in too, I said
I wish you would fall in and snap them legs
'Cause I'm 'a be stuck here until I'm dead and gone

La-la-la, la-la-la, uh
La-la-la, la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

I remember when we first met
My eyes, like jeans too tight, I couldn't take 'em off you
You're precious metal I was a magnet just lookin'
I've been searching for somethin'
But didn't know what I was looking for
Then you popped and it became so clear
Like that water up north, so clear
Got me sayin'
Alright, alright
And truthfully now
I'm intimidated by your existence
Flustered because of your presence and
Your absence leaves me, leaves me in a state of confusion... I mean... (uh huh, alright)
I really can't function (ah)
La-la-la-la (uh-huh)
I can't explain it (uh-huh)
I'm aware enough to know this is just a temporary pool of emotion, shit (uh-huh, alright)
But since I'm here, I might as well drown, so
Please don't save me (uh-huh)
Ha ha ha, woo!
Yeah, alright (uh huh, alright)

// Rotten Sarah //

Cold blood
Green eyes with mute body filled with old drugs
Dead body laying next to Sarah, finally together
Truthfully, I kinda like this a little better
Now we floating our spirits the dead, you can hear it
You call her stands up when you're near it
You can feel it on your mark, see it in the dark
Homicidal, I never had a fucking heart
And she tried tear us apart
She beg me to stop and I didn't even start (Sarah)

And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
In this book of love, seen the look of her face
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
And Sarah stays rotten in my base
In the book of love, you should have seen the look on her face
And Sarah stays rotten in my base

You tryna run, but I found blue
Yellows over there
And the motherfucking field where
The niggas wear colored pants, jerking, pop pills
I'm on the other side
Where all the niggas ride, the niggas skate
But we take indy bitches with high GPAs up on a date
Where niggas smoke blunts and sniff coke
Where the motherfucking freestyles are never wrote
Or written, I'm livin'
Nigga shittin' while I'm pissin'
On they face, mace
Here you call the cops
Here's my phone, I'll catch your case
But I got a good lawyer so my fucking record erase
Just like a fucking pencil, I mental
Left Brain laced this instrumental, with some shit that's so illegal, that
He gon' have to go and fly over seas like an eagle
In the Winter, December, Imba, Limpa
Kick him in the leg now he limpa, IMPA
Niggas rolling 'round, Nipsey Hussle in the Impala
Looking at me while I style on ya
Oh, you mad 'cause I'm styling on you?

Plus the call is on me?
4-5in on 'em
Gnolly tricks on ya bitch, girl-boy looking clean 'cause
You already know my hat green, and that shit staying Supreme
Uh
You can't fuck with it, you little H-B
You hate me, A-C, L-B, H-B
C-V, Super 3 and Bran'doom DeShay
With my Nigga Domo the Gene'says, you
Hate on the O-F, that's the best letter in the world
And I'm better better, than your better girl
She the best I've ever had. I--
Asthma fuck it, I'm coughing
This the re'free- oh shit
I'm 'bout to hit it back
I said, this the re-freestyle
No written
I spit all my shit from the dome
Home like a motherfucker nigga leaving his college, for good
In the Hood
I'm from Ladera, not from Anglewood
Hawthorne couple times, go the city where I be
Even up in Hollywood, you could find me
I'm not a fucking cliche
E-Shay, E, A, oh fuck it I'm over it
I got work tomorrow
Left Brain let me get a beat to borrow
Just so I could spit the shit quick
Bitches with some big lips, yeah she got some big lips
A nice small tongue, for this over-sized big dick
Size 12 in the shoe, 32 in the jeans
Skinny as fuck motherfucking T-shirt a 2X, yes
And you could ask anybody here that's daily
Bitches feel me, fucking iPods wanna play me
Ask me why I cuss so much
Fuck, shit, cunt and dick
Now shut the fuck up bitch
Eat a fucking dick in a blanket
I be on that stank shit
Fuck everybody here
What the fuck I look like thankin'?
Oh shit, the beat ended, fuck

Focus on the Eve, nah focus on the green
In the trees with binoculars, looking for an Adam

That's 400 for my exhaust, the mean with the walk
Now tell the Black Youth, to just be
Tell 'em never stop
Yeah we all moving, but you ain't gotta put us in a box
We can paint, we can draw, whatever
We can Lady Bird, we can Baby Boy
Whatever movie setting you choose

// You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch //

You're a mean one
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
(Mr. Grinch), with the greasy black peel
You're a vile one
You got termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile (Mr. Grinch)
You're a foul one
Friends you don't have none
I wouldn't touch you with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!
You're a monster
Your heart's an empty hole
You got garlic (You got garlic) in your soul
You got garlic in your soul

All them smiles homie
I turn 'em to frowns
All them decorations
I tear 'em down
You can ask Max, I don't play around
Ayo (Ew...)
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow? (Ew...)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door, mane

Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
You're gonna spoil everybody with your bad attitude
(Spoil everybody)
Mr. Grinch
La-la-la
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow?
(La-la-la-la)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door!
(La-la)
Bad banana

// Ziploc //

Try to do this bitch in one take, or somethin'

What's the point of bein' rich when you wake up alone?
What's the point of goin' home when it ain't nobody there?
Fuck that, I grab my bike and phone home in the air
And I pedal through the city with the wide frame steer
With that tall pale boy that I met last year
Grape, that's what I call him, love, that's what I fall in
Fell in, I ain't like sports growing up, but now I'm ballin'
I guess I'm a late bloomer
Ayo, look, high tide bottoms 'cause the neck on lunar
Them GOLF le FLEUR unos 'cause, we don't do Puma, nah
20k pairs, gone in 3 seconds
You ain't gotta like him and you ain't gotta respect him
For playin' chess with these niggas
That think that they're bench-pressin'
Leg day is getting skipped, guess who really runnin' shit?
Young Teezy, it ain't easy, feelin' wheezy in this bitch
New slaves got y'all niggas feelin' breezy on the ship
Pour a Fanta in your poison so it's easier to sip, huh?
My shit leaked two weeks before that release date
First week, did dos, a thousand off, beat Meek
Shout out Meek! Two niggas first week top 3!
And I can't even get a song to play on the radio
But tripled in them ratings, TV channels still pay me tho, ha ha
P told me not to trip
I am in my Ziploc, nigga
Feel like I got the best album out, uh
I know I got the best album out, preach

Let me, let me hear that
