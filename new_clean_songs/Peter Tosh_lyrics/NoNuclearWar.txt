// Nah Goa Jail //

[Chorus:]
Nah Goa Jail
Said me Nah Goa Jail
Fe ganja no more
I'm a Nah Goa Jail

This here smoke
That you see me with sir
I just got it from an officer
And this here little bit of green sensimilla
I just got it from an inspector
He's my friend

[Chorus]

When you see me
Walking down the street
It is time that you respect to me
'Cause from I ever know myself
I don't know why you always harass me

[Chorus]

I hear one leader say
If it wasn't for the little sensi
Him no know what happen to the economy

I see another leader
Go in a Half Way Tree
And he set them ganja prisoners free

[Chorus]

This here spliff that you see me with sir
I just got it from a priest sir
And this little bit of brown sensimilla
I just got it from a minister
My my my friend

[Chorus]

I been there too many times...
Too many work to do...

From colonial powers
Taking my diamonds
Filling ballistic missiles

[Chorus]

// Vampire //

Unnu old vampire
You don't like to see youths prosper
Only like to see youths suffer
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu old vampire
Only trod upon creation
With your bloody meditation
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu fight against upfullness
Unnu fight against creation
Unnu fight against
Everything good for the younger generation

Unnu old vampire
Do unnu wickedness at midnight
And unnu humble when it's daylight
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu old vampire
Only like to see blood running
But true you know it's fire bunnin'
Unnu set of vampire

Now unnu fight against upfullness
Fight against creation
Fight against everything good for the younger generation

Unnu old vampire
Only trod upon creation
Sucking the blood of the nation
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu old vampire
Unnu drink up the old wine
Have no place for the new mind
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu fight against morality
You fight against integrity
Fight against everything good for the younger generation

Unnu old vampire
Only trod upon creation
With your bloody meditation
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu old vampire
Do unnu wickedness at midnight
And unnu humble when it's daylight
Unnu set of vampire

Unnu old vampires

Unnu grieve their brnk? Lord

Unnu fire burial

Unnu hypocrite the world, God

Unnu old vampire
Do unnu wickedness every night
And unnu humble when daylight
Unnu old...

// In My Song //

In my song Jah is the melody
In my song he is the symphony
In my song he is the sweet inspiration
In my song it's the perfect meditation

When I'm feeling down
Got nowhere to go
I get into myself
And I put on a show

In my song Jah is the melody
In my song he is everything to me
In my song he is the musical beat
In my song he is the rhythm and tempo

And when you're feeling out
Don't sit down and cry
Don't forget
That the music is passing by

In my song Jah is the melody
In my song he is everything to me
In my song he is the sweet inspiration
In my song there is no complication

'Cause in times like these
When people don't know what to do
And getting so frustrated
Get into yourself and sing

In my song Jah is the melody
In my song he is the symphony
In my song he is the rhythm
In my song he's everything to me

In my song
In my song no complication
In my song Jah is the melody
In my song he is the sweet inspiration

In my song he is the symphony
In my song he makes it feel so good
In my song is a blessing to my soul
In my song can't go outta control

In my song it is a medicine to me
In my song relieve my frustration

// Testify //

[Chorus:]
I said I
I'm gonna testify
What Jah has done for I

When I'm down he picks me up
When I'm empty he fills my cup
When obstacles are in my way
He remove them for me I say

[Chorus]

When my friends try to fight me down
Jah says I'm still around
When they dig pits in my way
He remove them for me I say

[Chorus]

Satan is working every day
Trying to lead you all astray
Be careful of who you obey
Or you'll be going in Satan's way

[Chorus]

While I'm walking through this land
He make me to be a better man
He taught me how to overstand
And he always he lead me by my hand

[Chorus]

Every day
Every time
I've got to testify
What Jah has done for I

// Come Together //

[Chorus:]
You better come together
Learn to love one another
We got to come together
Learn to love one another

We got to come together
Learn to love your brother
We got to come together
Learn to love your sister

One eye can't see
One ear don't hear
One hand can't clap
One foot don't run

Where do we go from here
Here, there or nowhere
I said where do we go from here
Here, there or nowhere

[Chorus]

Birds unite
Fishes unite
Animals unite
Mankind still fight

[Chorus]
