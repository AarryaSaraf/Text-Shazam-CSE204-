// Pick Myself Up //

Sittin' in the morning sun
And watching all the birds passing by
Oh how sweet they sing
And oh how much I wish that I could fly

And I try
I said I try
I try
I really try try try

But I got to
Pick myself up
Dust myself off
Start all over, again (Chorus 2x)

Sittin' in the midday sun
And wondering where my meal's coming from
After working so hard
Not even piece of bread at the yard

And I said I try
Oh Lord I try
I try
I really try try try

Sittin' in the evening sun
And watching the same birds passing by
Sittin' and wondering
And waiting for the time for me to fly

And I try
I said I try
Good Lord I try
I really try try try

So long and I just find
It was just a waste of time
So long and I just find
I been been wasting all my time

I've got to pick myself up...

// Soon Come //

Every time I call
You tell me that you soon come
I call you on the phone
You tell me that you soon come

I don't like hangin' around
Or to be pushed around
I got my business puttin' down
I don't like soon come

I checked you at the gate
You tell me that you soon come
Make a date you're late
I wait because you soon come

Tell I what you're waiting for
Is it bus, truck or car
I-Man don't like your war
I don't like soon come

I checked you uptown
You tell me that you soon come
I checked you downtown
You tell me that you soon come

Don't take I for a fool
Who just come at of school
Don't ride me like a mule
I don't like soon come

I saw you on the bus
You tell I that you soon come
You start to make a fuss
You tell I that you soon come

You coulda screwed 'til you blue
I got to be with you
No matter what you do
I don't like soon come

You coulda screwed 'til you blue
No matter what you do
The chances are with you
I don't like soon come

Put some smile on your face
Let money be the taste
Like your presence in this place
I don't like soon come

// Dem Ha Fe Get A Beatin //

Due to unfavorable financial condition
I am unable to cope with this financial situation
That is causing inflation upon creation

I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause the battle is getting hotter

[Chorus:]
But them ha fe get a beatin'
The wicked ha fe get a beatin'
Them must get a beatin'
The wicked ha fe get a beatin'

Now that you waited
'Til you back is against the wall
One step to progess my brother
And I know Jah will help you all

[Chorus]

I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause even cockroach get nuffer

[Chorus]

Tell me how long
Must the good suffer for the bad
And every time the good open his mouth
The bad say "You must be mad!"

[Chorus]

I can't stand this no longer

Now that you waited so long
'Til you back is against the wall
If you make one step to progress
I know Jah will help you all

[Chorus]

I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get so strong
I can't stand this no longer
Everything seem to be wrong

[Chorus]
