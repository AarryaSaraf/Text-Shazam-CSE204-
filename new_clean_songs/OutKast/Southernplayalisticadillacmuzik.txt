[Big Boi:]
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

[André 3000:]
Time is slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

// Ain't No Thang //

[André 3000:]
Niggas in the point ain't changed
Niggas in the point ain't changed
Yeah

A nigga ready from the get-go (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo' punk ass come out to play?
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off
Dead is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away
This ain't gon' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up, nigga, if you want some

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Big Boi:]
Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[André 3000:]
3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me
Off my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep?
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just to let you know, yeah

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Big Boi:]
It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
You 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah, that's how I do
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

Yeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop

// Welcome To Atlanta (Interlude) //

Hi-errr, this is the Captain ... speaking
We are now descending into Hartsfield International Airport
I'd like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta
Which, by the way, is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons
To the far left, you can see the Georgia Dome
Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South
And is the home of LaFace Records
Organized Noize Productions

If you look to your far right, you can see Decatur
And below you, to the right, is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs, rap cats, and robbin' crew
And home to the player, the 'Lacs, and the motherfuckin' Outkast

// Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik //

[Big Boi:]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

[Andre 3000:]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell "ho," and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Big Boi:]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Andre 3000:]
Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

// Call Of Da Wild //

[André 3000:]
I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson 'cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on their ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of their asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas trying to serve us
To graduate is really becoming a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly trying to dig up in me
He said I'm half-assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is getting smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

[Cee-Lo Green:]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[T-Mo:]
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words 'cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with OutKast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

[Cee-Lo Green:]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[Big Boi:]
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office 'cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

[Cee-Lo Green:]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[Khujo:]
Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's getting horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild
I let out a call to da wild

// Player's Ball (Original Version) //

[Rico Wade:]
Man let me hit that
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[André 3000:]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

[Sleepy Brown:]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Big Boi:]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

[Sleepy Brown:]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Big Boi:]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

[André 3000:]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

[Sleepy Brown:]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Peaches:]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

[Sleepy Brown:]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

// Claimin' True //

[Big Boi:]
Well it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[André 3000:]
Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

[Big Boi:]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Rico Wade:]
What y'all fuck niggas know about that?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, P.A
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Kawan "K-Axe" Prather:]
Yeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know
Ain't shit changed, just a couple of more names
Yeah, that's right
Organized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube
CeeLo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the muthafuckin' OutKast
That's right, nigga, we taking that bullshit no mo' in '94
Shit

[Big Boi and Rico Wade:]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
(Peace to the Godfather ass, gangsta ass niggas, Antonio Reid)
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
Unleash your sexual fantasies
It would be so nice
Ahh, relax your body next to me
As I sing this OutKast melody
On this funky ride
So just relax baby

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

Now baby, now the smoke is in the air
Martell and Coke has got me there
And we wonder why you're high?
Well baby umm, it's nothing but that
Sess in your chest that got you feeling kinda crazy
So let your spirits fly
Uhh and enjoy the ride
Oh yeah baby

Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

// Git Up, Git Out //

[Cee-Lo:]
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Big Boi:]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!

[Cee-Lo:]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Big Gipp:]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead, 'cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Cee-Lo:]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[André 3000:]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

[Cee-Lo:]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

You need to
You need to
You need to
You need to

// True Dat (Interlude) //

[Big Rube:]
Operating under the crooked American system too long
OutKast, pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society
But let's look deeper than that
Are you an OutKast?
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are
If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast? I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else
It's only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize what's going on around you
Poisoning of the food and water
Tampering of cigarettes
Disease engineering control over your life
Take back your existence or die like a punk
This is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real, and death to the fakers
Peace out

// Crumblin' Erb //

[André 3000:]
Yessuh, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling thangs, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still André got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you gots
Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
You's gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, wassup?

[Sleepy Brown:]
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

[Big Boi:]
So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them thangs, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to dat
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

Wooo! Big Boi
Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping
It's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day e'ery day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

[André 3000:]
We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that, see, nigga, you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting, I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but King Shit, I am asking, sucka, can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle, motherfucker, don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace, yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

[Big Boi:]
Ah, shit now
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I, just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping, never slipping, that's how it is
That how it's gon' be, that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures, nigga
It's all day everyday, so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on, know what I'm saying? Yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

// Hootie Hoo //

[Big Boi:]
Hootie Hoo, follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on, like that
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah suki, suki, all day, e'rr day, any day, every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a crumb of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

[André 3000:]
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light? (Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's "Player's Ball 2," so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did
Nah, it couldn't be me, not me

Hootie Hoo,Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

[Big Boi:]
Well you know we getting blizzard
Cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope
But some of you niggas can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So God Almighty know, it's Outkast for the '94 era
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to hell

[André 3000:]
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
It's that Southern sess in your chest that is
One mo' 'gain for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some vocals, you can quote those
Head, till I'm dead, yes it's down yo throat holes
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit
But if you fall in this category, then you's a bitch
Hootie Hoo

Hootie Hoo, Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on their way

I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill their own folks, what you think they're gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your motherfucking spine
No, I make that three 'cause I don't wanna hear you whine

Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it

And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid 'cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted 'cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordans came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup
Please don't let them Dixie motherfuckers put that flag up
But let me shut up 'cause they say we're equal

Niggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, motherfucker 'cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if you's in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws 'cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah

And if your hoe is acting crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

[Sleepy Brown:]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day everyday
