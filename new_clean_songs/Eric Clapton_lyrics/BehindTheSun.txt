// See What Love Can Do //

When your world, it starts to fall apart
Look deep within, within your lonely heart
Do your best my friend, try and understand
It's only you, pull yourself through

When you tell your story
Make sure your story's right
Every little single word is true
See what love can do
See what love can do

When the words are in the music, the music is the song
The world would be so happy, if we'd all just get along
I want to see it, a smile on every face

So when we tell our story
Make sure that it's right
And every single word is true
See what love can do
See what love can do

So when you tell your story, honey
Make sure that it's right
I finally proved the message true
I see what love can do
See what love can do

See what love can do
See what love can do

When we sing the story
Make sure your song is right
Finally proved the message true
See what love can do
Oh, see what love can do

See what love can do
See what love can do
See what love can do
See what love can do

// Same Old Blues //

I'm sorry baby, but I can't afford to stay
Your good, kind treatment will worry me someday
I love you baby, but I'm gonna have to say goodbye
Woman, I got to move, I really got to fly

Same thing every morning
Tell me what's it all about
I get those same old blues every night

I miss you already, baby, more than words can say
Seems like I've been gone twenty-four hours, more like a million days
I love you baby, you know I wouldn't tell you no lies
If you don't believe I love you, look at the tears standing in my eyes

Same thing every morning
Tell me what's it all about
I get those same old blues every night

Here I am back home, baby, I'm back home to stay
I love you babe, never more will I go away
I won't hurt you no more, baby, ain't gonna tell you no more lies
No more running 'round, no more phony alibi

Same thing every morning
Tell me what's it all about
I get those same old blues every night

Same thing every morning
Tell me what's it all about
I get those same old blues every night

Same thing every morning
Tell me what's it all about
I get those same old blues every night

// Knock On Wood //

I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got
If I do, I would surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby

I'm not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance
You got me spinning, baby, baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby

There's no secret that woman is my loving cup
She sees to it that I get it up
Just one touch from her, you know can do so much

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby

Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood

// Something's Happening //

Something's happening, something's going on
Something's happening, something so strong
Something's happening, something all over the world

Spirit's moving and it is moving fast
You better get aboard and don't be last
Something's happening, something all over the world

My life has been a series of endless changes
A constant struggle to be free
One thing I know for sure now, baby
It's me for you and you for me

Something's happening, something's going on
Something's happening, something so strong
Something's happening, something all over the world

Spirit's moving and it is moving fast
You better get aboard and don't be last
Something's happening, something all over the world

Something's happening, something's going on
Something's happening, something so strong
Something's happening, something all over the world

// Forever Man //

How many times must I tell you babe
How many bridges I have got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss?
Before I can talk to the boss?

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man

// It All Depends //

So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could it be, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know

Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends
I can tell they really think you're fine
And I've seen you with your other men friends
They don't know if you're a love of mine

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

'Cause you've taken away
The only thing I ever had
Don't you know that I love you?
Why'd you make me feel bad?
'Cause the only thing I ever loved
Was loving you

So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could it be, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

So you think you are something special?
What makes you think you are something special?

// Tangled In Love //

A modern man with an old-fashioned heart
One look at her and I fell apart
I was always the one playing it cool
I got caught in the act, now there's no turning back

I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love

A long black dress and the call of the wild
I was a fool to think she was just a child
Out of my mind, out of control
Knew that feeling too well, tried to run but I fell

I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love

I never meant to feel this way
Now I always want to stay

I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love

I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love
I got tangled in love, tangled in love

// Never Make You Cry //

It's so easy loving you
With everything I feel inside
And holding me the way you do
It's here I'm staying all of my life

I'll never ever make you cry
I'll never ever say goodbye
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm yours until the day I die

I'll watch you fall asleep at night
I'll smile and kiss you, hold you tight
I'll hold your hand and close my eyes
It's here I'm staying all of my life

I'll never ever make you cry
I'll never ever say goodbye
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm yours until the day I die

I'll never ever make you cry
I'll never ever say goodbye
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm yours until the day I die

// Just Like A Prisoner //

Just like a prisoner
He don't know right from wrong
Just like a baby
He sings a pleading song

And that's why
So many tears must fall
Yes, that's why
So many tears must fall

Just like a sailor
He steers away from home
He feels a tidal wave
In his heart, but he ain't alone

And that's why
So many tears must fall
Yes, that's why
So many tears must fall

I'm like that prisoner
I don't know right from wrong
Just like that baby
I sing a pleading song

And that's why
You'll never know how I feel
Yes, that's why
You'll never know how I feel

// Behind The Sun //

My love has gone behind the sun
Since she left, the darkness has begun
The smile that used to shine on me
Is nothing more than a memory

I see her face, I hear her voice
She made a move, I had no choice
But walk and cry, wipe tears with my hand
The one that carries a wedding band

And the clouds hang low
And the flowers that used to grow in my heart
Are dying now
Dying now
Dying now
