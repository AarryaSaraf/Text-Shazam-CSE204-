// Alberta //

Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
Hahahahaha

Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been gone

Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Come home this morning
Clothes don't fit you right

Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
I've had no loving
Such a great long time

Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been gone

// Layla //

What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know, it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

// Running On Faith //

Lately, I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you

Lately, I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way

I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who'd care just for me

And we go running on faith
All of our dreams will come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who cares just for me

Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

When love comes over you
Said when love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
I said when love comes over you
All of our dreams will
All of our dreams will come true
When love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you

// Old Love //

I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

// Before You Accuse Me //

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
Taking money from someone else

I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mama said, "Son, don't call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
You know I don't know how to quit you, I'm gonna lose my mind

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You're taking money from someone else

// Hey Hey //

Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
I love you baby
Sure ain't gonna be your dog

Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
My arms around you baby
All I can say is hey

Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey
I love you baby
Sure ain't gonna be your dog

Hey hey. You lost your good thing now
Hey hey. You lost your good thing now
You had me fooled
I found it out somehow

// Tears In Heaven //

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please

Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

// Lonely Stranger //

I must be invisible
No one knows me
I have crawled down dead-end streets
On my hands and knees

I was born with a raging thirst
A hunger to be free
But I've learned through the years
Don't encourage me

Because I'm a lonely stranger here
Well, beyond my day
And I don't know what's going on
I'll be on my way

Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)

When I walk, stay behind
Don't get close to me
Because it's sure to end in tears
So just let me be

Some will say that I'm no good
Maybe I agree
Take a look then walk away
That's all right with me

Because I'm a lonely stranger here
Well, beyond my day
And I don't know what's going on
I'll be on my way

Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)

Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)

Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)
Yes, I will
Yes, I will
(I'll be on my way)

// Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out //

Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, I just did not care
Took all my friends out for a good time
Bought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm going to hang on to it until that eagle grins

Because no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

// Walkin' Blues //

Woke up this morning, feel 'round for my shoes
You know 'bout that babe, had them old walkin' blues
Woke up this morning, I feel 'round for my shoes
You know 'bout that babe, Lord, I had them old walkin' blues

Leavin' this morning, I had to go ride the blinds
I've been mistreated, don't mind dying
This morning, I had to go ride the blinds
I've been mistreated, Lord, I don't mind dying

People tell me walkin' blues ain't bad
Worst old feeling I most ever had
People tell me the old walkin' blues ain't bad
Well it's the worst old feeling, Lord, I most ever had

// San Francisco Bay Blues //

I got the blues from my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad, she was the best girl I ever have had
She said goodbye, I can take a cry, I want to lay down and die

I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime
She don't come back, think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

Sitting down looking from my back door, wondering which way to go
The woman I'm so crazy about, she don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train, 'cause I'm feeling blue
And ride all the way to the end of the line, thinking only of you

Meanwhile, in another city, just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, the way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

// Malted Milk //

I keep drinking malted milk
Trying to drive my blues away
I keep drinking malted milk
Trying to drive my blues away
Baby, you're just as welcome to my loving
As the flowers is in May

Malted milk, malted milk
Keep rushing to my head
Malted milk, malted milk
Keep rushing to my head
And I have a funny, funny feeling
And I'm talking all out my head

Baby, fix me one more drink
And hug your daddy one more time
Baby, fix me one more drink
And hug your daddy one more time
Keep on stirring my malted milk, mama
Until I change my mind

My doorknob keeps on turning
There must be spooks around my bed
My doorknob keeps on turning
There must be spooks around my bed
And I have a funny, funny feeling
And the hair's rising on my head

// Rollin' And Tumblin' //

Well, I woke up this morning, my biscuit rolling on

Well now, come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee
Well now, come here baby, sit down on daddy's knee
I want to tell you about the way they treated me

Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long
Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long
When I woke up this morning, all I had was gone
