// Bad Boy //

I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
But I've got nobody
To bury me when I'm dead and gone

Well I'm the cat that scratches
And I'm like a dog that bites
I'll be your box of matches, baby
When you need a light

I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
But I've got nobody
To bury me when I'm dead and gone

I used to have a little girl
Only 16 years old
But her mom and dad put me way out
Way out in the cold

I can't stay here no longer
My luck is running slow
Got to keep on moving
But I've got no place to go

I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
I'm just a bad boy
Long long ways from home
But I've got nobody
To bury me when I'm dead and gone

// Lonesome And A Long Way From Home //

Out on an open highway
Such a lovely day but something's wrong
Something, something's got to be wrong, oh oh
(Something surely wrong)

I just left home this morning
This old road keeps rolling on and on
Rolling, rolling on and on
(Rolling, rolling on and on)

Won't somebody help me?
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)

I've never been so lonesome and a long way from home
(Never been so lonesome)
Never been lonesome an' a long way
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonesome)
I've never been lonesome an' a long way from home
(Never been so lonely)
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonely)

Yeah, something's wrong
Something, something's surely wrong
Rolling on and on
Rolling, rolling on and on

Won't somebody help me?
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)

I've never been so lonesome and a long way from home
(Never been so lonesome)
Never been lonesome an' a long way
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonesome)
I've never been lonesome an' a long way from home
(Never been so lonely)
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonely)

(Never never never)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely
(I've never been so lonely)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely

(Never never never)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely
(I've never been so lonely)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely

(Never never never)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely
(I've never been so lonely)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely

// Easy Now //

Holding you, you holding me
Everyone could see we were in ecstasy
Making love against the wall
Feeling very small when we didn't need to be

Easy now; don't let my love flow out of you
Please remember that I want you to come too

Oh my darling, help me please
When I'm without you I fall down and graze my knees
I look so funny and I feel sad
Your love is all I've ever had, so please don't tease

Easy now; don't let my love flow out of you
Please remember that I want you to come too

Yesterday, you know tomorrow
Could it be I'll have to borrow someone new?
I know that I'm the one to blame
But all the same, there must be something you can do

Easy now; don't let my love flow out of you
Please remember that I want you to come too

Easy now; don't let my love flow out of you
Please remember that I want you to come too

Easy now; don't let my love flow out of you
Please remember that I want you to come too

// Bottle Of Red Wine //

Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine

Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
You hear what I say?
Gonna love you anyway
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine

I went to an all-night get together
And everyone I knew was there
Had the love that would last forever
Everywhere I looked, I saw you standing there

Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head
I said get up right now, oh oh
I said get up right now
Feel so bad this morning; got a terrible headache in my head
Do me a favor, baby, do me a favor please
Please get up; get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up, get up; get your man a big big bottle of red wine

// Lovin' You Lovin' Me //

I am so in love for once in my life
In my dreams, I've known you many times before
And I so want you to be my dear wife
As only you can satisfy me any more
And only you can love me more

I'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you
It's all the same; when loving, two together makes one
Everybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la
It's all the same, and we are one

I will give you a world of your dreams if you want them
I can feel the power when you're standing there
Someone sent me you; oh lord, I will thank him
And all the rest, it just don't matter
And all the rest and all the rest

I'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you
It's all the same; when loving, two together makes one
Everybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la
It's all the same, and we are one

Loving you
You know I love you

// Told You For The Last Time //

Well, I've told you for the last time
Told you for the last time
I'm gonna turn on my love light
Let it shine one more time
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time

There's gonna be a big change made, and I'm gonna make it
This time I'm gonna lay it on the line
I got a lot to give when you're woman enough to take it, oh yeah

I'm gonna turn on my love light
Let it shine one more time
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time

I sure want to love you baby, baby if you'd only let me
You only pick me up just to put me down
I finally let my mind make a decision, oh yeah

I'm gonna start my wheels a-spinnin'
Let 'em turn one more time
Let 'em turn, oh yeah, for the last time

Well, I've told you for the last time
Told you for the last time
I'm gonna turn on my love light
Let it shine one more time
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time

// Don't Know Why //

You say you want everything good for me
But I know so well, I can tell when you're lying
Making believe you're looking up to me
And I'm just sitting here, crying

And I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why I don't care

You'll go on back to him, he'll take you in
I know he's gonna love you, but I still want you back again
'Cause baby you're part of me, it's deep inside of you
When he's done all he can, you'll come running to your other man, oh yeah

And I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why I don't care

I know you won't soon forget last night
Your precious love was all over me, but it's all right
Go on and try again but you know nothing's gonna change
That's the way it's gonna be, oh yeah

And I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why I don't care
