Album: RidingWithTheKing

// Key To The Highway //

I got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is most too slow

I'm going back to the border
Woman, where I'm better known
You know you haven't done nothing
Drove a good man away from home

[Live-version verse:]
When the moon peeks over the mountains
I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roam this old highway
Until the break of day

Oh give me one, one more kiss mama
Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time you know I
I won't be back no more

I got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is most too slow

I'm going back to the border
Woman, where I'm better known
You know you haven't done nothing
Drove a good man away from home

// Riding With The King //

I dreamed I had a good job and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a Kewpie doll
No pretty chick is going to make me crawl

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know you're riding with the king?

He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
He's going to check us all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled

Get on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody, everybody clap your hands
And don't you doubt, love, the way that he sings
Don't you know you're riding with the king?
Riding with the king
Don't you know you're riding with the king?

A tuxedo and a shiny 335
You can see it in his face, the blues never lie
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
And don't you know we're riding with the king?

I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm going to play this thing until the day I die

Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Riding, you're riding with the king
You're riding, you're riding with the king

// Ten Long Years //

Well, I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh, I had a woman
She was kind and loving to me in every way
Oh, she used to love me
And bring my breakfast to the bed every day

Oh, for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Oh, for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
I used to call her my little girl
Oh, she used to call me, she used to call me her little boy

Oh, it's all over, baby
You know I'm all alone
It's all over, baby
Babe, you know I'm all alone
Well, the reason you hear me singing the blues, baby
Yeah, you know my baby's gone, she's gone, she's gone
