// Atomic Dog //

Yeah, this is a story of a famous dog
For the dog that chases its tail will be dizzy
These are clapping dogs, rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs, house dogs, street dogs
Dog of the world unite - dancin' dogs
Yeah, countin' dogs, funky dogs
Nasty dogs (Dog)
Atomic dog
Atomic dog

Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah

(Life on all fours)
Un-tied dog in a telematic society
(When you're out there walking the streets)
Ain't your average huckleberry hound
(May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Darn the dog in me

Life on all fours
When you're out there walking the streets
May compete
Nothin' but the dog in ya
Roof
Roof
Roof

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
(Dog, dog, dog)
Do the dogcatcher
Baby, do the dogcatcher, oh

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Just walkin' the dog!
Oh, atomic dog

Futuristic bow-wow
Leader of the pack
Wild dog

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Dog in me, dog is in me
Talking dogs, dog's in me

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do you wanna do the dogcatcher?
Well, baby, why don't you do it again for me
Dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

House-trained dogs
Wild dogs
Say it again
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?

// Bop Gun //

Are you ready to get over there, huh?
Are you ready to get over there?

On guard, defend yourself
On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard, defend yourself
On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard, defend yourself
On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard, defend yourself
On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard

How many of y'all wanna get over the hump?

Come on, come on, come on
I see you tryin' to get loose
I said we should own the curve
Let's get that funky, funk

I said to try them on
And instead in the funk
Let's shoot them with the bop gun, baby
Say it

On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard, protect yourself

Baby
Tryin' to get loose
Let me shoot them with the bop gun, baby

Endangered species

Let me shoot them with the bop gun

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard

When the syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Come on and funk with me

On guard, defend yourself
Said I'm tryin' to get loose
And the prison gonna come
Let's get that funk on, baby

I said you turn 'em on again
It's burning the room
Unless you can bring them up again

On guard, defend yourself
I said I'm tryin' to let loose
On Saturday
On guard, protect yourself

To dance is a protection
Funk is your direction
All you got to do is
Funk and dance

On guard, defend yourself
Said I'm tryin' to let loose
On Saturday
On guard, protect yourself

I got to get over the hump
I got to get over the hump
Got to get over the hump
We gotta meet with y'all
I got to get over the hump

If y'all don't mind
They don't mind
I said, if you don't mind
They don't mind

Take your time tonight, yeah
Try to get over the hump, take your time
I see you been trapped on this tricky journey
I want y'all to sing
Come on, y'all
(Way to get over the hump)
You can do better than that

// Cosmic Slop //

Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call
Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call

I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong"
Then the devil sang

"Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop"

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She says, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong"
