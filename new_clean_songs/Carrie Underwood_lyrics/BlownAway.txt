Album: BlownAway

// Good Girl //

Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you're thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Better listen to me, he's low, low, low

Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he's really good at lying
Yeah, he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don't mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don't know where he's been

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he's no good, girl
Why can't you see?
He'll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, he's no good
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes

// Blown Away //

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away

// Two Black Cadillacs //

Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
(Two black Cadillacs)

It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn't bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// See You Again //

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won't cry, 'cause I know I'll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone

// Do You Think About Me //

That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the Earth stood still
You said we don't have to, I said I will, yeah
We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don't wanna watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside 'fore it was too late

Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you? Yeah

I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters 'til the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in, I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It's funny how he used to sing it, too
But he was always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me

Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Ooh, yeah

Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could've been like
When you're sittin' there drinking coffee
Are you thinkin' of me
When it's thunderin' and rainin' outside?

Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin'
Oh I, oh I, it's sendin' me flyin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me?

// Forever Changed //

She remembers the nights he'd come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child
Forever changed

Some days she'll talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when she's coming over
And why she hasn't called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As time creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me
Watching her memories slip away a little more

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever child
Forever loved
Forever changed

// Nobody Ever Told You //

Take off all the makeup, girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don't be shy, don't be scared
You don't have to hide under there
Let's throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you
Yeah
La, la, la, la, la

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Acting like it knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
It doesn't care what's underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesn't have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you
Na, na, na, na

Free as a bird up on a wire
Just like a flower growing wild
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

Nobody ever told you
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you

Yeah, oh
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
You need to know what nobody ever told you
Na, na, na, na
Oh, you're free as a bird up on a wire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just like a flower growing wild
Just like a flower growing wild
Na, na, na, na

// One Way Ticket //

If you're tired of your life and the way that you feel
Like a fish on a hook, like a bug on a dirty windshield, it's ok
It's time to take your chips and cash 'em all in
'Cause it matters where you're going
Not where you been, say hey
Goodbye yesterday
Well, if life don't go your way
Maybe it's time to take a break
Yeah, yeah

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, uh, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket

So pack up your smile and your new flip flops
We're headed to a heaven where the beat don't stop
We'll dance the day and the night away
Grab yourself a gal, grab yourself a fella
Grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
Goodbye yesterday
Whenever life don't go your way
Well, maybe it's time to take a nice long break

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, woo, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

So raise your hands in the air tonight
Raise your hands in the air tonight, whoa
Punch that clock and call it a day
Say adios to the minimum wage
Tell your boss man where he can stick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Life is so good, it's sticky sweet
It's a carnival cotton candy treat
Unwrap it like a lollipop, lick it, hey
We got a one way ticket

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whoa-oh-oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, oh

// Thank God For Hometowns //

Yesterday I got a call
Someone I didn't know at all had passed away
Mama said, "Yeah, you know him
You went to school with both his kids
They lived out on Prescott lane"
She said, "You should've seen the line
Mrs. Johnson said to tell you hi"

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes 'em go 'round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
'Cause when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah

Last June, my cousin tied the knot
Didn't know if I'd go or not
But I'm sure glad I did
It was a pretty good haul, but worth the drive
I could feel myself come back to life
The closer that I'd get
First red light, I rolled the windows down
Breathed it in and took a look around

Thank God for hometowns
First kisses and touchdowns
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns

I always find another piece of me
Walking down these old familiar streets

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes 'em go 'round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Thank God for hometowns

// Good In Goodbye //

I heard you laughing
In a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl up on your shoulders
Happy, I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you

As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holdin' on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday, you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes, there's good in goodbye

I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah, I'm happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'd see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet

But as bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holdin' on to someone that you got to let go
Someday, you'll see the reason why
Yeah, sometimes, yeah, sometimes, there's good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As bad as it was, yeah, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holdin' on to someone that you got to let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah, someday you'll see the reason why
There's good in goodbye, yeah
Yeah

There's good in goodbye, mmm

// Leave Love Alone //

Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think it's real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

Ooh, ooh, yeah
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
Hey!

Ain't it funny how love can make you fly?
Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you can't walk to the other side
Ain't it funny how love can make you fly?

Ooh, I can't stop it
Ooh, gotta have it, want it
I can't help it
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone (Can't leave it alone)
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
Hey!

Oh, come on!
Burn me once, but it don't sink in
I just keep coming back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave, I can't leave it
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave
I can't leave it alone
I can't leave it

// Cupid's Got A Shotgun //

Oh, he gave up on arrows a long, long time ago
Turns out I'm too hard to hit, so he put away his bow
I might just keep on running from here to Timbuktu
'Cause he gave up on arrows and I ain't bulletproof

Yeah, Cupid's got a shotgun, aimin' at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as can be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me

He's sitting in that tree stand and his wings are camouflage
I'm dug down in my foxhole, waiting on his next barrage
It must be open season, got a target on my back
Think he's throwing love grenades and I'm under attack

Yeah, Cupid's got a shotgun, aimin' at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as can be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me, yeah

Well, he's got me in his sights, I've got a red dot on my chest
But little does he know, I strapped on my Kevlar vest
I pulled out my Remington and I loaded up these shells
He's about to find out I'm a dang good shot myself

Yeah, Cupid's got a shotgun, aimin' at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as can be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me
Yeah, Cupid's got a shotgun
But right now, he's running from me, woo!

// Wine After Whiskey //

Once upon a time, our world was on fire
And I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits
Guess I had a lot to learn
'Cause fire turns to embers
Embers to ashes that blow away too soon
Now everything after you is like

Having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you, babe
To you don't even miss me
Once you've tasted a love that strong, you can't go back
And you can't settle on anything less
And that's what gets me
It's like having wine after whiskey

Lookin' back, I guess it's really for the best
Still you're something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go
You're a habit hard to break
I got used to bein' high
And nothing that I try seems good enough right now
It's all so watered down

Like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you, babe
To you don't even miss me
Once you've tasted a love that strong
You can't go back and you can't settle on anything less
And that's what gets me
It's like having wine after whiskey

Once you've tasted a love that strong, you can't go back
And you can't settle on anything less
And that's what gets me
It's like having wine
It's like having wine after whiskey

// Who Are You //

Who are you
The one for whom I'd really gladly suffer
Who are you
The one I'd always love above another
You're my world, you're my hope
You're all my dreams and all my heart

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do

Who are you
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who are you
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
You're in my thoughts, you know my mind
You are my fate, you are my light

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do

You're my savior, you're my center
My beginning and my end
The one I live for, you're my angel
Who are you
You're in my thoughts (In my thoughts)
You know my mind (You know my mind)
You are my fate, you are my light

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do
Who are you
Who fell on me like fire
Who are you
Who takes me through desire

Who are you
You're the one I'd give my life to
