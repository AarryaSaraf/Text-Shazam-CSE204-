// Wasted //

Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back
Let's face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, "I see the way out and I'm gonna take it"

I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, "It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it"

'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted

She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floatin' side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted

// Don't Forget To Remember Me //

18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
"Baby, don't forget"

Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
"Hey mama, don't forget

To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl

Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me"

Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place

Yeah, I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me"

// Some Hearts //

I've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
Always stumblin' around in circles
But I must've stumbled into something
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?
I wake up feeling like my life's worth living
Can't recall when I last felt that way
I guess it must be all this love you're giving
Never knew, never knew it could be like this
But I guess

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky, lucky sometimes

Now who'd have thought someone like you could love me
You're the last thing my heart expected
Who'd have thought I'd ever find somebody
Someone who, someone who makes me feel like this
Well, I guess

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes (Sometimes)
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes

Ooh
Even hearts like mine
Get lucky, lucky sometimes
Even hearts like mine
Ohhh

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Yeah, some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Yeah, some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes (Sometimes)
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Ooh (Sometimes)

// Jesus Take The Wheel //

She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel"

It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel"
"Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"

Oh, woah, ooh

// The Night Before (Life Goes On) //

Sittin' up on the roof
Sneakin' a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon and the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says, "I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Ooh
A tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm, he says
"Come on baby, let's get out of here"
They take one last drive around town
And man, it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says, "Life ain't fair
And this growing up stuff man, I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Yeah, that's what my mama told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yeah, there's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is, they don't have long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Lessons Learned //

There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts
That had some bitter endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I cannot undo
Some things
I wish I could do all, all over again

But it don't really matter
Life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart
I'm grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned

There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads
I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds
That I wish I could have one more chance to mend

But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart
I'm grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned

And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past ('Cause it's gone)
And you just gotta move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart
I'm grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Lessons learned

// Before He Cheats //

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know 

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh

// Starts With Goodbye //

I was sittin' on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standin' at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leavin' things behind
Sometimes life's so bittersweet

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

Time heals
The wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
Starts with goodbye
Like falling when you're trying to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life (Yeah)
Starts with goodbye

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah

// I Just Can't Live A Lie //

Lately, nothin' I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier
'Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can't watch you walk away
Can I forget about the way it feels to touch you
And all about the good times that we've been through?
Could I wake up without you every day?
And would I let you walk away?

No, I can't learn to live without
And I can't give up on us now

Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I'd fail 'cause I, I just can't live a lie

Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy?
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
The way you know just what I mean

No, I can't learn to live without
Oh, so don't you give up on us now

Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I'd fail 'cause I, I just can't live a lie

Oh, and I don't wanna try
Oh, I know I could say we're through
And tell myself I'm over you

But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I'd fail 'cause I, I just can't live a lie (I just can't live a lie)
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I'd fail 'cause I, I just can't live a lie

Oh, I can't live a lie
Oh, I can't live a lie

// We're Young And Beautiful //

While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I'm special
Cover me with sweetness
'Cause a time will come
When we're not so young, and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Living free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin' in our bare feet
'Cause when the summer's done
We might not be so young, and beautiful

It's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
We'll party down on Main street
Wearing next to nothing
Feelin' every heart beat
Havin' fun, while we're still young and beautiful

Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful

Beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful

Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful
Oh, so beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
Cover me with sweetness
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it, like you mean it
Like you mean it, like you mean it, like you do
Oh, yeah
Oh, so beautiful

// That's Where It Is //

In the circles I've been running
I've covered many miles
And I could search forever for what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it, it slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is

When I'm crashing through the madness
I'm not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is

It's a lifetime filled with tight embraces
The biggest things in the smallest places

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is

In the sweetest smile, on a night like this
And a tender touch, that's where it is
When we're tangled up, and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is

// Whenever You Remember //

When you look back on times we had
I hope you smile
And know that through the good and through the bad
I was on your side, when nobody could hold us down
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
And no, they won't forget

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

When you think back on all we've done
I hope you're proud
When you look back and see how far we've come
It was our time to shine
And nobody could hold us down
They thought they'd see us fall
But we, we stood so tall
And no, we won't forget, yeah

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
Yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
You know that we, we showed them all
And no, they won't forget
Yeah

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

Whenever you remember
Ooh, whenever you remember

// I Ain't In Checotah Anymore //

Where sixty-nine meets forty
There's a single stop light town
And back when I was really young
A part of that burned down
On any given Friday night
We'd drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the grocery store
Laughing all the while
With as many friends as I could pack, in my daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house
I'd rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
Than hailing cabs here in New York
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind

In a world of long red carpets
The bright lights of Hollywood
All the paparazzi flashing
Could make a girl feel pretty good
You can get anything you want here
Except a Walmart store
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind

Where the Wildcats beat the Ironheads
Old Settler's day and the OkraFest
After prom, down at the bowling lanes
Catching crappie fish in Eufaula Lake
I ain't in Checotah anymore

Oh yeah
I'm in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind
But I ain't in Checotah
No, I ain't in Checotah
Oh, there's nothing like Oklahoma

Where sixty-nine meets forty
There's a single stoplight town

// Inside Your Heaven //

I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
