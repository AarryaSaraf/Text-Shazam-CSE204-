Album: Flyer

// The Flyer //

He was a flyer for the Air Force
On a plane from San Antonio
I was traveling to London
He was going off to Buffalo
Changing planes in Pittsburgh
We got grounded in a storm
Now, I would give anything
To be on that flyer's arm

We played cards, mostly blackjack
As we sat out on the tarmac
We sang songs we knew in Spanish
As we both loved songs of language
He'd heard me on the radio
I'd seen the flyers on San Antone
Now, I would give anything
To have that flyer for my own

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

He said he'd never married
'Cause, his heart was in the clouds
And I said I was too clumsy
That I broke the wings of the loves I found
He shouted out his name to me
As I ran to make my flight
Now, I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

One year I watched a war in London
In the airport leaving London
And I wondered if I'd know him
If I saw his wings in motion
Did I leave my heart in Pittsburgh
In the lightening of that flight?
I wish that you could tell me now
Will he be flyin' home tonight?

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

// Nobody's Angel //

Something's disturbed me
I'm out of your company
I'm out of the country
With another man's heart
I'm angered and doubtful
And I'd shout a earful
But nothing comes out
When I open my mouth

I'm nobody's angel now
(She's out of the country now)
I'm nobody's angel now
(She's out of the country now)
'Cause if I can't give love
I can't rise up above these clouds
So, I'm nobody's angel now

I was the forest for love songs
The one who can't love wrong
The one who won't fall
But will still write it down
I'm the one who would understand
Who listens with pen in hand
On everyone's shoulder
Till it's me who falls down

I'm nobody's angel now
(She's out of the country now)
I'm nobody's angel now
(She's out of the country now)
'Cause if I can't give love
I can't rise up above these clouds
So, I'm nobody's angel now

I'm grounded and rusty
My dance card is dusty now
Because I wanted to be
What the angels see
When they look down
Just a couple on the avenue
With their feet on the ground

I'm nobody's angel now

Something's disturbed me
I'm out of your company
I'm out of the country now
Something's disturbed me
I'm out of your company
I'm out of the country now
I'm nobody's angel now
(She's out of the country now)
Nobody's angel now
(She's out of it)
I'm out of the country now
I'm out of the country now
And nobody's angel now

// Say It Isn't So //

When you say I love you
Is it just because you know that's what I want to hear?
And lately friends are warning me
What they hesitate to tell me leaves a thread of fear
People talk around this town
And when the final truth comes down
There's only one thing left to do
It's come back 'round to you
(Come back 'round to you)

Say it isn't so
Tell me that you're someone
I'll believe in
Am I the last to know
That you don't love me anymore?
Uh if you ever did
Say it isn't so
Am I caught up in a web
You are weaving?
Oh, the stories I've been told
Indicate that you're already
Reachin' for the door

It's just a lover's situation
Are you in or out of love?
I've heard those words before
I've had to face up to the truth
'Cause staying and pretending
Would had hurt him more
Sometimes lovers stay too long
Sometimes they leave too soon
But there's only one thing left to do
It's come back 'round to you
(Come back 'round to you)

And say it isn't so
Tell me that you're someone
I'll believe in
Am I the last to know
That you don't love me anymore?
If you ever did
Say it isn't so
Am I caught up in a web
That you are weaving?
Oh, the stories I've been told
Indicate that you're already
Reachin' for the door

Oh, the stories I've been told
Baby say it isn't so

// Southbound Train //

I'm sitting on a southbound train
Staring at the sky
I'm thinking of my childhood
And I'm trying not to cry
While a stranger sleeps against me
And it feels like I'm his wife
The towns and cities flutter past
Like the pages of my life

My heart is on the baggage rack
It's heavy as can be
I wish that I could find someone
Who would carry it for me
Just to pay it some attention
And to handle it with care
Because it has been dropped and
Is in need of some repair

Some things I know
Some things I guess
Some things I wish I could learn
To express
Like the way that I feel
As I stare at the sky
And I remember your voice
And the sound of goodbye

0r maybe it's the autumn... chill
Maybe it's the rain
Maybe I should wake the stranger
And ask him his name
But, my eyes they would betray me
And my words could not defend
No, I must learn to wait my turn
Before I love again

Some things I know
Some things I guess
Some things I wish that I could learn
To express
Like the way that I feel
As I stare at the sky
And I remember your voice
And the sound of goodbye

// These Days In An Open Book //

Shut it down and call this road a day
And put this silence in my heart in a better place
I have traveled with your ghost now for so many years
That I see you in the shadows
In hotel rooms and headlights
You're coming up beside me
Whether it's day or night

These days my life is an open book
Missing pages I cannot seem to find
These days your face
In my memory
Is in a folded hand of grace against these times

No one's ever come between your memory and me
I have driven this weary vessel here alone
Will you still find me if I leave you here beside this road
'Cause I need someone who can touch me
Who'll put no one above me
Someone who needs me
Like the air he breathes

These days my life is an open book
Missing pages I cannot seem to find
These days your face
In my memory
Is in a folded hand of grace against these times

I can't remember where this toll road goes
Maybe it's Fort Worth maybe it's a heart of gold
The price of love is such a heavy toll
That I've lived my life in the backroads
With your love in my pocket
If I spend the love you gave me
Tell me, where will it go?

These days my life is an open book
Missing pages I cannot seem to find
These days your face
In my memory
Is in a folded hand of grace against these times

These days your face
In my memory
Is in a folded hand of grace
You're a folded hand of grace
You're in a folded hand of grace
Against these times

// Time Of Inconvenience //

Time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time

We're living in a time of inconvenience
Compassion fails me with this meaness in the air
City streets are filled with violence
So we close our doors to the city
And pretend that it's not there
Here I go again
Back out on these mean streets
The evil seems to cling to the soles of my feet
Because I'm living in a time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

We're living in the age of communication
Where the only voices heard have money in their hands
Where greed has become a sophistication
And if you ain't got money
You ain't got nothin' in this land
But, here I am one lonely woman
On these mean streets
Where the right to life man has become my enemy
'Cause I'm living in his time of inconvenience
At an inconvenient time

And I've turned my cheek
As my history fades
While the clock ticks away
Any progress we've made
I never thought
I'd be ashamed to be human
Afraid to say
My time has seen its day
Because I'm living in a time of inconvenience
Living in a time of inconvenience
Living in a time of inconvenience
In an inconvenient time

This is a time of greed and power
Where everyone needs to have someone to shove around
Our children come to us for answers
Listening for freedom but they don't know the sound
And there they are, our children
Dumped out in these mean streets
The evil sweeps them up
And brings them to their knees
Because they're living in our time of inconvenience
They're living in the age of communication
This is a time of greed and power
This is a time that I wish was not mine
Because it's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time
It's an inconvenient time

// Don't Forget About Me //

I can't be your weather
'Cause if it rains then it rains
I can't be your lover
'Cause the feelings would change
I can't be the wind
'Cause the wind blows too free
But if you want a true companion
Don't forget about me

Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me

Friends never leave you
They're a two way street
They'll always believe in you
When you've ceased to believe
And I'll still feel the same
If you're a friend in need
'Cause, I'll always love you
Don't forget about me

Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me

Don't forget about me
When your heart's in the shade
When there's no one to hold you
And you've fallen from grace
When the spotlights come blind you
And you can no longer see
I'll be right there beside you
Don't forget about me

Don't forget about me

// Always Will //

I saw you on the avenue
You looked so tired and a little blue
You were in your Sunday best
Your father's tie upon your chest

Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

In the corridor of one hotel
We once crossed paths I recall it well
Voices in an empty hall
Slamming doors to hearts that fall

Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

Always will always will
Hey
Always will always will
Hey

Love has been my passer by
I stood too still to catch your eye
But there out on the avenue
In your father's tie I'll remember you

Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

Hey, you always will

// Going Back To Georgia //

Oh, the city snow makes your brown eyes shine
We've gotta look real hard to find a reason to cry
New York, New York is a friend of the traveling kind

And I'm coming around from years of hard times
He's chased me down through the towns and the miles
Once stilled by love he was bound to roll on by

And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there

Well, I'm long gone darlin', lonesome blue
I been thinking of leavin', I been thinkin' of you
But that big city singin', man, I like the way that it shines

I was half a mile from Canada waitin' on a train
Wonderin' and wishin' I could disappear again
I been killed by love still it takes me to the end of the line

And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there

Well, I've been troubled by love untrue
He's a fool who'll drown in his fountain of youth
I can see that now as I'm walkin' and talkin' with you

Well, I been blinded by the sun, washed in the rain
Scattered in America, I'm scatterin' again
But if you're goin' south darlin' I guess I'm travelin' with you

And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there

And if you feel my love won't leave you
And if your sorrow has been your share
If you are traveling back to Georgia
Won't you take me with you there

Take me with you
Oh, won't you take me home
Yeah

// Talk To Me While I'm Listening //

I should have known that you were gone back in Germany
You told me in the dark while I was sleeping
Then you slept through the sunrise
As it washed across your face
And all that I had heard were our hearts beating

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

I cannot find a place to put this love away
Or lose the thought of sunlight on your face
I thought I heard your voice
Say I love you today
But it was only the sound of my heart beating

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

How I wish that I could take us back to Germany
I would stay awake and you would talk to me
Yet for every drop of rain I hear
There's bound to fall another tear
Upon this page of song of my heart aching

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

Talk to me
Talk to me

// Fragile //

I look out on these shields of heather
Across this countryside
I wonder how they've grown together
While people live such separate lives
I think I'll stay inside for the winter
'Cause the weather's in my bones
And the wind could shatter bone to splinter
Then howl me back home

I'm fragile as the lady of the harbor
As fragile as her torch that glows
As fragile as the gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast... to the Texas coast

I stared up at the faces in the mountain
Just a year ago
Laughin' in the spirit of America
And singin' in the snow
Now I wish I felt as strong as that mountain
Just carved in stone
I wish I was the gulf stream water
And I could sail you home

I'm fragile as the lady of the harbor
As fragile as her torch that glows
As fragile as the gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast... to the Texas coast

I would give you all that's in me
Though part of me is gone
If I could have that day upon the mountain
For the snow and the song
But here's to love and all that it changes
When you're alone out in the storm
If I'd had a shield of heather
I'd have never loved at all

I'm fragile as the lady of the harbor
As fragile as her torch that glows
As fragile as the gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast... to the Texas coast

I would sail you home
To the Texas coast
I would sail you home
To the Texas coast

// On Grafton Street //

On Grafton Street at Christmas time
The elbows push you 'round
This is not my place of memories
I'm a stranger in this town
And the faces seem familiar
And I know those songs they're playin'
But I close my eyes and find myself
Five thousand miles away

It's funny how my world goes round without you
Oh, you're the one thing I never thought
I could live without
I just found this smile to think about you
You're a Saturday night
Far from the madding crowd

The buskers sing by candle light
In front of Bewleys Store
And a young nun offers me a chair
At a table by the door
And I feel compelled to tell her
Of the sisters that we knew
How when they lit their candles
I'd say a prayer for you

It's funny how my world goes round without you
Oh, you're the one thing I never thought
I could live without
And I just found this smile to think about you
You're a Saturday night
Far from the madding crowd

The church bells ring for holy hour
And I'm back out in the rain
It's been twenty years or more
Since I last said your name
And I hear you live near Dallas now
In a house out on the plains
Why Grafton Street brought you to mind
I really can't explain

It's funny how my world goes round without you
You're the one thing I never thought
I could live without
And I just found this smile to think about you
You're a Saturday night
Far from the madding crowd

On Grafton Street at Christmas time
The elbows push you 'round
All I carry now are memories
I'm a stranger to this town

// Anything You Need But Me //

Let me say this one more time
Just in case you didn't hear it right
I'd put it in my own words
So I'll know it's understood
You sent me out on a limb
You brought me home... sent me back again
Out on that limb one too many times
You should've known I'd learn to fly

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

Well, I'm shattered as the broken glass
Around the wreck out on the tracks
You had the very heart of me in your hands with honesty
You rolled it up within your sleeve like a beacon
Then you left it out
In the cold and the rain
I've picked it up and brought it home again

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

Well, it's time to move the lights are green
After all it's love we need
And if it doesn't dance and breathe
Then it doesn't grow it seems
My headlights catch you with my love upon your sleeve
You're standin' still in the middle of this road
It's time to pass you by and go

You can have anything on earth you need
Anything that breathes you can surely still its wings
You can have everything on earth you see
Anything on earth you need but me
You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me

You can have anything you need but me now
Anything on earth you need but me
Anything on earth you need but me

// Goodnight To A Mother's Dream //

Flippin' bottle caps through the ring around the moon
All alone on a Saturday night with the stars in bloom
I am a vision of my mother's dream come true
Built this house out in the hills
All by my own will
I've got love enough for two
But it's just me and this old moon

And the sailors on the water
They all want the captain's daughter
They want her beauty and her youth
To grace their bow out on the sea
Me, I'm getting older and I'm plain
As plain as can be
Got a bank full of mother's dreams
Maybe mother just didn't see
That love would be the only thing
Her daughter would ever need

Oh, I am the heart not taken
The one thought not worth breakin'
I am the late blooming rose
With only her mother's dream to hold
On this less traveled road
Who really knows
Maybe the hearts not taken
Are truly made of gold

I'm gonna flip one more bottle cap up at the moon
I've got an early call with so much work to do
But, when I go inside I'm gonna let my back door slam
Mother, to tell you the truth
I would trade your dream away
Just to hear some loved one say
I love you, too

And the sailors on the water
They all want the captain's daughter
They want her beauty and her youth
To grace their bow out on the sea
Me, I'm getting older and I'm plain
As plain as can be
Got a bank full of mother's dreams
Maybe mother just didn't see
That love would be the only thing
Her daughter would ever need

Say goodnight to the moon
I'll say I love you to the moon
And to my mother too
'Bueños sueños' to the moon

// This Heart //

This heart was almost taken
This heart had a love of its own
This heart was reawakened
When you came along

This heart was born feet running
This heart saw your porch-light on
This heart hit the sidewalk wondering
Why you left it on

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart hears the telephone ringing
This heart's gonna let it go
'Cause this heart knows the bells she's hearing
Aren't the telephone

This heart has heard your laughter
This heart has learned how to smile
This heart'll be your true believer
If you stay a while

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart was almost taken
This heart was born feet running
This heart hears the telephone ringing
Gonna let it go

This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
