// Cherry Flavored Stomach Ache //

Tried to withdraw a guilt plea
(Damn) You ain't gonna pin this one on me
One thing's for sure, I'm not sleeping here tonight
And I'm not interested in what you think is right

She gets so lonely, she can't relate to anyone
She turns on the television and slips into a dream
She woke up in a scream
Take it easy on her

I'm not gonna see you anymore
'Cause you're not strong enough
And you're not smart enough
And you're not cool enough

Looking out the window of the cafe
There's a boy with cherry coloured lips
More like cherry flavored stomach ache

She gets so lonely, she can't relate to anyone
She picks up her phone to check the latest gossip
If you're up or you're down it's just a toss up

I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore

// Christmas Wrapping 2020 (All I Want For Christmas Is A Vaccine) //

Oh no, oh no
Woke up this morning
Thought I was still dreaming
Album of the year nominees
Seems like Jews are now mainstreaming
News Alert: Oh god what happened?
Wish I was still sleeping
Spent too many days this year
On Tik Tok, drinking wine, and weeping
90 degrees and stores all shut
Biden/Harris, no utter disasters
December 10th, Oh Hanukkah!
No time to Netflix chess grandmasters
So TV off, tried to escape
But remembered our good ol' "Stay in place!"
Bypassed Amazon and Instagram
To locally sourced millennial Judaica

Zoom'd my sis and parents up
Mom said my skin looked oily
Changed the subject to the fact
That mom's shirt looks just like a doily
My menorah's lost, I'm breaking out
Depressed from having zero sex
Dad interjects, latkes a mess
The Cuisinart stopped working

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
2020 has been mighty wild!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Cut my own hair now I'm Yentl styled
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
2020 has been mighty wild!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Cut my own hair now I'm Yentl styled

Tried to write a Hanukkah song
For the year that's been unending
Called our friend who wrote "Slave Play"
And another one who loves Anime (Jeremy said!)
Reface app, Insta thirst traps
WAP-ing in the mirror
Buy my play it's called "Slave Play"
Wait are we in a Tony campaign?
It's Hanukkah! During COVID-19
What the hell does anything mean?
I stay awake way too late
'Cause Neo-Nazis made Pizzagate
And that for three whole months
In major cities in every state
No food is left on the street
Each other is all that rats ate

Seven o'clock, I hear a ring
Look over at my door
See a masked delivery man
Holding four menorahs
One from mom, one from sis
Another from sis, and another from
Our secret fourth sis
Our little Frankie Jonas
To my surprise hers is the best
So simple and unadorned
Burst into tears and began to cry
2020 has been full of lies
But even its most hellish months
Have offered sweet surprises:
Bye bye Trump
We saved Forrest Gump
Zendaya got her trophy
We can't go to restaurants but
My boyfriend made Macaroni!

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
2020 has been mighty wild!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Cut my own hair now I'm Yentl styled
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
2020 has been mighty wild!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Cut my own hair now I'm Yentl styled
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
2020 has been mighty wild!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Cut my own hair now I'm Yentl styled

// Feel The Thunder //

Hah, come on
(Woh-oh)

Can you hear?
The sisters of thunder round here
Crash, poom-pow
It's coming right through the clouds
I got a need for speed
I'm gonna bring you down to your knees
It's big, it's loud
Yeah, we're on the prowl

Feel it shaking to your core
Feel it quaking but you want more

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder (feel the thunder) feel the noise (feel the noise)
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy

(Come on, sisters)

Can you see?
Our power's shaking the trees
Bam, boom-bang
You know we can't be tamed
We can't slow down
We're taking you to thunder town
On vines we swing
We're getting you in the ring

Feel it rumble (here we go) to your core
You took a tumble but you want more

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder (feel the thunder) feel the noise (feel the noise)
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy

You want more? uh-huh

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy

// If It Be Your Will //

If it be your will
That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will

// Little Of Your Love (BloodPopÂ® Remix) //

Give me just a little of your love

You're just another recovering heart (hey)
I wasn't even gonna try
You wouldn't even give up time
Could, could be so easy, you make it hard (hey)
Don't think about love too much
My love is gonna be enough

You're so close now
And I know now

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love

Don't it feel like that night was from a dream (hey)
I've never felt nothing like that
Looking at you, looking right back
Don't, don't say nothing is ever as good as it seems (hey)
Stop running your mouth like that
'Cause you know I'm gonna give it right back

You're so close now
(Don't let me down)
So don't let me down

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love

Oh with a little strength baby
Oh, I'll never let you down
With a little love, a little love, a little love, a little love
Give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love

You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)

// Lost Track //

Tryin' to get on top
But it's never easy
Mastered my own luck
But it wasn't easy
I'm tryin' to feel alright
Around all these people
I try, but I'm just numb
This time

Deepest cut that I can't feel
Find my grip on the steering wheel
I know our pieces stuck
You can sit down if you don't mind me standin' up (Mind me standin' up)
I know I was too good to pass up (Too good to pass up)
Meeting you caused a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
I'd take the smallest crumb
But I'll never get back what I lost track of

Laugh when I'm still cryin'
Yeah, you know the deal
Burnt but it's still frying (Huh)
Yeah, you know the deal
Can't redeem my love
At such a steal
But you can't say I'm not tryin'
This time

Deepest cut that I can't feel
Find my grip on the steering wheel
I know our pieces stuck
You can sit down if you don't mind me standin' up (Mind me standin' up)
I know I was too good to pass up (Too good to pass up)
Meeting you caused a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
I'd take the smallest crumb
But I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of
I'll never get back what I lost track of

I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track
I'll never get back but I've lost track

// My Song 5 (Remix) //

Talk to me nice or don't talk to me

I found it hard
Tried to reserve
I'll get it right
When I am heard
(Hot for me)
The man's his own
(Hot for me)
And to her he'll go
(Hot for me)
But I'll be fine
(Hot for me)
'Cause I know

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to, so what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in, all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying so
Honey, I'm not your honey pie

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

If you want to see me, baby please
Been holding on for eternity
Say you only want me
Missing you never led to much of anything
If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
What it means, what it seemed, seemed to be
Held by a thread, tried to forget
But I'll never let it go

[A$AP Ferg:]
Can you handle the truth? I don't think you can
Jealous now 'cause I'm working with this female band
She wanna consume the world and get all females banned
Always talkin' about marriage, I don't see those plans
And yes, I cheated once and so did you
You let your girl eat you out like a bowl of soup
And how you didn't include Mr. Master Bruce?
Two girls in the nude I couldn't wait to intrude
I couldn't wait to penetrate the both of you two
You probably woulda been scared I wasn't noticing you
Scared I'd be occupied with your friend, my nose in the boobs
But we ain't play that game cause you probably would lose
Honey pie, don't front like you goodie-two-shoes
You ain't got no money, how'd you get those shoes?
I put the clothes on your back, this the thanks I get?
Is this April? This must be a prank of some shit

He's in her heart on the floor, thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through the crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head, seeing all the words unsaid
Honey honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to, so what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in, all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying so
Honey, I'm not your honey pie

So you say you wanna be a Rockstar

Pump your fist in the air and wait two weeks to wash your hair
Step 3

Step 4
Never do what you're told because there's no rules in rock 'n' roll

When you
When you kick open the gates you gotta pay respect to all of the greats
Before
Before you're ready to play you better, better, better know your history
Punk, new wave, metal, ska

// Stop //

I know you and me
Everything was supposed to be
But I don't really want to
I don't really understand how that has to be
How can I breathe?
How can I breathe?
It's not, it's not that easy

I know that you want this to keep up going on
But I don't really want to
You just need to understand that this is all wrong
Why can't you see?
Why can't you please just stop?
Just stay away from me

I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop

Cause you have some place to go
And you have some place to show
And I have some place to show
And you have some place to show

Why can't things just stay, so they'll always be the same
Cause I don't really want to
I don't really understand how things have to change
Why can't you see?
Why can't you please just stop?
Stop suffocating me

I know that you want this to keep up going on
But I can't decide
I can not decide
I can not decide
How can I breathe?
How can I breathe?
Just stop, just stay away from me

I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop
I came to say
Stop
I came to say
Stop, Stop

That you have some place to go
And I got some place to show
And I have some place to go
And you got some place to show

// That Don't Impress Me Much //

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve, just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
'Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
(Ah ah oh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
Make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
(Ah ah oh)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on those long, cold and lonely nights
That don't impress me much

That don't impress me much
That don't impress me much
That don't impress me much
That don't impress me much...
That don't impress me much
Oh no

// Walking Away (Mura Masa Remix) //

You don't wanna talk, don't wanna work it out
If you were gonna face it, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a...
I waited hours and hours, hearing loud sirens
Suffered til' I saw it differently
You see, now I'm not coming around
Coming around, coming around

I'm walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
...

You don't wanna give and you don't wanna know how
If you were gonna change things, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a...
Trying not think about it, baby
Run it up and down the stairs
'Til there's nothing left between us but what we won't say

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
...

I know I said it so many times before
But now it's keeping me awake
I know you did it so many times before
But I never thought I'd be the one you'd betray
(Walking away...)
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you can say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
(Walking away...)
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you can say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
