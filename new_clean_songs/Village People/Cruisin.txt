// The Women //

Well!

Who has been the center, world's greatest attraction
Since the beginning of time? (A woman!)
What can hypnotize the eyes with body motion
Flowing like the ocean's tide? (A woman!)

Woman is so mysterious
You know a woman is so voluptuous
A woman spreads joy with every smile
I say a woman's face makes me scream (Aaah!)

I love the women!
Although they are women
Those who like too many things
Silver slippers, diamond rings
Those who carry themselves just like a queen! (Aaah!)

I love the women!
Let's dance with the women
When you dance you catch our eyes
When you dance you hypnotize
The world!

Who can wrap a man around her little finger
With the taste of her sweet charm? (A woman!)
Who can make a man drop everything he's doing
Stops the world till she's all right? (A woman!)

A woman, magic she must possess
You see a woman has charm and finesse
A woman keeps lit her light of love
I said a woman's kiss makes me scream (Aaah!)

I love the women!
Although they are women
Those who like too many things
Silver slippers, diamond rings
Those who carry themselves just like a queen! (Aaah!)

I love the women!
Let's dance with the women
When you dance you catch our eyes
When you dance you hypnotize
The world! Yeah

Silver slippers, diamond rings
Those who carry themselves just like a queen! (Aaah!)

Let's dance with the women
When you dance you catch our eyes
When you dance you hypnotize
The world!

// My Roommate //

Mmmmmh Yeahhhh

I swear to you people, it must be my fate.
The cards were against me, now there's no escape.
I have this here problem, who keeps me up late.
(My roommate, my roommate.)

He thinks he's the greatest, dancer of all time.
He never stops dancin', he's out of his mind.
In the bathroom singing, a pitch out of time.
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
(I can't take much more.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he's driving me insane.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he plays so many games.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he breaks all of the rules.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he is a dancing fool.)

I go to the closet, to put on my coat.
Instead on the hanger, I find pinned a note.
"I went to the disco, I took your best coat."
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I come home real early, thinking he's asleep.
Instead I am greeted, by big ugly feet.
"I've got this new dance step, five, six, seven, eight."
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
(I can't take much more.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he's driving me insane.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he plays so many games.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he breaks all of the rules.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he is a dancing fool.)

He's a dancin' fool, ya'll.
Well, let me tell you about him.

Well, talkin' 'bout my roommate:

My roommate is the kind of guy,
who likes his music playin' high.
My roommate is the kind of guy,
who likes his music playin' high.
He dances all night, he dances all day.
He dances all night, he dances all day.

// Ups And Downs //

I gotta story for you
I just don't know what to do
You see I'm hung up on pills
I take them for my cheap thrills
I take pills all day and night
To try and make things all right
I take them when I feel down
And wanna fly

I wish I could end this trip
I have begun to like it
But truth is pills are not cool
I'd just be playing the fool
I know that reality
Is far away now from me
I wish I could find my way
Back to the ground
It's not around
It can't be found

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I wish this madness would end
Where did this pill trip begin?
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
They're either red or they're blue
I take the white and orange too
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I just don't know what to do, oh no
I feel so un-for real, oh yes
I wish that I could end this trip
I just can't take no more
Can't take no more, no no
No more

I take pills when I wake up
To get me out of my bed
I take pills when I go dance
To concentrate on the steps
I take pills when I go home
To help me fall fast asleep
I take pills when I work out
To reach my peak

Sometimes I feel very strange
Sometimes I forget my name
I can't remember the time
When real thoughts went through my mind
I need to throw all these pills
I have been popping away
I need to throw them away
Right now today
Right now today
Yes right away

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
Where did this madness begin?
I wish this pill trip would end
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
They're either red or they're blue
I take the orange and white too
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I said that I would quit today
I said that I would throw away
All the pills that I had you see
I want to be free
I wanna be free
I just want to be free
I want to be free yeah
Woah

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I don't even know my name
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I feel oh so strange

I take me a up in the morning
I take me a down late at night
I take me a up early in the evening
I take me a down to make me feel all right

So now that you've heard my tale
I hope that you'll wish me well
I hope that you'll understand
I'm doing all that I can
To make this nightmare I've got
You know it takes a strong will
But I can do it real soon
I hope I will

Life has its own ups and downs
They keep my head spinning round
Life has its own ups and downs
When there are no pills around
So tell me why do I need
To keep on taking these pills
They've got me so that I feel
So un-for real
I think I'm ill
I need a pill

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I wish this madness would end
Where did this pill trip begin?
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
They're either red or they're blue
I take the orange and white too
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
Where did this madness begin?
I wish this pill trip would end
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs...
