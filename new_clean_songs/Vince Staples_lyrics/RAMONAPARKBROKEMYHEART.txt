// THE BEACH //

Oh, yeah, everybody killa
Tryna make it to the top, we can't take everybody with us
We can't get everybody rich, we can't fuck everybody bitch
'Cause I'm afraid to catch a case, I feel like everybody snitch
And Coast West in the shivers, I be havin' premonitions
Growin' up, ain't had no license, let's just have to check the engine
'Less we have to spot the weak, show somebody that we miss 'em
I will park it, nigga shit, face got dark and niggas quick, huh
Tell me where you from, I ain't heard of that
In the city, baby, your fresh rap can be a murder rap
I will let you hold it, bitch, you gotta bring my burner back
One up in the top, I get to drop, you know I'm surfin' that
Send 'em up to heaven gates, now it's mom that's sellin' plates
Now it's homies watchin' cards, 'cause they all here actin' hard
Please, don't try to get involved 'less you on the public
'Cause my gangsters really movin', ho, don't cut 'em, niggas shootin', wait

// AYE! (FREE THE HOMIES) //

Ah
Ah
If everybody stopped so much hurt, stopped so much anger they hoard
We done lost a gang of homeboys
A lot of people, a lot of my friends got hurt
Nobody's got a lotta anger in here, so first thing, we're gonna snap at it

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Shoot a nigga momma if she out while we sliding
Go up in the house, cause, this shit get violent
Better keep your mouth shut if we hear sirens
I'ma be on death row just like Suge Knight 'nem
I stand ten toes, I'm not no buster
Seen 'em by the Winco, worked on my jumper
Baby know I'm hotter than the city in the summer
'Fore I leave the house I gotta tell her that I love her
I don't know if I'ma make it home
These niggas ain't gang banging they just singing songs
I done seen it all, bloodshot eyes
Broke my heart in the set and I'm still outside
Took a loss, took a risk, now I'm back in the mix
Watch who you keeping around when you rich
Money ain't make me
Still thuggin' till the feds come take me
Mean muggin'

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Foot up on the gas, hunnid on the dash
Blower in the stash, thirty in the mag
Hung on Cherry Ave, I ain't go to class
They don't say what's up 'cause they know it's that
In too deep, I ain't with the peace
Wanna end the beef? Tell them niggas bring my homies back
Free the Killa, he was on attack
Bitches wanna know my zodiac
Every time I fall in love, baby, do me bad
Giving up, when I went and gave it all I had
I will never chase the cat, rather chase a bag
Have fun, life short when you living fast
I'm a nigga in the set, baby, go and ask
Never go out sad, give the bro my last
If I die today, they gon' go and crash
That's on Tiny Skrap, that's on Lil' Half (Aye)

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Ah
Ah

// DJ QUIK //

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin'-

I ain't never quitting on my homies from the set
Rather die a legend than be living with regrets
Granny up in Heaven, know she watch a nigga back
G-Class flying down Orizaba Ave

I know that you love me but you gotta give me space
Money hungry women do whatever for a taste
All my people in the hood, what's it finna take
To have everybody living good? I don't wanna wait

In a minute I'ma bust a jug, I'ma make a play
Hit the homie up and hit a lick, run in where you stay
All the pressure I be dealing with still ain't never change
I'm about the money, I ain't fucking with the fame

DJ Quik
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
DJ Quik
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense

You should see the limit on my Amex
One phone call and it's niggas at your address
I'm gon' ball till I'm sitting in a grave
Fuck all y'all, bet Ramona get the last laugh

Close your mouth when you talking to a killer, bitch
They say I murdered Cuh, I say I'm innocent
This ain't suburbia, these niggas ignorant
I always get my man, I only miss my bitch

Hit me up if you wish
I'm in the studio, couple guns, couple Crips
Tryna make a hundred M's, what's a couple bands?
Keep it coming in, keep it coming in

DJ Quik
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
DJ Quik
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense

(Get paid, yeah, get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five-

// MAGIC //

Mustard on the beat, hoe

Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin' I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

If I gave a fuck about a citch, I'd always be broke
I'd never get to pull up in a Benz with my locs
Growin' up, we was poor, so we hopped off that porch
With a gun, tryna blow, tryna kick down your door
But that's old news, spreading love now
Sick of police lights, sick of gun sounds
Niggas' bread ain't up, so they come foul
But it's handshakes, hugs when I come 'round, wow
Funny style, hate to see a nigga smilin'
Hundred miles and runnin' through the public housin'
Movin' mountains, fuck who I was stumpin' down with
Gunnin' down shit, sittin' in the back of Crown Vics
So janky, know them niggas down the street still hate me
Hope lil baby know that she can't play me
Dumb hoe, love cost but the game free, dumb hoe

Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

Crip and blood shit
That's the only thing I ever been in love with it
So I hope he know we never goin' public
Hands full so I can't hold grudges, nah
I be thuggin', jumpin' out the backseat bustin'
Everybody we be beefin' with be sayin' that they bleedin' shit
But see us and they don't do nothin'
Ah, put it on the dead locs
They know I been 'bout it-'bout it since the get-go
If I hit the corner quick and better get low
You ain't with it nigga, what you from the set for?
I just wanna be successful
You won't never ever see me with my head low
Momma met my daddy, then they had me in the ghetto
Handed me a thirty-eight and told me I was special, norf

Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened
Feeling like I'm floating to the ceiling, is it magic?
Baby, tell me why you disappearin', this is magic
I won't ever tell 'em how I did it, it was magic
Can you imagine?
Money in the mattress, love the way I stack it
I can make it rain blue hundreds, can you catch it?
If somebody come through bluffin', I'ma blast 'em
And tell the police I don't know what happened

See when you come from nothing, make it into something - I call that luck
But when you come from where we come from, I call that magic
And when you get two niggas from different sides of the city, to do something like this, I guess you could call that magic
Getting off of Section 8, welfare
Now it's Rolls Royces, private jets - that's magic
Let me know what's magic to you, yeah

// NAMELESS //

I think it's wrong, but then it's called survival
You have to eat
You have to pay bills
You have to survive
So when you get used to pulling a trigger on somebody
It's not hard to pick up a gun and just shoot
You know? It's not hard after a while
It becomes easy, calming
And depending on the people that you're shooting at
And the reason for you doing it
It might even be fun

You shot someone?

That's what they said
Several times, that's what they said

Were they right?

I don't know
Bullets don't have names

// WHEN SPARKS FLY //

It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here, lovers in arms
I can feel your fear, can this love be true?
Come on lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
Lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling

She said, "Baby, keep me closely, love it when you hold me
Know that I'm a real one, I don't do no ghostin'
I know that you love me, you don't gotta show me
Off to the world, please, hide me from the police
Everywhere you go, we together, inseparable
You know I'm down for whatever, protective of you
I don't wanna use protection with you
But the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose
Never put you in a jam, hold whatever for you
When you first shot your shot, I knew you would the one to hit the spot
Only you can make it clap for the homies, I am not
On the late nights, me and you, circling the block
Tryna make it pop
Put that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park
Hope we don't get caught
Don't you break my heart
Love how you illuminate my thoughts"

It's been two years, I keep calling
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here, lovers in arms
I can feel your fear, can this love be true?
Come on lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
Lift me up, love, I keep falling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling

Damn, can't believe they took you from me
Kickin' in your front door, lookin' for me
Hid me in our secret place
Nothing I could do for you but sit and wait
Contemplate
Did we leave a trail? Did we make mistakes?
Can't drop on your bail, can't check on your case
Know that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid
You'll probably never get to see the light of day
I'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now
We should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now
At least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down
Is you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?
Still here I am, waiting 'round
Dreaming that you comin' home, right your wrongs, take me out
I can't wait until you bust it down
Probably go a hunnid rounds

I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
I keep calling
I keep calling (Oh, ooh)
I keep calling
[?]
[?]
But he's in jail right now
For something that he had no business in doin'
Put him in jail
They said he killed somebody

// EAST POINT PRAYER //

Money mantra
Hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash ya
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up

Kept it stitch lipped, I'm a factor
I was out there when it mattered
Had the chopstick with the ladder
Made it count, fled to Atlanta

Off to Camp Creek, with no Plan C
I was head first, understand me?
Gotta stay alert, understand me?
If they catch me, they gon' blast me

Bounced out, chucking up the hood
Money in the bank, so I'm feeling good
Pull up on the gang, never Hollywood
Showing them the way, so they show a nigga love, but

These lil' niggas running wild
Bought a .40 cal, out the Jordan Downs
Married to the streets, don't she get around?
I never wanna leave, I'm never out of bounds

Ain't no peacing up if you body one of us
Body for a body, big body Benz truck
Bounce out boogie, play pussy, get fucked
When these niggas get tough?

Since when these niggas want war with us?
Lick a gunshot, bloodshot corneas
I been out all night tryna make it out
Swear to God that the set was the safest route, know what they about

Money mantra
Hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash ya
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up

Kept it stitch lipped, I'm a factor
I was out there when it mattered
Had the chopstick with the ladder
Made it count, fled to Atlanta

I took big risks, now I want big fish
A billion dollars at the top of my to-do list
Buy a villa in St. Bart, maybe a cruise ship
Or really a yacht
Just to say that I got it
Product of my environment

Keep my cutter for the snakes, you know this shit can get slimy
Ain't have to make no call to gang, them they already beside me
Where the money at? That's more than likely where you can find me
I can't undo that, you know that shit was sold when you tried it
This shit crazy, nobody want to put in no work
But want to get paid, though
I'ma keep on spinning on lawyers until the case closed
I'm probably not coming up, not the one you should wait on
I want this shit back, hope it don't take long

Everybody called me with their problems, now they check on me
They said if it happened, then it's me to be, guess we'll see
I know you was lying when you had told me you would never leave
I can't keep on going back and slump, I gotta let it be

(Money, mansion, hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash, yeah
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up
Kept the sticks lit, I'm a factor
I was out there, when it mattered)

// SLIDE //

I just came up in this right hand when I was walkin' into the yard
Slide
And, um, they just opened up, and there's no other way to put it, they just [?], slide down a little, paow, paow, paow
Slide

Made 'em proud but I never made a million
I'm talking net, I heart the set, I'm tryna raise the children
From the Naughty where we ain't pretending
Made a lot of niggas die but I ain't admitting, damn

Ain't forgetting, can't forgive 'em
Preying on 'em, no, it ain't religion
Sick of niggas, no, it ain't remission
With it even though I hate the killings
Rather point it at the crackers, FN with the ladder

Slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide

I love my momma 'cause she did her best
I feel nirvana when I'm in the set
We see who pop it on the internet
Catch one, it's a bet
It's a wrap, hit his lungs if he run
Hit his back, if he crawl hit his hat
Out here living raps

Slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide

Late night, who rides
Grey slides, suits, ties
Slide

// PAPERCUTS //

Bang, cookin' up love, always on the run
Bang, cookin' up love, always on the run

They wanna know if I'm in the street
Or if I still feel a way about the enemies
Just keep it real with me, I don't need no sympathy
I hate this industry, missin' sleep, been some weeks
Countin' money up while they countin' sheep
Used to picture me rollin', vividly
Now everything I dream is everything you see
Ridin' with the blick, thirty shots at least
Keep it in my reach right up on the seat
I try to teach but then these niggas think he tryna preach
And I ain't got no time for nobody out here tryin' me

Ri-ridin' 'round the city, say what's up
Don't be playin' with my money (Don't be playin'), don't be playin' with the hood
Papercuts, papercuts, out here tryna run it up
If it ain't 'bout bread (Yeah), I don't give a fuck (Ayy)
See me 'round the city, say what's up
Don't be playin' with my money (Don't be playin'), don't be playin' with the hood
Papercuts, papercuts, out here tryna run it up (Yeah)
If it ain't 'bout bread, I don't give a fuck, no

We don't wanna hear that bullshit Shareef
Ain't no love, ain't no peace when you broke in these streets
And they never love you back but you don't know until you leave
Always lookin' for a bag, never had the time to grieve
Hit my line, but make it brief if you ain't talkin' dollars
Wild calls from my dawgs, hope the free my partners
Still thinkin' everyday about the one that got away, ayy
You know I'm crazy 'bout you, right?
I want a wife, don't want no baby mama, nah
These crazy bitches try to tap your pockets, yeah
Now I ain't trippin', I'm just bein' honest, yeah
I love my direct deposit

Ri-ridin' 'round the city, say what's up
Don't be playin' with my money (Don't be playin'), don't be playin' with the hood
Papercuts, papercuts, out here tryna run it up
If it ain't 'bout bread (Yeah), I don't give a fuck (Ayy)
See me 'round the city, say what's up
Don't be playin' with my money (Don't be playin'), don't be playin' with the hood
Papercuts, papercuts, out here tryna run it up (Yeah)
If it ain't 'bout bread, I don't give a fuck, no

I'm what you're waitin' for (Yeah, what you waitin' for?)
I'm what you're waitin' for (What you waitin' for? Yeah, what you waitin' for?)
I'm what you're waitin' for (Yeah, what you waitin' for?)
I'm what you're waitin' for (What you waitin' for? Yeah)
Bang, cookin' up love, always on the run
(See me ridin' 'round the city, say what's up
Don't be playin' with my money, don't be playin' with the hood)
Bang, cookin' up love, always on the run

If it ain't 'bout bread)

// LEMONADE //

Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet
Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet (Yeah)

Money talk, broke niggas talk louder (Yeah)
That's why they face so sour
Ain't shit sweet, ask Suga Free (Aye, Suga Free)
Still bust a nigga head, it's the hood in me (Hey)
From the ghetto by the beach, bullets in the breeze
I got million dollar dreams, I got nigga needs
Baby from around the way say she feeling me
Wanna get with me, make the memory
Think she tryna set me up
She sent a late night text saying, "Let's meet up"
No way, I heard you kick it with the enemies (No way)
And if a nigga think I'm slippin then he getting wings

Really with it, so you better be, aye (Yeah)

Feeling like ice cold lemonade

I come from where everybody thirsty (Thirsty)
Got some money now these niggas wanna hurt me (Tell me, why?)
How another nigga getting to it get you mad?
You should go and get some cash 'fore I get you crash

Used to kick it in they hood till we shot it up, aye
It's no friends in the gangland

Pull up on they main block going Rain Man
Money talks, Crips walk, niggas ain't playing
Heavy stepping if I wanna get to Heaven
I'ma have to hit the gate, did too many 211's
Tryna break that bank like ScHoolboy said
Won't stop till the whole hood fed, on my granny's grave (Yeah)

Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet
Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet (Yeah)

// PLAYER WAYS //

Aye, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I buss it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away

I have no time to wine and dine, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothing but a little company
Until the sun is up and that's enough for me

I knew that you would never be mine
I knew that you was just one call away from pressing decline
I knew that time was of the essence, no it never rewinds
You know the press is full of lies so why you pressing your line

I know it eats you up inside to have to tell me the truth
Ain't no way you think I think she love me better than you

You wipe your tears in front the mirror, now you thinking 'bout us

You know who to trust, I'ma be there long as I breathe air

Aye, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I buss it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away

I have no time to wine and dine, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothing but a little company
Until the sun is up, and that's enough for me

I don't know that girl and if I do it's not like that
And if I did, it was a while ago, before you took me back
You always focused on the past, when I be all about that ass
When I be all up in them guts, you know you love to throw it back

You know I live for you and me, I know sometimes it's hard to see
I know I complicated things, I know you scared to say the least
But c'est la vie, estarè aqui
Namaste, nah mean?
These hoes don't mean a thing

Aye, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I buss it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away

I have no time to wine and dine, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothing but a little company
Until the sun is up, and that's enough for me

Catch 'em, I'mma kill 'em, I can bang now
Fuck 'em, won't forgive em, I can bang that, yeah

Put on the set like it's tailored for me
Got in the game and I gave it for free
Shells on the ground 'cause we playing for keeps
If I go down, will you save it for me?

I love the money, she more than a friend

Live by the gun, die by the sand

Find me by the water, I can bang now
All about a dollar, I can bang that, yeah
Ridin' for my partnas, I can bang that
I do what I wanna, I can bang that, yeah
Slidin' with a chopper in a Maybach
If you want a problem nigga say that, yeah
Catch 'em, I'mma kill 'em, I can bang now
Fuck 'em, won't forgive em, I can bang that, yeah

// THE SPIRIT OF MONSTER KODY //

First what they want to know
Did you really write this book?
How could an uneducated motherfucker
Droppin' out the 6th grade
Go to prison?

We have set you up for failure
Period.
You do not breed
Period
You gon' go to prison, juvenile hall, camp, youth authority, prison
You gon' join a prison gang
You're gonna either get stabbed or you're gonna stab people
You're gonna spend the rest of your fuckin' life in solitary confinement

You are finished, Kody Scott

And I said nah
Fuck no!
Hell nah
I ain't finished, yo
Got a spirit of a thug in me
And not just no regular ordinary thug, I'm more like Cinqué
Motherfuckers rebelled against the system

And that's thug shit

// ROSE STREET //

Yeah
I don't sing no love songs, no
I never sang no love songs, no
Yeah, ayy

Baby, how you got that little bitch gettin' you mad
Got some shit you gotta deal with, pimp in my past
Hate the bitch who hit the killswitch when it get bad
Figure skating, takin' field trips, flippin' them racks
On the back street ten times ten on the dash
All gas no brakes 'cause I'm livin' like that
Came up outta every case with my crippin' intact
She be lying to my face so I hit from the back
Let a real nigga know if you a house wife or a ho
Picked the blacker berry, I ain't dealing with this, no
We ain't gettin' married, girl, I'm gettin' to the door
RPGO, yeah

She said she in love, what's that?
Trust, what's that?
Us, what's that? Yeah
I'm married to the gang, don't be playing games
Only bringing flowers to the homie's grave
She said she in love, what's that?
Trust, what's that?
Us, what's that? Yeah
I'm married to the money, don't be playing games
Only bringing flowers to the homie's grave

Red Ferrari seats, all my homies bled out on these streets
Make up on my sheets, make up sex stress, hope she leaves
Reaching for my keys, she like "Where you going? Stay with me"
Hate to see her beg, she don't want me dead
Posted on the block, when it's war, ain't no warning shots
Bullet hit his top, all his homies ran, his body dropped
You can't have my heart but I promise you'll be in my thoughts
We don't go on dates unless I bring what keep me safe
I promise you you don't gotta stress, it's gon' be okay, yeah
Okay I'm lying, living day by day
Just don't waste my time, is you here to stay?
Don't pay attention to the shit you hear 'em say, man
Can't press rewind, life is like the movies, baby
Pray you don't use me, baby
Pray they don't shoot me, baby
Only way you'll lose me I been feeling loopy lately
I keep it on me, I don't use the safety

She said she in love, what's that?
Trust, what's that?
Us, what's that? Yeah (You know the deal)
I'm married to the gang, don't be playing games (Yeah)
Only bringing flowers to the homie's grave (Yeah)
She said she in love, what's that? (Love)
Trust, what's that? (Love)
Us, what's that? Yeah (Yeah)
I'm married to the money, don't be playing games
Only bringing flowers to the homie's grave

What's that? (Dead homies)
What's that? (Dead homies)
(Ayy, ayy, I need y'all to turn this up real quick)
What's that? (Yeah, yeah)
What's that? (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only bringing flowers to the homies' graves
Yeah
I don't sing no love songs, no
I never sang no love songs, no
Long Beach Flowers, what you want?

// THE BLUES //

If I die on the way to give you my love
Please, protect me from the world
Forgive me for what I've done
This shit harder than I make it look, what have I become?
I ain't never been no open book
Money made me numb

Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb

Street life'll trap you
But my daddy wasn't born a pastor
Need greener pastures
Still waitin' on the rapture
I'm never lonely
Even my daydreams is haunted
I keep gettin' smaller houses but I won't find peace 'til the Lord allows it

Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it

What's success but guilt and stress?
Ain't too many niggas had to live with that
Movin' on from what you love
Knowin' you will never get them feelings back
Heart broke but your ego's still intact
Dark soul, been this black
If I reap what I sow, that'd be so astoundin'
No yellow brick road, just public housing
Can you please compose my bail?
It's a hunnid thousand
Know you say you wish me well
But I really doubt it
Who really 'bout it?
Can't wait to see
And if I don't come home tonight
Just pray for me

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
