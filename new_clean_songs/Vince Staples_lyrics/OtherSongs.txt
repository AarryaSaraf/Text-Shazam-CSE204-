// Funk Flex Freestyle #019 //

I'm just a nigga with a black vendetta and a black owned business
And a black Raf with a back and back white privilege
In a big body Benz with the glass black tinted
Kiss my whole black ass if you can't get with it
I'm a whole asshole, nigga, ask Nicole, nigga
Ask Vinyan and my two big sisters
With my big black fist with them blisters in it
From that wood grain whip, but the wheel keep spinnin'
And the world keep turnin', and my Blacks keep burnin'
At the stake, but we still talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
Talkin' 'bout fuckin' hoes, talkin' 'bout what you bang
Talkin' 'bout Crips and Bloods, talkin' 'bout where you from
Talkin' 'bout what you did like somebody give a shit
Do some shit for your home, do some shit for the kids
'Stead of talkin' 'bout yourself, lil' nigga you's a bitch
'Stead of talkin' 'bout yourself, lil' nigga you's a bitch
'Stead of talkin' 'bout yourself, lil' nigga you's a bitch
And I'm straight from 65th, Lil Fade was the name
'Til I growed, only go by the name mama gave
Niggas sweet in the street like they're peach marmalades
See the fuzz, see the judge, then they start to [?]
Tell the police where he live, but won't show your brother love
Lil nigga, you's a bitch
If my black life matters, mothafucka stop the killin
If my black life matters, mothafucka stop snitchin'
If my black life matters, mothafucka start business
In your hood 'stead of lettin' fuckin' Starbucks in it
If my black life matters then respect our women
If my black life matters don't neglect our children
If my black life matters, if the police take my shit with a pistol
Don't march, go kill 'em
Lil nigga, you's a bitch
All these lights, all these drones, what you Star Wars, homes?
In your True Religion jeans and your Star Wars robe
You ain't runway ready, you ain't gunplay ready
God real and he comin', hope you Sunday ready
I never drove one Chevy, I went Bimmer to Mercedes
My mama had a beeper sellin' reefer in the 80s
Levis and A Wang, still from the A gang
Used to be at rallys back when Stormy was my main thing
Had a .22 in the TK Crew fleece
.22 in the TK flew
Had a .22 in the TK Crew fleece
Used to have depression, used to have a couple mood swings
Real shit, now I'm on the bottom of the deal shit
Not here now, a nigga not here now
But guarantee a nigga goin' on, write four rhymes
Every night, on my knees I pray
My next girl look like M.I.A
And my enemies die like Kennedys
We by any means tryna get paid
Niggas in the rap game tryna get slaved
Niggas in this rap game all bitch made
Do it for the fame, I do it for the fans
If rap don't work, I'ma do it with the blam
That trey 5 jam, I'ma do it with my hands
Tears, sweat, blood, I'ma get it out the mud
That's on everything, that's on everything a nigga love
Mothafucka catch a slug tryna buzz on the Norf side
Two guns, tell them niggas hang out
I got two drums like a nigga James Brown
Two guns, tell them niggas hang out
I got two drums like a nigga James Brown
Change the game, watch the game change now
Switched up the gameplan, watch 'em fall down
'Cause lil' nigga, you's a bitch

// Get The Fuck Off My Dick //

Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my car or my crib
Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick
Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my car or my crib
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch
Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick

Yeah, I ain't taking no more calls, might think bout calling it quits
Press is trying to block my blessings, no more talking to Vince
NPR and XXL man I can't tell which is which
Mr. Mark, I think my label need a marketing switch
Hold up, switch the flow up, I won't roll for nothing
Rappers ho up, then they blow up, guess who do the fucking?
VMA and Grammy snubbing
Not walking through no clubs, homie you can keep your money
It don't do nothing for me
Heard they looking for me yeah, you'se a dummy yeah
Have somebody find your body parts, run and run it yeah
Ay bay bay, ain't for play
Steal the steaks, steal the RAF
(And them RAF's is ugly by the way, we see you got money to spend but none the less)

Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch

Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick
Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my car or my crib
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch
Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick

I'm from Ramona, no school diploma
We caught him slipping, he in a coma
You got two choices, lose your life or your persona
I still voices from them nights I hit the corners
Walked through the MoMA
Just did the feature, hit the scene, and blew the quota
I might [?] for the sofa
Might save my Nike check and spend my Coca-Cola
Don't count my packets, pocket [?] and you tow up
Time to glow up from the from up and [?]
You don't know my bank, bitch don't act like you don't know my name
Don't record me man, bitch you see me trying to board this plane
Don't you touch my frame, still the one who bust you in the brain
I don't fuck with fame, you don't see me in no fucking chains
Ain't no fucking slave, Def Jam make 'em put me on no pay
This the sound I made, won't nobody knock me off my wave
I'm the god in this, fuck up off my dick

Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my car or my crib
Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick
Get the fuck off now, get the fuck off my dick
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my car or my crib
Hard to tell which one more perfect, man my art or my bitch
Avant-garde with this shit, get your jaws off my dick

// Get Up //

[Terrell Hines:]
I've been waiting my whole life (Been waiting, still waiting)
Drifting slowly through the night (Been drifting, still drifting)

Feet don't fail me know
Move without a sound
The Shadow of a doubt
We see it from the underground
Feet don't fail me know
Move without a sound
The Shadow of a doubt
We see it from the underground

Coming to ya door bout to take my money
Talk that shit boy you don't mean nothing
Moving with the jackals and hanging with the junkies
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Everybody, everybody, everybody running
Smile to your face but they all want something
Coming to your door bout to take my money
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Get up

[Vince Staples:]
I've been waiting
Too much time, I'm impatient
Pressure rising I might go diamond
Outcasted I might get blasted
Move softly bright lights get off me
Unfortunately, I'm fortunate
Wealth is still disproportionate
Bloodshot eyes behind Porsche tints
Find me on the 91 freeway
Deep thoughts of my life on replay
Pack heat you know fat meat greasy
They say life too short but not easy
I say what I want I'm not P.C
You know black folks killed when police, please
Just seen one on the TV
Make about 3 this week

[Terrell Hines:]
Coming to ya door bout to take my money
Talk that shit boy you don't mean nothing
Moving with the jackals and hanging with the junkies
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Everybody, everybody, everybody, running
Smile to your face but they all want something
Coming to your door bout to take my money
Fuck the government t cause they never gonna love me
Get up

Coming to ya door bout to take my money
Talk that shit boy you don't mean nothing
Moving with the jackals and hanging with the junkies
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Everybody, everybody, everybody, running
Smile to your face but they all want something
Just seen one on the TV
Make about 3 this week

I believe that this whole world is all wretched
I believe the human mind always fooling itself
I believe they wanna keep us wondering what's next
I believe they feed us poison for we won't connect
Rising and running tossing and turning columns are burning
Deja vu or discernment
Sickening makes me vomit
Seems like a broken promise
Vacancy that's atomic
Maybe it's Nostradamus
Maybe this shit is common

Cold in a warm city don't know what to do
They'll poison the flock but you gotta stay true
Trouble in my way yea I might have to cry
I know when I get that Rolex I can't take it when I die
Can't take it when I die
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up

Porsche 911 (Yeah), hat to the back

Can't get close so me gettin' smoke is a long shot, yeah
You know how the team rock (Yeah)
You don't wanna be caught (No)
Growin' up, we fought
Some we've won, some we've lost
Pedal to the metal, won't ease off
Ridin' tryna blow a lil' steam off
Nothin' like the sand and the beach (Like the beach)
Lost a couple friends to the streets (Yeah)

I'ma catch 'em, never stall out, yeah

Where we pull up to the scene, go boom, boom, boom (Yeah)

I'ma catch 'em, never stall out, yeah
Life a blessing (Blessing), so I ball out (Uh-huh, yeah)

// Hell Bound (Ad 01) //

I do it

(Hey turn it up)

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down

Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now baby, come and see me on the Norf of the town
You know I love you, let me cuff you if it's round and it's brown
Grandmama told me keep them homely, hungry citches from 'round
I told her everybody love me, she said, "Not them people, trust me"
She said they just wanna fuck me, she said they just want some money
She said they just want mandingo, don't be giving up my C-Notes
I said these is blue strips
Throw 'em up like a true Crip
Growing up I was too slick
You can't play me 'cause I got the game

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now, hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Okay, now baby, let me see you drop that ass to the ground
Okay, now

Sweet Baby Jesus
Please give me the strength to keep from maxing out my Visas
Lunch at Matsuhisa, no more eating Little Caesars
Pressure life can stress you out when everybody need ya
Love ya but they'll bleed ya
Got it out the hard way, Artesia Boulevard way
Ay, Ramona Park way
Ay, we did it our way
And can do it all day
You see I live for that
Tell him kill that noise before I kill his ass man

Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
Hellbound, it's goin' down
OK now

// Home //

This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion
I'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with the enforcement
Tryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked
Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pay for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
We're not ready yet, waiting for my day of salvation, and I'm patient

Oh, oh, oh...
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home
Oh, oh, oh...
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

They're looking for saviours, I'm looking for safety
They're never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give, do not take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?

Oh, oh, oh...
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home
Oh, oh, oh...
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

Oh, oh, oh...

// Ice Cold (Final Round) //

How dare you walk from me
I'm where I always be
It's all downhill from here

Ice cold you know? (Ice cold)
I go ain't go for broke (I go)
No joke, want smoke
I ain't mad at you though
I've scrap before
I'm strapped, compact
I've clapped before

Who wanna meet they maker?
Who wanna meet they savior?
I'm in a big house now
Who never seen they neighbors?
Who wanna see my greatness?
Best believe I'm pay-per-view
Best believe I'm made for feuds
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous

Who wanna meet they maker?
Who wanna meet they savior?
Who wanna see my greatness?

Best believe I'm Pay-per-view
Rest believe I'm made for feuds
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous
This for the rich and famous
This for the broke and basic
Better stay out my way
I want it, I take it
I'm on it, I'm jaded
I'm more than amazing
I'm scoring, so who keepin' count here?
Just don't count me out here, you know?

// L.A. Leakers - Freestyle #114 //

Yeah, plant the seed for the [?] ignore the politics
Problematic proud of it, automatic shot the whip
Dropping shells from out of that window I felt like Common Sense
Promise I did more for my niggas than them Obamas did
Late-night stepping like Thriller you niggas dead to me
Tagging 7th Street, they scrubbed it off the wall like every week
Famous city by the sea, the streets was cold I felt the breeze
I rose from out the ruins broke the mold and they neglected me
Hitting licks them crackers cracked the whip when they arrested me
[?] phase I'm doing okay, this the story of O.J
Black against the white I had to steal nigga
My blood introduced me to this Cripping, I'm for real with' it
If I was you and I was thinking I was next up out the Beach I wouldn't hold my breath unless you Navy SEAL with' it
'Fore we go to war, you should take up propaganda
See my money from Gardena to Gardere, Louisiana
We was at Louisiana, came up off them snack packs
50 cent for Shastas, itchy blop up in the backpack
Little Caesar Hot-N-Ready box we had to have that
Made us heavy hitters off the block I'm talking crack-backs
Niggas say I fell off, that's facts
I guess you can say I fell off of the grid, you like the Netherlands?
Football match in Madrid, this not the Meadowlands
These lil' niggas punch in the air, and still they never land
It's like they writing with Geppetto hands
If you see yo' [?] in a jam can you help the man?
Feel like De La ghetto with' the Prince cannon and the can
Pressure lowers karma leave no rent due, you understand?
We spun around his block he did the Running Man
Shawty did the Lil' Kim, missed him but we hit his friend
Listening to Many Men, living out my favorite song
They killed my lil' homie 'fore he got to see his baby grown
And y'all wanna talk about practice?
Them suckers down the street get gunned up and clapped quick
The suckers by the Beach get gunned up and clapped quick
Run and point that.32 and make 'em sicker than Magic, voilà
If I ever tap the side of his hat, it's trauma
You will never catch me slipping in traffic
How you coming?
Who put you on this, you just claim it or you from it?
These niggas out here blowing brains y'all blowing budgets
Rappers make me sick to my stomach, we glorify who died and demonize the niggas who done it
I thought we was thugging, niggas killed Jabari for nothing
I thought we was thugging, niggas killed Jabari for nothing
I thought we was thugging, niggas killed Jabari for nothing
Come on, I thought we was thugging, niggas killed Jabari for nothing
Think I'm finna mourn a nigga over bars then you bugging
That's the real but can you recognize the revolution won't be televised
And people had me slaving, left me hanging 'til we severed ties
I was better suited for the shoot a noodle [?] realized
So I don't need yo' praises I don't need appraisal for my shine
Real diamond out the rough, you niggas in the lab
I heard y'all out here cooking up, them crackers in y'all bag
You say my name up in a song and I'ma kill yo' ass
And I ain't talking rap
North

// Opps //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Fuck y'all want from me
Y'all don't own money
Y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and break the thing
Trapped inside a burning church
Made it out alive
God know my worth
Raw face, scarface, your face
More defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em
20 on call
Got 20 in my hand
Got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog
Got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you to fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (you're dead to me)
[*censored*] takes all (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in... (you're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

[Vince Staples:]
Hey hey
Ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
Life hit a nigga with a lemon's lime
Like what at night we still committing crimes, spitting rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinning rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleeding hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a city wide bend
Show no pity in the city for the sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimming in the debt
Don't drown on ground wait until you hear
911, freeze (zoom zoom) dead

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (you're dead to me)

Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

[Yugen Blakrok:]
I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouth piece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham city streets I'll blame the [*censored*]
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colours in my aura tend cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-rez lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Roll over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my chords like a weaver

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)

So, if I was you, I would know it's no way possible
[?] greatest DJ in the world
Come grab your beat
Cause' if he hand it to me
It's not yours no more

They be like stupid, where you been at?
We ain't seen you in weeks
Yeah, I been tryna' catch a body off of John and em' streets
They went and killed my lil' homie so I'm back on the east
Catch him on Anaheim and stash his mind in back of the seat
They call me stupid 'cause I shoot it, I don't think I don't blink
I been with' it since Xzibit used to P-I-M-P
You ain't down to keep it silent, you ain't down to catch a body
Boy, I hopped up off the porch banging norf illuminati
When I hop up out the four-door, don't you touch my body
This is undercover brother I am not in no Givenchy
Know you know it but I gotta say it baby, I'm from Poppy
If you hold it then you gotta spray it, baby don't be sloppy
If I catch you with your four hoe, we killin' everybody
Kill your pappy, kill your mommy, kill your second-cousin Connie
And my crime be stomp and fade
Boosie in the trunk with face
But if they interroga-ting, I don't know nobody
I ain't with the business
This is just an image
I ain't hurt nobody
I don't know who did it
Buster sending [?] harboring the snitches
Enemies stalking me harder than the [?]
Ended up a martyr on what started as a mission
Shot him where he used to hold his daughter in his pictures
Now his momma talkin' bout
"Somebody know who did it, my baby ain't deserve it"
She crying at the service
In the streets in triple [?] and stealing jeans from mervyns
Trigger squeezers, split the scene
I iced them with the Gervin
Finger roll, we seen them toll
He said it ain't on purpose
Now we up in medical they askin why he said it cold
Better know I never change
Runnin with these yanks
Poppy block
Down the 65th, down the 68th
Want a shot, you will never get
But we came to play
And free killer cash from the A

Lotta' y'all can't rap no more
I feel like I'm one of the greatest ever
You know since day one we probably never ever heard this...
I feel like [?] one of the greatest ever
... comin your way you know, look
Wake up wipe the

// Sizzurp //

My father said women only listen when you hit 'em
Gun to my momma head, sitting in the kitchen
I'm sorry I ain't the perfect kinda nigga
I tried to fix it, but nobody listened so I'm chillin'
My only dream is that I die before I make a million
Either that or take a L for dealing cause I'm trapped out
Tryna build a castle from the crack house
Running out of rocks so I'm stuck to the stones, they've thrown at me
Nine times out of the ten I'm not happy
9th grade dreaming of Benz's that we'll never get
Banging for the hell of it, did it cause we wasn't scared to die
Just afraid to grow up and be something

They gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga

I guess y'all fucked with the wrong nigga
Ex girls hating on me, police bangin' on me
See they just a bigger gang, but that shit's a different story
Living on the highest story, hoping I don't fall too hard
Saying "Yo, don't ball too hard", selling dope is not a job
Is what I tell myself everyday, but it's hard to stop
Kinda like I'm using, making use of all this time I bought
The rounds you fought were rounds I shot
See the police coming, run around the block
Ain't no need for court, we black so we already lost
Power to the people, seven rounds up in this eagle
Birds baths for your bitch ass

But they gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga
Yeah they gon' love you when you gone nigga
Nigga

I bring pain, watch my.45 flame
Drive-by's, while I ghostride Cam'ron's range
Bang like Jerome Lane, 3 or 4 K's, and a Kevlar underneath the 'Lo Chambray
Niggas gon' try me, I'ma blast they brains
Shotty's all I need, Cobain, coldchain
What's rap these days? Niggas running with the police
We gunning with the police, Daytons on the gold jeep
Ride solo, cause nigga's known to squeal
Up in that glass room, singing like soul for real
Still, I made a promise to my momma that I'd never go to jail
So a nigga won't, burning shells, 'til I burn in hell
Had to double up my personnel for the clientele
Nigga's want it coming off the scales and need the sales
Pack a zip and ship it in the mail like report cards
And they said we wasn't gon' go far, yeah right

But they gon' love you when you gone nigga, right?

// XXL Freshman 2015 - Vince Staples Freestyle //

I apologize If I might be the reason that your son never made it back home
He should have gave up the phone
Armed robberies at Mayfair Park
Met every nigga that I got with me at Mayfair Park
The comraderies, I build is with niggas that will kill
Life start sheddin' tears and it's all downhill
I put my homies in the dirt, and the scars ain't heal
But my eyes stay dry, tecs pour out shells
Piss poor on the wic like "fuck it, I'm a crip"
Cause a blue collar nigga get treated like shit
Quite ironic, quiet on the set
Listen to the violence I encounter ridin' for the set
Followin' the guidance of the people penniless
Just another piece of shit
That the preachers wasn't reachin' with the speeches from the pit
Lookin' who we pit against, crime black on black
The police pull up, clap and wet our backs, till we laid out flat
And nobody care the next day, I guess it's no fair play
You see my big bro Pac so that means I'm strapped
North Side, NY on my baseball cap
Raised as a have not had plots on a fortune
Reduced lunch, had a nigga feelin' less important
Rich man in Porsches, broke moms on bus stops
Livin' with emotion, look what the love got
Sittin' in a church, givin' her last dollar
Prayer wasn't the answer, they was answered with "nada"
See my heavenly father no better
Than the one that put his dick in my mama
Long chedda was a dream
We was government cheesin' in 'em mugshots
Long as these niggas fiend for what the plug got
We gon' make our money with greedings on the side walk
Through car windows is tryna get the gig off
Knock a nigga wig off for actin' like a bitch
Keep a seven in the dresser and a mac up in the whip
Case they try to catch me slip-in'

// Yo Love //

[Mereba:]
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I-I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I

[Vince Staples:]
Look alive, life too short, might as well build a rapport
Speakin' 'bout me and you, since they got me off the porch
I been beaten black and blue
Story of my life, tell me something' about you
Where you from? Did you stay or did you run?
You ever thought about a daughter or a son? No
You lookin' for a Jason Lyric or a Love Jones
I know you prolly sick of love songs, but

[6LACK & Mereba:]
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love

[Vince Staples:]
I still remember when we used to all pretend
Afraid to be in love, afraid to just be friends
I still remember when you used to call me up
Was broken-hearted, young, that nigga dogged you, huh?
Baby, don't hold no grudge, you know I hold you down
And if they ever try, I got a hundred rounds
Until the day we die, and then we in the sky
Forever loyal in the moment, or immortal

[6LACK & Mereba:]
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love

[6LACK:]
She my forever thing, baby, you more than great
I never say a word, it's first forty-eight
Look I remember when we started poppin', yeah
You stole my eye, I stole your heart down at the county fair
Now if worst come to worst, I left a note in your purse
Remember me from this verse, I'm turnin' myself in
I can't pretend we both goin' down the road
I need you to have my seed, set the legacy in stone

[6LACK & Mereba:]
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love
