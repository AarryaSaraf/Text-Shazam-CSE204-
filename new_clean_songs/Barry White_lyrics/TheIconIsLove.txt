// Super Lover //

Super lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I would be a liar if I said I couldn't get higher
Than your love, than your love
Just that I'm under your power
Hour after hour from your love
Yes I am
Smooth sexy lady I like what you make me with your love
I need your love
With your supervision I know you won't agree
Your super lover's vision has took control of me
A super love connection is the only key
It takes a super lady to have a super guy like me
Super lover super woman
You really got me comin' off the ground I'm bound
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around (yea I can, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I can feel the fire, you fill me with desire
With your love, I want your love
Oooh you hypnotize me, the way you mesmerize me
With your love, give me your love
Burning lips of fire there's another risk
Touching is a part of you slow
Super love sensation, makes my body wet
I get so intensified and I can't let go
Super lover super woman
You just keep lifting my heart off the ground I'm bound

I'm really bound
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around
Super lover super woman
You really got me comin' off the ground really I'm off the ground
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around
Super lover, yeah there is no other
Super woman, keep me comin'
Super lover, ain't no other
Here it comes [?]

Super lover, you got me covered
Super lover, girl there is no other
No, no, no, no,
I don't want no other.

// Practice What You Preach //

So, what do you want to do, I'm here baby
I'm ready baby, I'm waiting on you
Believe me, I am patiently, 
Waiting, 
On you

Girl there's something wrong with me
Every time I'm alone with you
You keep talking 'bout you loving me
Hey babe, your foreplay just blows my mind
So why don't we stop all the talking girl
Why don't we stop wasting time?

I've had, my share of love 
And some say I'm damn good
But if you think, you can turn me out
Baby I wish that you would

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

(I'm telling you this, I'm telling you that
'Cause once I've been with you, you'll never go back
There is a lesson that I'm gonna teach)
Here I am baby, practice, what you preach

Girl it's just you and me, so many things 
I could do to you and so many ways I can please
Hey, hey, hey it's your move (girl)
Why don't you start turning down the lights
And show me what you can do?

Well I've had my share of lovers
Some of them are damn good
But if you think, you can turn me out
Girl I just wish that you would
'Cause you keep,
Oh you just keep,
Naw, you just keep

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Ladies, baby, baby, baby
We're wasting time, precious time
All this talk about what you're gonna do
And how you're gonna do it to me
Come on, practice what you preach

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

// There It Is //

Don't say anything, don't say one word
Just listen to me, just lay there
And let me unwind a little
Sing like today would never end

This is so nice, it really feels so good
I love to play all up in your hair
Let me touch you and rub you all over
And just lay down

I'm starting to feel something, it's
It's really intensifying my body
Makes me wanna do all kinds of things
To you

Hey there, how you're doing?
Baby, I'm so glad to be home
You know just what I need, babe
So turn off the phone, stop the TV
I only want you

And it's time now to do it
Let's start in the shower
It's gonna take hours
Before we're through

All day I've been waiting
For the first chance
That I could get my hands
All over you

So don't move, stay right there
There it is, there it is
Don't you go, don't you move
Keep it right there
There it is, there it is

Let me undo your hair
Let me undress you
From your clothes
To your underwear

I'm gonna love you
Love you gently, all night
I know all your secrets
Girl, I know what you like

So just lay there and let me
Make you shiver and shake
Till you scream and say
Baby, I can't take no more

Don't you move, stay right there
There it is, there it is
Don't move, baby

Don't you move, keep it right there
There it is, there it is
Don't you move, stay there
There it is, there it is

I wanna lick you, baby
Kiss you, love you, touch you, babe
Girl, I'm your fantasy

I love it wet, girl, make me sweat
Until I get off, babe
It feels so good, give it all to me

Give me your hair braid
Every bit of you
Let's go slowly, a bit easy

I want this to last tonight
It's gonna be good tonight
Work it

Don't move, work it, stay right there
There it is, there it is
Oh, just don't move, keep it right there
There it is, there it is, baby, baby, baby

Don't move, stay right there, please
There it is, there it is
Don't move, keep it right there
There it is, there it is

Don't you move, stay right there
There it is, there it is
Don't move

// I Only Want To Be With You //

I know what I want, baby, I know what I like
You're the one, you're my choice for life
You, every, every bit of you, I want it all, all of you

I want your love so bad, it makes my nature ache
Oh, let me share with you whatever love it takes
I'll be your fruit, between your sheets, is what you do to me, yeah

I'll be inside of you as long as you want me in it

Whatever you want, whatever you say

I'll be inside of you as long as you want me in it

Yeah, well, I only want to be with you

// Don't You Want To Know //

You know my feelings for you
Are getting stronger and stronger everyday
And I'm learning more and more and more about you everyday
And there's area we need to address
Mentally, physically, and romantically
Immediately

Tell me, show me
All the little sensitive places
That make you feel
The way you love to feel
Baby I want to please you tonight
Baby I really need you tonight

Don't you want to know
Girl if we can fill the nights with love
Don't you want to know
If it's better than it's ever been before, yeah, yeah

We've been together
Now for quite some time
When you gonna let me make love to you
Baby it's so obvious
We're like two of a kind
We just wanna make sure we're right

Don't you want to know
If we can fill the nights with love
I do baby
Don't you want to know
If what we feel is really real or no

// Whatever We Had, We Had //

As the world turns from day to day
As we live we have to make decisions
And when we make those decisions
Things don't always turn out the way
We'd like them to or want them to
No matter what we feel or what seems real things change
We don't have a crystal ball to look into
To know what our future is going to be
Or what it gonna be
You meet someone
You care for that someone, you love that one
We made plans, we planned for so many things but
Life has always been that way
So you must understand how I feel when I say we had our run
Good times, sad times, the fun times, the bad times
We should always remember
That we started as friends& there's no reason
We shouldn't end as friends
So whatever we had, we had

Whatever we had, we had
Whatever we had it's over, over now
We parted as friends
And for that I'm so glad
But whatever we had, we had

You know time has played a very important role on our relationship
It was time that first brought us together and
It's time that we separate and leave each other
No matter what you might think, parting is always sweet sorrow
But whatever we had, we had

Whenever we loved, we loved
Whatever it was, it's over, over now
We both understand things don't
Always fall the way we plan

You know we did a lot of things in those years
We felt a lot of pain through tears
But there's something that we did that I'll always, always be thankful for
Together we created a very very special life and that's why I'm
Saying to you... Whatever we had, we had
But whatever we had, we had

And I know that we'll both be right
As long as we live life to its fullest
Because it doesn't really matter now
Who's right or who was wrong
Just live, be happy
You'll find someone, somewhere
Believe me, please believe me

We could have worked harder
But who knows
We went as far as we could go
But whatever we had, we had
We'll always be friends
And for that I'm so glad
But whatever we had, we had

Gone are the days
They seem so many years away...
But whatever we had, we had
Oh no baby
