// Staying Power //

I'm not going nowhere
I'm staying baby I'm staying
You know why?
I've got staying power
Baby, I've made plans
In a fancy restaurant where we can dance
Put on my favorite dress
You know the one
That oozes sexiness
Tonight when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my tongue
Oh baby, my missions clear
There's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 

Slow down, don't heat so fast
Anticipation makes a good thing last
Tease me with your emotions
Soon we'll share nature's body lotion
Are you ready to free
Girl you know you got just what I need
Oh baby, my missions clear
It's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 

No, no baby I'm not going anywhere 
No no no I'm not going anywhere
I'll be here 
Ill be here
For years and years

Tonight when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my tongue
Oh baby my missions clear
There's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think its over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over 
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over

// Don't Play Games //

All I wanna do is to always be there for you
To love you, need you and keep you
Baby that's all I wanna do

Don't play games, trying to be quick (never)
and trying to be slick (ever)
Don't play games, aw it makes a mess
And all you get is pain

Baby we can do this, baby we should try
So let's jump right in to it
Let's make that move tonight
No don't play games, tryin' to be sly
It's not smart, it's not wise  

No don't play games, it makes a mess
And all you get is pain
Now it's gonna be a challenge
Love is so unique, yeah
It all hangs in the balance 
And girl we hold the key

I know we can do this
Baby we should try
Now let's jump right into it
Let's make that move 
Let's make that move tonight

No don't play games, trying to be quick
And tryin' to be slick
No don't play games, tryin' to be sly
It's not smart, it's not wise,
Don't play games, it makes a mess 
And all you get is pain
Don't play games, tryin' sly 
It's not smart, it's not wise

Don't play games, don't do it baby
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it babe
Don't do it, don't do it, no don't do it
No don't do it, don't do it babe
Don't do it babe, no don't do it babe
Don't play games, no don't play games
Baby don't play games, no don't play games
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it

// The Longer We Make Love //

Don't think...just feel it
Ooooh...just do it

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

Anytime is the right time 
To share your love with me
And baby, in the meantime
I'll be waiting anciously

I'm in the mood to make sweet love to you
It's always on my mind, babe
All of the things you love me to do
I'm gonna make it nice, I'm gonna make it right

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be

I love the way you freak me

I'm in the same situation
I need you more and more each day
Seems when you're not around me
Oh, so very far away
And I'm in the mood to give sweet love to you
Girl, that's always on my mind
And all the things you want me to do
Turn out the light, I'll make it right

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The longer we do it, the more we get down to it

I'm in the mood to make sweet love to you
It's always on my mind, babe
All of the things you love me to do
I'm gonna make it nice, I'm gonna make it right

I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

The longer we make love
The closer I want to be
I just can't get enough
I love the way you freak me

// I Get Off On You //

You are different
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder, baby
And to me you're different as night and day
From all the rest

There's not a lot of things that
That can excite me, ignite me
You're all that and then so

Your lips, your smile, can I reminisce just for a while?
Your eyes, your hair, everything I love, you got it right there
Your soft tone when you speak
Your sexiness down to your feet

Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Do you get off on me?

Your tenderness
And gentle ways
Love it when you sigh
Make love to me

And you're the one, my wildest dream
Someone like you is all I need
But many things that you posses
Girl, your out front from all the rest

Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Do you get off on me?

First of all you're sensitive, very sensitive
And I love that in a woman
You love flowers, you're so cute, so precious to me
Very precious to me

Step, baby, step
Yeah, you're there
You're walk, your talk
Have mercy, mercy on me

Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you

Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
Do you get off on me?

Baby, baby, baby
I get off on you
I do, I do

// Which Way Is Up //

Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no
I don't know, I don't know
C'mon turn around
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
The world is moving much too fast
Enjoy the good things and make them last
Each day there's something new to learn
Everyday is a new way for what you learn
I've gotta make money, I've got to live
I'm not complainin', that's just the way it is
A ball and chain around my neck
The more I dig out, the deeper I get
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no
C'mon turn around, people
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no
C'mon turn around
Got a whole new outlook on life itself
I'm gonna make it, won't settle for nothin' else
It's up to me to achieve it
And I know I will 'coz I believe it
The more I know, the more I'll grow
Knowledge is key and I wanna flow
This ball and chain is comin' off my neck
I'm gonna pick this ball and chain
I'm gonna put it in check
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no
C'mon turn around, help me
Which way is up, which way is up?
Which way is up? That way
Which way is up?
Which way?
Which way?
Which way? That way
Which way? That way
Which way? That way

// Sometimes //

Life is a game, it's a
And the only way you can participate in it
Is you have to get involved
With all your heart and soul
Your mind, oh, your mind
Is such a great thing, use it, use it
The positive has to overtake the negative
And no matter what people may say to you
Believe me, you have to get involved
In the game of life
Things don't always go the way you want 'em to
But hang in there
Don't be afraid, no matter what they say
You gotta take a chance at life
And you don't know how far you can go
And you won't know until you try
Set your sights for better things in life
And work for them hard as you can
Patience is key, it always sets you free
It's all about your master plan
People, sometimes
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes some things are so hard to do
Make your move, be careful what you chose
You gonna reap what you sow
Make no mistake, you've got what it takes
And all it's gonna take is you
Patience is key, it always sets you free
And you can make it if you try
Don't waste time makin' up your mind
It's your choice, it's your life
Listen to me, people
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
They say that the mind
Is a terrible, terrible thing to waste
And so it's time, and it's time
That you made up your mind
About what you wanna do in life
Different strokes for different folks
We're all in this together
And what you have to realize is that
You can't always win and you can't always lose
Just sometimes, sometimes you do
Listen to me, people
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes some things are so hard to do
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
