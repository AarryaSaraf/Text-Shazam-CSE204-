// Small Bump //

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

Oh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

// ...Baby One More Time //

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

// 2step (Brazilian Remix) //

[Ed Sheeran:]
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

[Chefin:]
(Chefin)
Uma Lamborghini preta, você vem?
Ou quer andar na minha Mercedes-Benz?
Eu sou tão novo enriquecendo os bem
Olha o relógio, tem o Rolex, te dei
Pisando fofo, tenho um Jordan que é tão raro
E tu olha pra quem? (Chefin)
Eu fui de cara no teu colo
E tu me fez refém (Prr, prr; ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn)
Agora olha a madrugada, vem
Não é a mesma longe de você
Olhando o tempo, eu pude perceber
Que algumas coisa' tem que se esquecer
'Tava bolando umas coisa', pensando em um futuro
Mandei mensagem pra saber de tudo (Ahn, ahn)
Só que no fundo, isso dava um duro (Oh)
Pra poder explicar tudo (Ah)
Que você tinha através da passagem (Oh, oh)
Pedindo um trocado pra ficar na party (Ah)
Vou continuar (Ah, ah, pow, pow, pow, pow)

[Ed Sheeran (Chefin):]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Prr)

We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (Ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn-ahn)
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time (Yeah, ayy)
But we know what it feels to be low then up (Oh, oh), alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (Ayy)

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night (Two-step)
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (Two-step)
Night, yeah (Oh, oh)
All we need is us to go all night (Two-step)

All we need is us

Mä pakenin mun ongelmii
Viikonloppuihi ja sumusii tunnelmii
Ylianalyyttine ja ahdistukseen taipuvaine
Jonku mielestä vaa onnekas paskiaine
Mut ne ei tiiä kaikkee, yeah
Muista et menestys ja menetys kulkee käsikädes
Kohtalohan ei koskaa erehdy
Ja ihan sama mitä teet
Aina joku dumaa
Sä voit rakastaa tai vihaa mua
Mä teen silti musaa

Todellisuus hämärtyy
Taas yks uneton yö, mut mulla on syy
Muuki ku tää kakskytneljä-seiska työ
Sä oot siinä, sun kanssa pysyy kirkkaana mun pää
Kenenkään muun kaa en haluu elää tätä elämää

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love

We'll keep turnin' up and go all night

Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

[Leto:]
Elle me donne beaucoup plus de love depuis qu'j'suis dans le top stream (Love)
Je souris plus trop car mes émotions se supplient (Car mes émotions se supplient)
C'est vrai qu'j'ai beaucoup d'choses à perdre mais c'est tout pour la gagne
Que le bon Dieu me pardonne
Oh no (Mmh), ça fait qu'empirer ('pirer)
Toute une famille qui sèche ses larmes devant les huissiers (Oh no)
Grandi là où c'est chaud mais j'ai soigné mes bobos en encaissant du seille-o
On cache nos faiblesses pour pas finir manipuler
R.I.P aux soldats qu'on a perdu en cours de route (R.I.P aux soldats)
Constamment donner de l'amour

All we need is love
Doch liebe fällt so schwer bei den Problemen in mein' Kopf (Kopf)
PTSD hält mich wach am Block
Mein Herz ist 26, meine Seele 52 (Yeah)
Ich weiß, nicht alles, was ich mache, ist vernünftig (No)
Du warst so wie Weed, wir kannten uns nur flüchtig
Doch dann wurd ich süchtig, seitdem trägt das ganze Früchte
Mit dir halt' ich es einhundert, weil du warst immer echt (Real)
Ich hab' hundert K in Duffle-Bag (Bag)
Sie gibt mir ein'n Haargummi, ich pack's um die Racks
Ich weiß, spar'n wär nicht schlecht, doch

We'll go all night

We'll keep turnin' up and go all night

Baatein muhe kuch hain kehni
Roka khudko hai maine kayi baar, ab lagta hai bol doon
Jinko bhi hai ghalat fehmi, chalo unki bhi aankein, ab main khol doom
Jo bhi main hoon, mere dum pe
Haath rakha na kisine mere aar pe
Jeete dil maine kaam se
Jud gaye hazaaron lakhoon fans, mere nam se
Dil se jo gaye maine geet to hataaya mujhe unse
Umar mein hoon chota, thak gaya tha sun sun ke
Chal jaane de na yaar, muhe mil gaya tera pyaar

Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

Slow down when I can't feel myself
Looking right but knowing that there's nothing left
So slow wine for the sour grapes
'Cause moving on isn't up for debate

I still wonder where the time's gone (Am I wrong?)
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong (They alarm)
With all these expectations of what I should be
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me

Even when I'm struggling
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function
It's wahala but mahalo
Got my two-step, so the beat's the only thing I have to follow, uh

We'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all (Night)

Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te, però
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos'è
Vorrei sparire di botto, come la pioggia d'agosto
Poi dimostrarti che torno, in fondo l'amore è ritorno, però

Siediti, che ti racconto come si può nella
Vita stare in piedi senza che nessuno
Paghi per te il conto ed essere oggi quel che
Tu sognavi ieri, come ho fatto a non vederlo

Nei miei occhi che ho già dentro quel che
Io cercavo fuori, dai, sarà che
C'ho il destino in tasca e lo decido io
Se un giorno questo cambia

We'll go all night

All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes

Night, yeah
And all we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words and weapons, and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me

I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best
And the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn

Cuz, Cuz, Cuz, Cuz, teddyphotos

Känns som hennes hjärta sitter åt höger
Och när hon kommer, vet exakt vad hon söker
Jag behöver ingen stress
Kallar hellre henne ex
Mannen fuck alla ex
Hon vet jag älskar hela orten för mycket mannen
2Step'en med dendära favorittabben
Älskar 180 lukten lika mycket som 450'n i luften
Finns en grej med tugget

Is like a bad dream
I thought that me you was to meant to see the seven seas
Why would you let somebody between us
Now I got many reasons for it not to be us
E-E-E-Every time dark now rises you my sunshine
'Tell me what goes up that doesn't go down
We're supposed to go up which is to cold now
Watch you can play me, yeah, you're crazy, oh
But love is a different type of drug
You made a gangster fall in love
[?] fucking believe me
Now you [?] to see me

[Ed Sheeran:]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

// 2step (UK Remix) //

I know I promised you the world when I didn't have it
You say I'm a liar, I don't care but that's a bit dramatic
You know I've got enough stress, I'm living post-traumatic
I know we're bigger than a picture or a silly caption
I like you in real life, I'm bending over backwards
And love the way you love me, I find you so attractive
Flight mode, we don't need no distractions
And we ain't walking down the street unless you hold my handgun
Maybe I'm just a schmuck who really can't believe his luck
But he's just hoping he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard
So we learned to adjust and take the smooth with the rough
Your skin smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup
She know I ain't like them fools in the club
I'm grinding so we got a house on the hill
A boat for the [?] and a pool [?]
Till then I'm two-stepping in the mud

We'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing
When I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels
To be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come
When I feel the dark, and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest
Are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays

We'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing
When I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels
To be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

// 2step (Ukrainian Remix) //

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

Сирени обірвали наш сон
У дві валізи все минуле
Далі go go
Ти за кермом у невідоме
І всі нерви в кулак
І не рви мене так
Я залишаюся вдихати дим

Останній запах і Dior із ним
Я пам'ятаю, ти хотіла в Рим
Все йде до того, що спочатку на Крим
Ми свій двіж замутим
Ніхто не вийде із води сухим

Нас застав напряжний ранок як серіал-драма
Місяцями героï ми тут, і ми тут шоураннери
Горить сюжет, скільки ще ракет
Мила, обіцяю, коли все мине

Я танцюватиму з тобою so slow
І цілуватиму туди, де любов
Знов і знов
Чекай мене, коли все це мине
Я впаду з тобою в цей flow
Зацілую туди, де любов
Знов і знов
Чекай мене, коли все це мине

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

// Bad Habits (Fumez The Engineer Remix) //

Ooh
You know a lot of people ask us
"How is C-Dot funded?
And where do you get your money from?"
The simple answer

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
(Grr, mm-mm, yeah)

Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Girl up on my left side, girl up on my right (Mm-mm)
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Bow, bow, bow)
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Before the music, had to put a shift in
Made Lambo money from a Citröen (Boom)
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in the system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my veins)
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom)
Bad habits, can't end up with case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi, go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy)
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad)
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're having flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck (Ooh), he got brucked up (Ooh)
In my drop-top (Ooh), getting top-top (Boom)
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
'Nother boy eating, bidda-bop-bop (Boom)
But fuck what you're telling them, I'm from Edmonton
Bad vibes everything
Rolex or I might bust my skeleton (Buh, buh, buh)
(My bad habits lead to you)

I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say something I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap on
Messed up with my good girl, on a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin' out, takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ay, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body in tight, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up

I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr)
Bad sight weh me keep up the fuckery (Bow)
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm)
Bad time, but today I'm lucky
Yo, in the rear with the gauge (Bow)
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom)
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Mm, mm)
She left me on read back then when I had no bread
Like shorty didn't trust the process
Free all the guys locked down four walls
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it
But you gotta do what you gotta do
And you're stuck in the hood just hopin'
I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left is an artist
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the rhaatid
Think I won't pull up and bark it
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic
Yay come white like yam, it ain't powdered
Looking for cribs, just fully detached
I came from council housing
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask for a chance
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password
When it's really on, when's he gonna clart it off?
No fears cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is
Always aim at the target market
Look at the profit margin

I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

Fumez The Engineer
If bro calls me and say it's time, I don't care
I'm putting my ca-, I'm putting my career on hold
But why everyone, but why everyone
But why everyone there when you blow?

// Bad Habits (MEDUZA Remix) //

Yeah

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we

We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we

// Candle In The Wind (2018 Version) //

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

// Castle On The Hill (Acoustic) //

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down

I was younger then
Take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon I did it right

But I was younger then
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs and when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

// Celestial //

You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again

I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're going down
And I know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial

You see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in the brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray

When I get lost will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're going down
Know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, ohh

We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on

You make me feel
(We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(When we notice that's what really matters is)
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh

We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
Celestial

// Chasing Cars //

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need 
Anything
Or anyone
So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

So if I lay here
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world

// Coco (Hitimpulse Remix) //

I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...

Hit my plug, that's my cholo
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco 
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
50 deep, they're like, "oh, no"
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the popo

I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...

36, that's a kilo 
Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O 
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O 
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, I'm like Nemo

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga

I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...

// Diary //

Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in it's cereal
And running ten miles a day.
And your love has a driving ban,
For trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands,
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight

If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love,
And that's why

I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words.
And I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words.

And your love,
Has never been my enemy.
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave.
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody.
And your love,
Told me it was going to a different page.
And you know, if I let you go,
I'll still keep you safe.

If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why

I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words.
And I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words.

You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you

Diary
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words.
And I could be your diary,
Baby if you open me up.
Keep it inside me,
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words.
Yeah

// Don't / Loyal / No Diggity / The Next Episode / Nina //

I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

(knock, knock, knock)
on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

these girls ain't loyal
that heart is soo cold
this girl ain't loyal

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10,
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up girl)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up

Top Dogg, bite em all, nigga burn the shit up
D-P-G-C my nigga turn that shit up
C-P-T, L-B-C, yeah we hookin back up
And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug niggaz drug dealers yeah they givin it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

La-da-da-da-dahh
It's the motherfuckin D.R.E. (snoop doooooog)
La-da-da-da-dahhh
You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G

eyo eyo eyo eyoooooo

But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the barb with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
Now

// Drunk In Love //

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor's in me baby
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded, faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love
I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

There we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything's all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy I'm drinking
Brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out
He sweat it out, I wear that
Boy I'm drinking
I'm on the mic till my voice horse
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then I ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, grain, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that
Swerve swerving on that big body
Just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

Now we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I don't know much about love but I know I've been shot by you
And I don't know much about algebra but I know one plus one is two
Cause we ain't got nothing but love
Babe you got enough for both of us

Cause we be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

// Eraser (Extended F64 Version) //

I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind

So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become

Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well

And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans

Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner

I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue,
And wish that I had known what to do as a younging
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh

And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you"

I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for

And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Well, yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us

Usin' my balance on eraser blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke," no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign

Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men

And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit

I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Sat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish

// Everything You Are //

I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight

I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same, again and again and again
I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

Oh I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

When I see my future
It is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you
We'll get there

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want
Behind my truth lies everything you want
Behind my truth lies everything you are

// F64 //

Yo Jam, this is a letter to you
It's been a while, but it's been hard for me to get in the booth
Since we last spoke, I've become a father of two
Trying to live life with a smile but that's been harder to do
'Cause all I wanna do is talk about you
But these tears won't let me talk about you
We should've known that we'd be lost without you
Therapy sessions, digging deep in depression
I got a life full of blessings, but this just breaks my fucking heart
At your birthday, couldn't even crack a smile
I just cried and left the party, Neesh, I'll see you in a while
Headed to the mural, got some jerk wings and plantain
'Cause that is the way that me and you would celebrate it
I never knew you touched the stuff, 'cause you'd always bad me up
You saw me more than drunk, you always hated what it does
Before Lyra I just stopped, I haven't even wanted one
I can't get over, this is fucked, man I wished I'd known
And yo, we cried for nine nights in your family home
Laid you to rest in the ground but without a stone
You know it hits me most at moments, now when I'm alone
Every morning, I remember that you're really gone

'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
You know for life, got your sis and mother
And day and night, it still hits that you're gone
And right now, I'm spilling tears in my cup
You left the world before you met Jupiter
Wish you'd have known, you would be godfather
You would've loved loving my little girls
If not for them, I'd be done with the world

Was there two hours after you passed
Speeding east to west, silent in the back of the car
Was at your mum's, there all week, trying to make sense but I can't
And although it's been a year, still feel the pain in my heart
'Cause you were there from the start
The day we met, yeah I moved in and we were never apart
People assumed that we were lovers but we're brothers in arms
Symbiotic bond of love and gave each other a chance, my god
Ah, fuck sake, lately I've been crying so much, my lungs ache
Teardrops all over my shirt like blood stains
And I know to heal a heart, it must break
But I'm done praying
They gave me a shovel at your burial and
Watching you get lowered is something I can't forget at all
And people find and stop me in the street and say it's terrible
But they don't know you like I knew you and they never will
No one saw the nights turn into day when we were battle rapping
No one saw the belly laugh, and every train to somewhere random
No one saw the holidays, and then our first experience clubbing
No one knew the things you did for me and never asked for nothing
No one read the conversations of the moves that we were planning
No one knew about the way you felt the scene, left you abandoned
No one knew about your fears 'cause you would hide them with a smile
No one knew when people took an inch, you would give 'em a mile
'Cause that was always Jamal, SB to the crowd
They used to shout your net worth, but they don't mention it now
They talk about your good deeds and infectious smile
A golden heart that's still remembered is worth more than a crown
I promised sixty-four bars and now I keep it to Tanisha
Mommy, Isaac, the gang, but I just wish that you'd seen it
I can't accept that you're gone, or the grief that I'm feeling
I prayed to God for answers but he still won't give me a reason
I think about you every day, nothing will take this pain away
I'll keep your legacy amazing, mate
The conversations at your grave's the only way to be close
I know you'll greet me with a smile on the day that I go

'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
And for life, got your sis and mother
You know I cry 'cause I miss my brother
My brother was SBTV

// Fairytale Of New York //

It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway
Was waiting for me

"You were handsome!" "You were pretty
Queen of New York City"
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
And we kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

And the boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

"You're a bum, you're a punk"
"You're an old cut on junk
Lying there almost dead
On a drip in that bed"
"You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy blagger
Merry Christmas, you mugger
I pray God it's our last"

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

"I could have been someone"
"Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you"
"I took them with me, babe
I kept them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you"

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

// Forever //

Ohh darling
Ohh darling
Ohh darling

It's 4 a.m. beneath the stars, under the night
And you're here, and you're here
Candles lit, the room is dark, the moon is light
We can lay here, we can love here

Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling
Ohh darling

I brought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine
And a blanket, we used them all
I dreamt a day away on a planet full of life
To stay there, fell in love there

Perfect comes near, perfect just for one
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love

Lying down, her cheek is resting on my shoulder
I play with her hair, I adore her
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known, yea
We could stay here, run away, dear

Love knows no fear, but it doubted some
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love

// Forever My Love //

La luz de tu mirar
Tu hermoso caminar
No existe nadie como tú

The sky magenta blue
It's only me and you
Your eyes lit up by just the moon

Sé que habrán momentos
De sufrimiento
But we'll be OK
No soy perfecto
Pero

Hey, dondequiera que estés
Ahí estaré
Hoy y mañana
Por siempre, mi amor
Y si me voy
Recuerda que
Now and tomorrow
Forever my love

Aunque no crea en mí
Tú me haces sentir
Que soy mejor de lo que pienso

Cuando te conocí
Me hiciste tan feliz
Me diste un nuevo comienzo

Sé que habrán momentos
De sufrimiento
But we'll be OK
No soy perfecto
Pero

Eh, dondequiera que estés
Ahí estaré
Hoy y mañana
Por siempre, mi amor
Y si me voy
Recuerda que
From now and tomorrow
Por siempre, mi amor

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Por siempre, mi amor

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Forever my love

Dondequiera que estés
Ahí estaré
Hoy y mañana
Por siempre, mi amor
Y si me voy
Recuerda que
Now and tomorrow
Forever my love
