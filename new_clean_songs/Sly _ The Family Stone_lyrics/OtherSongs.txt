// Everybody Is A Star //

Everybody is a star
Who could rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who will come out on a cloudy day?

'Tis the sun that loves you 'round
When the system tries to bring you down
Every had to shine at night
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right

Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be

Ever catch a falling star
Ain't no stopping 'til it's on the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle goin round and round

Shine, shine, shine, shine

// Ha Ha, Hee Hee //

Ooh, goodbye
In the dark
The rip is jean
Imagine you see
The grass in the park
Ha ha, hee hee, whoa whoa

Well well well well well
Tear up my number
Don't call
Waking me up
At 5 am
I like my dreaming
Send me a dime
Get well
Good luck
At an oath

If you're through
Or 2
You'll never miss it
Ooh whoo (ooh whoo)

Tear up my number

Well well well well well

I've got your number
No time for lovers
There goes my number
No time for lovers

// Hot Fun In The Summertime //

End of the spring and here she comes back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there

Them summer days
Those summer days

That's when I have most of my fun back
High, high, high, high there

Them summer days
Those summer days

A cloud nine when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything is cool
Ooh, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime

First of the fall and there she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there

Them summer days
Those summer days

Bop-bop-ba-bop-bop when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything is cool
Ooh, yeah

Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime

// Seventh Son //

Everybody's talkin' about the seventh son
In the whole wide world, there is only one

And I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one, there you go
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh son

I can tell your future, it will come to pass
I can say things to you, make your heart beat fast
Look in the sky, predict the rain
I can tell when a woman got another man

I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh son

I can say things to you, make it sound so sweet
I can even make your little heart skip a beat
Heal the sick, raise the dead
I can make the little girls talk out of their head

And I'm the one, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one they call the seventh, yeah

// Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) //

Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin'
I begin to run
Bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle
I was on the top

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin

Stiff all in the collar
Fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind
Words in the way

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin

Dance to the music
All nite long
Everyday people
Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama start to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
(Different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin

Flamin' eyes of people fear
Burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much
Hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is harder

Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
