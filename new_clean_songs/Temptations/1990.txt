// Let Your Hair Down //

Well
Get down
Nah nah
Hi yah hi hi hi
Ahh yah ha

Hey (Let your hair down) Oh, doctor and lawyer
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey Mister Businessman you're always on the go
You've made your fortune
Yet you're working harder than ever before
All those pills you're taking daily will never see you through
Cause none of them are prescribed for what's really ailing you (Let it down)
It don't take no doctor long to see what you got, well
Your life has turned into one great big knot
Hey yay hey now
(Let your hair down)
Can you let it down?
Let it down, let it down, awww
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey (Let your hair down)
Don't ever be ashamed of what you're doin' (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy - Hey hey hey

How do you do, Miss Saditty?
Uptight - You look such a pity
I've got some advice for you
Take this record in your room
Lock the door, and get some groove
Let it down (Let it down)
Let your hair down (Let it down)
Ayy hey
(Let it down, Let it down, let it all the way down)
All you got to do is let the music take your mind
Show your partners
Anything they can do, you can do better
(Anything they can do, you can do better) Well, well, well, well
This is the part of the song where the horns take the throne
Down (blow) dih down down hey

Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down
Hey, let it down
Let your hair down
Hey, doctors and lawyers
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
Don't you know - all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey hey hey (Let your hair down)
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while - do it, hey

// Heavenly //

So you're through with love
And you say
It's just a waste of time
(Waste of time you blew your mind)
There are two sides to love
And if you will
I'd like to show you mine
Girl, love has it's ups and downs
It's sometimes like a merry go round
Going round and around and around and around
Never knowing where you're bound
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Give me a chance to prove
Love shared by me and you can be

Heavenly

That's how love is when it's right it's right

Hey girl, be fair to your heart
Don't turn your back on love
(Don't turn your back on love)
No, no, 'cause love is the one thing everybody needs
(Everybody needs love)
Hey girl, open up your heart again
Please, won't you let me in
Give me a chance to undo, all the hurt he's put you through
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Girl, give me a chance and you'll see
Sharing your love with me will be

Heavenly

// You've Got My Soul On Fire //

Baby, you better quit, umm

Well, keep on doin' whatcha doin', yeah
Feels so good to me, girl
Keep on doin' whatcha doin', lady
Ooh, you feel so good to me
Girl, I went to see my doctor and he told me
Well, from your lovin' I've got to stay away
He told me to let you go for my heart can't stand much mo'
And there oughta be a law against lovin' a man this way
Aww, but I can't get enough of your lovin', no, Lord
And my need keeps getting stronger every day
Girl, I've got just one life to live and a lotta love to give and give
And let it be known that I ain't ashamed to say

You've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Don't you ever stop it, baby, what you doin' to me
Girl, now you've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, yeah, baby, baby
I like it, like it, like it, baby, like it, hey, girl

When it comes to lovin', you're one of a kind
Satisfaction guaranteed, every doggone time, whoa, baby
You ain't got to worry about me ever leaving you
'Cause they ain't made a woman yet that can do the things you do
Oh, oh
When you press your sweet lips to mine, oh baby
My blood starts boiling and my temperature starts to rise
Girl, I shudder, baby, and I ain't ashamed to admit it
And even if it kills me, girl, I don't want you to quit it

You've got my soul on fire, oh yeah, baby
(On fire)
I like it, I like it, like it, like it
You've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Ho, fire, aw, baby
I like it, like it, like it, like it, like it, baby, oh, baby

Ooh, girl, I like it
Ooh, ooh, woo, woo, woo, mmm, mmm, mmm
Don't stop, Lord, don't stop, I like it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, baby

When you put your loving arms around me
Girl, my mind, body and soul you control
(You control)
I'm your puppet on a string, hey, and one more thing
Woman, your love is too hot to hold

You've got my my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, baby, baby, I like it, like it, like it, like it

Better move your hair, oh yeah
Don't stop it, baby
(On fire)
Better move your hair, oh, I like it, like it, like it, like it, like it

// Ain't No Justice //

Your eyes tell a story, such a sad story
Of the things you feel inside
Of the things you cannot hide
My friend I see trouble in your eyes

There ain't no justice
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice

Build your walls
Craw into your holes
Put out your signs
Peep through your blinds
Call me, "your kind"
I don't mind
There ain't no justice
Why can't we live our lives and be friends?
In that picture that you're painting of me in your mind
Ain't no justice 'cause that face ain't mine
There ain't no justice

Close your eyes, I want you to take an imaginary trip with me
Tomorrow!

Listen to the sound of the children playing
Their young happy hearts laughing and saying
"I care not about the color of my friend,"
"I only know I'm having fun with him."
Black, white, yellow, green or blue
What does color really mean?
Yet it keeps you and I from seeing eye to eye
If nothing else let us learn from the kids
Once again, happiness

There ain't no justice when you don't trust us!

// 1990 //

Well, we got trouble in the White House
Poverty in the ghetto
When will it end?
Nobody knows!
People are asking now
"How can you spend another dollar on the space race"
"When families at home are starving right in front of your face."
Where is your heart, America?
Thousand of jobless people walking the streets
With no food or place to sleep
What will become of them, America?
I heard some people saying they had a solution
"All we got to do is change the constitution!"
What about air pollution, America?
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather be
We won all the battles there were to win
Pray that the war is at an end
That's what people pray
Listen to them, America!
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather be
