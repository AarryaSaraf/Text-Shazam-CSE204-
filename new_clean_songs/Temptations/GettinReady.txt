// Say You //

Say, you
Who do you belong to?
Say, you
I've been hoping to meet you

Baby (Baby)
You've caught my eye
I can't deny
I realize it's you
I like what I see (I like it)
You're perfect to me (I like it)
Fast and fancy

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

I don't want to be friends if my heart caved in
Watching you play around (You play around)
This would make me mad (Make me mad)
Hurt so bad (Hurt so bad)
Drag my spirit down

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

There's none quite as fair as you
(You're a sweet thing)
Let's make plans for two
Girl, say, you
If you love me, too, say you do
We shouldn't be apart
Forget your pride (Forget your pride)
Don't be shy (Don't be shy)
Give me the key to your heart, girl

Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)
Who, who do you love?

(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, say, you
Who do you belong to?
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, baby, you, (say, you) lil' girl
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)

// Little Miss Sweetness //

Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee, most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, Little Miss Sweetness
Sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now

If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes, and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read
But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought, together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell ya, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world, and that's the truth, baby
Sweetest girl in the world now
Ah yeah...
Alright

Now listen to me you sweet thing, hear what I have to say
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay
But do one thing for me, don't go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you would surely melt away

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell you, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ooh-hoo, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah yeah, sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now
The sweetest girl in the world

// Ain't Too Proud To Beg //

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Baby, baby, baby, (Ooh, sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me

// Get Ready //

I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do. (You're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, I say that you do. (You're outta sight)

So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come.

And I'm bringing you a love that's true.
So get ready, so get ready.
I'm gonna try to make you love me too.
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come.

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way.
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If you wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind you (It's alright)
But the lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you (It's outta sight)

So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come.

And I'm bringing you a love that's true.
So get ready, so get ready.
I'm gonna try to make you love me too.
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come.

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way.
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
(Get ready)

[Instrumental]

If all my friends should want you too, I'll understand it. (Be alright)
I hope I get to you before they do, the way I planned it. (Be outta sight)

So tweedley-dee, tweedley-dum
Look out baby, 'cause here I come.

And I'm bringing you a love that's true.
So get ready, so get ready.
I'm gonna try to make you love me too.
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come.

(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way.
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
(Get ready 'cause here I come-a)
(Get ready)

// Lonely, Lonely Man Am I //

Lonely, I'm so lonely
Lonely, I'm so lonely

Lonely, lonely man am I
As I sit here in my lonely room
People now, nothing seems the same since you said to me we're all through
Now, my telephone never rings anymore
And no one ever knocks on my door
Lonely, lonely man am I

Now people, sometimes I sit and I stare at her picture all day long
Wondering how could a woman that I treated so good just do me so wrong
Now, no sense in me denying
Ever since she's been gone I've been crying
Lonely, lonely man am I

Now I, haven't been able to be all right
She said to me to try to sleep at night
Everywhere I look, our picture lies a-face
I'm just a lonely man with a tear-stained face
Lonely, lonely man am I

I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm so lonely, lonely
I'm so lonely, so lonely (lonely, lonely)

// Too Busy Thinking About My Baby //

I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
At what makes a birdie fly

I don't have time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I never given a thought
To where rivers flow

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else

I ain't got time to discuss the weather
Or how long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class

And I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
And I know it's all, it's alright

I ain't got time to read a newspaper
Or look at TV
And I'm not concerned with what the future holds
In store for me

I'm just a fella
With a one, a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just dont have time

(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh yeah
Ain't got time for nothing else
You know I'm too, too busy
(Too busy thinking about my baby)
Oh baby
Ain't got time for nothing else

// I've Been Good To You //

Look what you've done
You made a fool out of someone (out of someone)
You thought love was true
And found out that you were just having fun (just having fun)

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And I recall the time, mmm-hmm
You needed somebody and I made you mine
You needed a friend so I took you in
And treated you so kind

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And you know I've always been around
And I never, never, never let you down
And now you telling me that you must go
You know that you're hurting me so...

But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you're gonna wake up and find
You'll come back to me on your bending knee
And you're gonna be crying

And oh, believe me, what I say is true, baby
After all, Lord, I've been good to you (I've been good to you)
Every day, and every way (I've been good to you)
Whoa, you know, you know, you know, baby, I've been so good
(I've been good to you)

// It's A Lonely World Without Your Love //

It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)

When I had your love, I guess I was just too blind to see
How empty life would be without the love you've given to me (oh yeah)
Selfishly, I hurt you, baby; thoughtlessly, I made you cry
Now I'm the one left alone to cry (left to cry)
Since you said goodbye (said goodbye)

It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(A lonely world without you)
So sad (Lonely, lonely world without you)

Now, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I need you (Baby, I need you)
Really got to have you (Really got to have you)
No good without you (No good without you)
Baby, I know that I'm the blame, and life won't be the same
I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

It'a just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely world without you, oh yeah)

With all my heart and soul, every night I kneel and pray
Find some plan, some schemes for me, I'll get you back one day
Baby, I should have known, I'd miss your loving when you were gone
Now I'm a lonely man (lonely man) in a lonely room (lonely room)

It's just a lonely world without you, baby
(Lonely, lonely, world without you)
Now baby, Whoa baby (Lonely, lonely world without you)

I'm so sad, baby; so lonely, baby
Can't live without you
No good without you, baby
And I'm so lonely
So lonely

// Fading Away //

The feeling we used to get whenever our lips met
Like smoke from a cigarette, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away
It hurts me to think about how love where there was no doubt
Like a cloud when the sun comes out, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away

You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going?

The plans we were making up, for I'll never breaking up
Like dreams when you're waking up, are fading away
Fading away, fading away
The good times we shared a lot, when you really cared a lot
Like steam from a coffee pot, it's fading way
Fading away, fading away

You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going?

Like smoke from a cigarette or dreams that you soon forget
Our love from the day we met, it's fading away
Fading away, fading away

You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going, going?
You've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing, tell me
Where is your love going, going?

You've changed and it's showing, baby

// Who You Gonna Run To //

When you're feeling alright, I never see you coming
But when you're hurt, you always come running
But one of these days I know, I'm gonna have to let you go

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to, baby?
Where you gonna hide?
I wanna know, who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

When you're going strong (going strong)
I don't see you at all (I don't see you at all)
But when something goes wrong (when something goes wrong)
That's when you call (that's when you call)
But if you keep doing me like you do
Then I'm gonna turn my back on you

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Now who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

When you climbed love's tree, you thought that love was a game
But now you're out on a limb, oh yes, and you're calling my name
But one of these days I'm bound, to let you come tumbling down

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?
Baby, baby, who you gonna run to? Exactly where
Where you gonna hide?

// You're Not An Ordinary Girl //

You ain't got no halo hangin' over head
You ain't got no wings that you can spread
You ain't got no harp so you can play me song so sweet
You ain't got no golden slippers on your pretty little feet

Oh, but to me you're an angel
To me you're an angel
You're not an ordinary girl
Because you're an angel to me, yeah

Now you don't have sugar sprinkled all over you
You're not made of peppermint through and through
You don't come in assorted flavors like a package of charms
And you won't stain my shirt if you melt in my arms

Oh, but to me you're candy
To me you're candy
You're not an ordinary girl
Because you're candy to me, yeah
(Candy, baby)

I know I have a cause
I have missions on trees
You might not know all the facts
About the birds and the bees
You don't send me sweet love letters with the smell of perfume
My photograph might not be plastered all over your room

Oh, but to me you're a sweetheart
To me you're a sweetheart
You're not an ordinary girl
You're a real sweetheart to me, yeah
(Sweet, sweet baby)
You're not an ordinary girl
You're a real sweetheart to me, yeah
(Sweet, sweet baby)

// Not Now (I'll Tell You Later) //

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, everybody sing now
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

When my dad thought I had become of age
He said, "Son, you're getting to the Lovin' Stage"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"It's time you stopped being all alone
You've got to find a girl you can call your own"

I said, "Not now, I'll tell you later
Not now, I'll tell you when
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

I met a little girl, fine as could be
I said, "There was a girl who was made for me"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss
So I asked the little girl for just one kiss

She said, "Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

When it's time for you to fall in love
It don't make sense for you to hurry
Take your time and make up your mind
'Cause the surer you are, the less you have to worry

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love (Everybody sing it)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
When I'm gonna fall in love (One more time, everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later...

Please give it on up (Give it up, girl)
Now

// The Man Who Don't Believe In Love //

Over there sits the man
The man who don't believe in love
And as I sit here watching him
I'm wondering what he's talking of
Does he know what he's been missing?
The lovely girls he could have been kissing?

There goes the man
The man who don't believe in love

What's that you said
You had a love that broke your heart?
Well, just go right on and forget it
And make yourself a brand new start
I know her leaving, gonna make you cry
But don't use tears for an alibi

And don't be the man
The man who don't believe in love

Hey, hey
Hey, brother
Stop feeling that way if you do
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know
If one plan don't work, surely another one will
So you'll have, have her
Don't let happiness pass you by

Don't be the man
The man who don't believe in love
You don't have to be that man
The man who don't believe in love
Don't let happiness, happiness pass you by
You don't have to use tears for an alibi
Believe me when I tell you
