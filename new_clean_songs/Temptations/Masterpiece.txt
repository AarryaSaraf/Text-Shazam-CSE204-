// Hey Girl (I Like Your Style) //

Hey girl, I want you to know
I'm going to miss you so much if you go.
And hey girl, I'll tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me is going to dye.
If you say so long, if this is goodbye.
Whoa

Hey girl, this can't be true
How am I suppose to exist without you?
And hey girl, now don't put me on
What's going to happen to me when you're gone?
How will I live, how can I go on?
How can I go on, hey girl

[Instrumental]

Hey girl, now sit yourself down.
I'm not ashame to get down on the ground
And beg you, baby. Beg you to stay.
Don't go away.

Hey girl.
Naw, naw, don't go away.
Hey girl, little girl, don't go away.
I'm beggin' you to stay.
Little girl, don't go away.
Hey girl, little girl, don't go away.

// Masterpiece //

Where I was born ev`rything was dull and dingy
I lived in a place they called the inner city
Getting ahead huh was strictly a nono
Cause nobody cares what happens to the folks
That live in the ghetto
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It`s a challenge just staying alive
`Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive

Money I ain`t got none, job can`t find one
The streets raised me from a baby, ooh
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It`s a challenge just staying alive
`Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive

Broken down homes, kids strung out
They don`t even know what life`s all about
Stealin` cars, robbin` bars
Mugging drugs, rat infested
And no one`s interested

Kids dodging cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother`s frustration
Breakings, folks comin` home
And finding all their possessions gone
Oh it`s an ev`ry day thing - well well - in the ghetto
Oh it`s an ev`ry day thing in the ghetto

// Ma //

Born in a log cabin in the back woods
The back woods of Mississippi
She drank moonshine, chewed tobacco
Raised 16 children all by herself

Never looked much like a lady
You see mama ruined her body raisin' her babies
Spend her evenings sitting in a rockin' chair
Never had much o nothin but was always willin to share

Talking 'bout ma ,talkin' 'bout ma
Yeah, yeah, yeah, talking 'bout ma
Talkin' 'bout ma

Every once in awhile when ma would get depressed
She'd go to the cabinet and get paw's guitar
Sit herself down in the rockin' chair
Start strummin' and hummin', ha ha, yeah

That was ma's way of lettin' off steam
In plan old English you could see
That ma was doin' her thing
Every once in awhile she'd shout, "Let it all hang out"

Oow talkin' 'bout ma, talking 'bout ma
Yeah, yeah, yeah, talking 'bout ma
Talking 'bout ma

// Law Of The Land //

Some people are always heaven made
Some people will live impermanent for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is better than tomorrow
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say 'yeah'
That is that, oh yes it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you will have to shed some tears - oho

It's the law of the land - my brother - oh
Whether you like it or you'll understand - ah hey hey
It's the law of the land - hey hey hey hey
'Cause made by almighty men

Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gather you either win or lose
In life's ev'rybody's got to pay some dues - well

It's the law of the land - well well well
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand - you can't change it
It's the law of the land - ah-how
'Cause made by almighty men - oh hey

Hey, it's the law, the law of the land 
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand
It's the law, the law of the land 
'Cause made by almighty men

A teacher man can't be found
Until you find yourself - think about it
You might not like being, well you ought, but you'd better start like it
But you sure can't be nobody else
In other words: I can't be you - ain't no quit, yeah - you can't be me
Well well, that's all with you, my sister an' brother
And that's the way that good life meant to be - hey-ho

It's the law of the land - well
Whether you like it or you'll understand - say say
It's the law of the land - hey yeah oh
'Cause made by almighty men

Look at here
The tools of a ??man's day has got him by corrupt??
For your own protection your Gods you must love
What goes around comes around
And what goes up, yeah, must come down - aha

It's the law of the land - well well well well
Whether you like it or you'll understand 
It's the law of the land - well well well
'Cause made by almighty men - aha

It's the law of the land - ev'rybody else say
Whether you like it or you'll understand ...

// Plastic Man //

Well, he specializes in talking trash
Carries himself like the
World's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash

The clothes he wears
Are second to none
He's a jack of all trades
And a master of none

Agrees with everything
He knows nothing about
So he doesn't feel left out

Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing so he's got to
Keep up his front

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

He always borrows
Never lends
He says, you know me, man
I'm with him, let me in

Yes, he's willing to
Stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
He won't help you if he can
Plastic Man

Claim to fame, he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just
Another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five
And talking loud

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

I guess you know he does a
Little dipping and dabbing
In a gang, they go on
Backstabbing

You better stop your fantasizing
Start, boo boo boo boom
To realizing that black is black
And white is white
Wrong is wrong and right is right

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

Plastic Man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man...

// Hurry Tomorrow //

Hey Damon, Damon! Is that you, man?
Hey, what's, what's happenin'?
What it is, what it is!
What you into man? I see you got a heavy ride, all clean...
Yeah I just copped man, just copped, you know, like hey, dig it!
I got something I wanna lay on you brother, it's the brand new thing, it's the bomb! You know?
What you got? What is it?
Mm, dig it man, you just take this and it's a brand new experience!
Nah, nuh-uh, it ain't me man, you know
Oh, what you mean, I-I tried it man, it's really really hip, it's hip
Everything will be alright tomorrow
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)
Come on man, just take it, it's really hip, I mean, I tried it, I tried it, it's cool
(Everything will be alright tomorrow)

Melting colours
That paint a picture of a new day in my mind
That I can't find at the present time, mmm
Reaching out and touching nothing
A feeling I've never felt before
(Pacing, racing, and chasing myself)
In a room without a floor or door

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

I'm goin' down, down, down
I'm goin' round
Where am I now? (Where am I now?)
The world is crumbling down
I'm laughing, I'm crying
But I still can't hear a sound

Hurry tomorrow, please
Tomorrow, I need you now
Oh, hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Good morning sunshine
(Or is it rain? It's hard to tell without windows)
I'm hurting all over
But I can't feel the pain
Screaming sounds of silence
Pound against the walls of my mind
The sun's shinin' in the middle of the night
I'm locked in, and tomorrow's nowhere in sight

Hurry tomorrow, hmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

(You better hurry)
Hurry tomorrow, mmm
Tomorrow, I need you now (Body's filled with pain)
Hurry tomorrow (Don't you know I forgot my name)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Why don't you hurry tomorrow?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Ooh, hurry, hurry, hurry)
Hurry tomorrow (Please, please, please, please)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Somebody bring me down)

Hurry tomorrow (Bring me down)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Body's racked in a whole lotta pain)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Can't you see?)
Tomorrow, I need you now (Bring me down)
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow (Somebody, somebody)
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow (Won't you come and help me now)
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now

Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
Hurry tomorrow
Tomorrow, I need you now
