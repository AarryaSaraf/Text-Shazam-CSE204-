// You Made Me Love You //

You made me love you
I didn't want to do it (no, no)
I didn't want to do it (no, no)
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes
And then you made me sad
And there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell ya (no, no)
I didn't want to tell ya (no, no)
I want a love that's true
Yes I do, you know I do, indeed I do

Give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you

Ah, you made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell ya (no, no)
I didn't want to tell ya (no, no)
I want a love that's true
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do

Give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you

Ooooh, give me, give me
Give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you

// Ol' Man River //

Here we all work, on one jar or another
Why should I work while he rolls blaze?
I get tired, so tired and weary
Got to keep tolling day by day

Ol' man river, ol' man river
He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, ah ah

No, he don't plant cotton, he don't plant taters
Them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along

Well, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along

Well, you, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Oh, tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryin'
Tired of livin', but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, yeah
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along

// Until You Were Gone //

I said I didn't need you baby
I said I'd get along
I thought I can make it without you baby
But I guess I'm not that strong
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I said I'd get over you baby
I said I'd be alright
Just, just when I start remembering
That all the hurt comes back in the night
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I tried to stay away cause I knew I couldn't win
But here I am, and I'm back again
I tried to find someone else to take your place
But everytime I close my eyes I can see in, see in your face

Oh, oh, oh, I said I'd forget you
Cause I really thought, I really thought that I could
Oh, oh, I thought I could stop of loving you
I tried it, but it didn't do no good
And I didn't know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

I said I'd get over you baby
I said I'd be alright
But, oh, oh, just when I start remembering
It comes back in the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I thought I could
Oh baby

// Follow Your Heart //

Follow your heart where it leads you (where it leads you)
Give your love to the one
The one who needs you (the one who needs you)
Darling, I'll understand and I'll step aside
I won't stand in your way if you're not satisfied (satisfied)
Follow, follow your heart

You know what's best for you (you know what's best for you)
And I love you much, too much
To try and stop you (too much to stop you)
But if you ever, ever, ever find that you are unhappy, yeah
Follow your heart back to me, yeah
Follow your heart back to me, yeah (follow your heart)

// Swanee //

Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-Even though my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (north)
Will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore

Oh, Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world if I could only be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-Even though my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (north)
Will never (will)
Just see me no more
When I get to that Swanee (Swanee)
Well, let me get through that Swanee (Swanee)
When I cross that Swanee shore

// (No, No) I'm Losing You //

I heard those rumours
You'll soon be gone
They say there's no use
In holding on
But I love you so
I will die
If I let you go

Say it's not true
No, no, no, no
I'm losing you
(I'm losing you)
(I'm losing you)

They say you're cheating
They tell me you lie
But later all change
The way I feel inside
And if it's so
Then don't tell me
'Cause I don't wanna know

Say it's not true
No, no, no, no
I'm losing you
(I'm losing you)
(I'm losing you)

If I lost you
What would I do?
And after all, all we've been through
C'mon, c'mon

Maybe she is only
A passion fame
Well, if she is
You go on and have yourself off of playing
'Cause when you're through
I'll be here
Waiting, waiting just for you

Say it's not true
No, no, no, no
I'm losing you

// Can't You Just See Me //

Can't you just see me
With my head in the air
The day you trip and fall
Right out of my hair

I'm gonna walk right by you
Like you were stone
Everything that I felt for you, baby
Will be dead and gone

Hey, can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

Hey, can't you just see me
With another man
Just a-hugging and a-kissing
And him holding my hand

I'm gonna feel so happy
Just paying you back
For the times that you hurt me, baby
By doing you just like that

Oh, can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

Can't you just see me
(Can't you just see her)
Ooh, can't you just see me now
(Can't you just see her)
Can't you just see me, girl
(Can't you just see her)
With my head in the air
(With her head in the air)

I wanna look in your eyes
(Can't you just see her)
And see a whole lotta tears
(Can't you just see her)
You know that you done me bad
(Can't you just see her)
For a whole lotta years
(Can't you just see her)
And I might slap your face
(Can't you just see her)
All over the place
(Can't you just see her)
Ooh, can't you just
Can't you just, can't you just
Can't you just see me now...

// Cry Like A Baby //

Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight
Oh, when I'm all alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
(I cry)
Oh... yeah

Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest I'm the bluest of them all
And, oh...
When I'm all alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
(I cry)
Oh... yeah

Each day I say tomorrow will be my lucky day
Ah, yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with a glad eye
And the mirror on the wall will see that I am happy one more[?]

No more nights staring at daddy's chair
Because I know that you will be standing there
Oh oh, when I'm alone, yeah, I won't
Cry like a baby
Cry like a baby
Oh yeah
Said I won't cry
I won't cry like a baby
Woo... Oh... yeah...
I said that I...
