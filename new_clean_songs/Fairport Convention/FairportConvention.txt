// Time Will Show The Wiser //

My mind keeps on telling me that this is no good
And my heart is aching, that tells me I should
But only time will show the wiser
I've fallen in love with a girl that's not mine
If I take her it will hurt him, a very best friend of mine
But I know that I need someone, to hold, to love
And my mind says I shouldn't but my heart says I should
And I don't know which to go by, my mind or my heart
And this is so confusing, it's tearing me apart
Time, it will show the wiser
Well, I wish someone would help me, this decision is mine
And my morals and emotions are hard to combine
And there is no easy way out to limit the time
That it takes till she finds out for the love that I hide
And I don't know which to go by, my mind or my heart
And this is so confusing, it's tearing me apart
Time, it will show the wiser
Time, it will show the wiser
Time, it will show the wiser

// I Don't Know Where I Stand //

Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote I love you in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in Carolina and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

// If (Stomp) //

If I were rich enough
To make you need me as much as I need you
If I could pitch enough
You'd realize what a little country bread can do

Well, if my ma
Had come that far
And if my pa
Was an old great big wig around our money town

If I were rich enough
To give you anything within the manner that you'd been accustomed to
If I could stitch enough
I'd save you nine and throw in a daisy, too

Well, if I knew
That you'd give me good times, too
And if I knew
Every loved one that I loved loved me, too

If I were rich enough
To make you need me, too

If I were rich enough
To see you pretty, looking like a scene I dreamed
If you were bitch enough
You'd leave me here, a king without a queen

Well, if you do
If you leave your little boy blue
If you do
I'll shut you out, you'll shout and you'll know it, too

If I were rich enough
To have a pair of pants, a hat, and boot for every single day I wake
And if I acted rough
You'd want me more than just for wanting's sake

Hm, that ain't so
I'll always be this way
Feelings grow
To the time when the sun shines, then we'll know

If I were rich enough
To make you need me, too

// Decameron //

She doesn't see the day today
No colours where the children play
She doesn't see the things she saw
White crosses painted on the door

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me it's a rainy day

He didn't see the summer go
Though he knew what the shadows know
He didn't see his arms grow old
He didn't feel his blood run cold

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away
Every time the sun shines, to me it's a rainy day

They listened to his voice grow pale
No stamps were on the morning mail
They all listened to the white truck ring
Words just didn't mean a thing

See me fly, see me cry, see me walk away

// Jack O'Diamonds //

Jack O'Diamonds, on the move
Jack O'Diamonds, one-eyed knave
On the move, hits the street
Bumps his head, on the ground
Well, he's a scout, you're born to lose
Shouldn't stay
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play
Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds
This one-eyed prince, wears a single love[?]
Oh sure, he's not that lovely
Jack O'Diamonds broke my hand
Left me here to stand
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to land
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card
Jack O'Diamonds is a high card
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card
But it ain't hard enough
Jack O'Diamonds can open for riches
Jack O'Diamonds but then it switches
Colour by picture but it's only a ten
Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play
Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds
This one-eyed prince, wears a single love[?]
Oh sure, he's not that lovely
Jack O'Diamonds broke my hand
Left me here to stand
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card
Jack O'Diamonds is a high card
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card
But it ain't hard enough
Jack O'Diamonds can open for riches
Jack O'Diamonds but then it switches
Colour by picture but it's only a ten
Jack O'Diamonds

// Chelsea Morning //

Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window and the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day and we'll wear it 'til the night comes

Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains and a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal peaks to beckon
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day, there's a side-show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passers-by
And pictures fly and papers lie
Just waiting to blow away

Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges too
And the light poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day and we'll talk in present tenses

Now the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I'll bring you incense owls by night
By candle-light, by jewel-light
If only you will stay

Pretty baby won't you wake up, it's the Chelsea morning

// Sun Shade //

Dying's not easy today
Trying but can't get away
Feel just the almost touch of her hand and the trees in her hair
Eyes float, the sun she saw only me in the sky
What could be higher than we

Wind grows cold in the trees
She cries so hard to please
My restless feet, the rain in the street, and her vanity fair
Sighs in the eyes of the boarding house lady who stares
Thinking I care

So it's a long dusty road
Feelings I shouldn't have showed
Follow me with a sweet heart when I'm ready to fade
Lights like these burn so bright, keep me out of my shade
Wish I could fade

Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
Just see me fade
See me fade

// The Lobster //

Like a lobster I can swim
And can grow another limb
Where a powerless stump you saw
I have grown a powerful claw

Where you thought me safely drowned
In the depths I swim around
Thither when you too descend
With my claw I'll tear you, friend

// It's Alright Ma, It's Only Witchcraft //

Looking through the window
To see which way the wind blows
It seems as though a hurricane is due today
Sunny on the outside
Stormy on the inside
Stormy weather's always best for making hay

In comes everlasting
Looks like he's been fasting
With his friends in a den with director's robe
Like a bandoliero
With his cigarillo
Robs the rich, robs the rest, brings it all back home

Please don't get us wrong, man
This is just a song, man
No matter what we say
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
You better start worrying, witchcraft's here to stay

In blows snow white
The dwarves are kind of off-white
The vision's his decision so they're out of luck
Associates are reeling
The wallpaper is peeling
He doesn't see the paperwork that's come unstuck

Please don't get us wrong, man
This is just a song, man
No matter what we say
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
You better start worrying, witchcraft's here to stay

In comes Saville
Had his fill of travel
Grabbed a bite on the flight, just touched down today
Looking drawn and haggard
Through the door he staggered
With a sound that he found over Frisco way

Please don't get us wrong, man
This is just a song, man
No matter what we say
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
This is the season
Stormy weather's on the way
You better start worrying, witchcraft's here to stay

// One Sure Thing //

He used to be the only man I would see
He used to be the only good man for me
Oh, he used to be my one sure thing
Look at me now, what you see, it isn't me
Look at me now, just a leaf without a tree
Oh, he used to be my one sure thing
My man, he doesn't care for me
And what he does, he doesn't do for me
And when I need something
To him, it doesn't mean a thing
You know he used to be my one sure thing
My man, he doesn't care for me
And what he does, he doesn't do for me
And when I need something
To him, it doesn't mean a thing
You know he used to be my one sure thing

// Suzanne //

Suzanne takes you down to a place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think that maybe you'll trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
From His lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said "All men shall be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes you down to a place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
And they're leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust her
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

// If I Had A Ribbon Bow //

If I had ribbon bow to tie my hair
And a gown of calico for me to wear
I'd surely get a sweetheart, a prince or a king
A palace home where I could have everything

If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair
This old world could come and go, I wouldn't care
I'd stay up in my castle and I'd always wear
A ribbon bow so fine to tie my hair

All the live long day to the Lord above me
All I do is pray for someone to love me

If I had ribbon bow all nice and clean
I could be a princess or a fairy queen
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair

There's a story of a girl, a story seldom told
What she wanted from this world was not of gems or gold
Her wishes were quite plain as you will see
For often she would simply make this plea

All the live long day to the Lord above me
All I do is pray for someone to love me

If I had ribbon bow all nice and clean
I could be a princess or a fairy queen
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow
A pretty little ribbon bow
Prince Charming then would court me, his love he would swear
If I had a ribbon bow to tie my hair

// Morning Glory //

I lit my purest candle close to my
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Of any vagabond who passed it by
And I waited in my fleeting house

Before he came I felt him drawing near
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
That he had come to wound my door and jeer
As I waited in my fleeting house

"Tell me stories," I called to the hobo
"Stories of cold," I smiled to the hobo
"Stories of old," I knelt to the hobo
And he stood before me and my fleeting house

"No," said the hobo, "no more tales of time
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb"
And he walked away from my fleeting house

"Then you be damned!" I screamed to the hobo
"Leave me alone," I wept to the hobo
"Turn into stone," I knelt to the hobo
And he walked away from my fleeting house

// Reno, Nevada //

It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the change in your pocket is beginning to grumble
And you reap just about what you've sown
You can walk down the street, pass your face in the window
You can go on fooling around
You can work night and day, take a chance on promotion
You can fall through a hole in the ground

Well there ain't no game like the game that you're playing
When you got a little something to lose
And there ain't no time, like the time you been wasting
And you waste just about what you choose
There's a man at the table and you know he's been able
To return all the odds that you lay
But you can't feed your hunger and you ain't getting younger
Your tongue ain't got nothing to say

It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the ground underneath you is beginning to crumble
And the sky up above you has grown
There's a time to be grieving and a time to be screaming
And a time just to stroll the wall
But you ain't got the double, and it ain't worth the trouble
Your feet are going nowhere at all
