Album: XXXV

// The Deserter //

As I was a-walking along Radcliffe Highway
A recruiting party came a-beating my way
They enlisted me and treated me 'til I did not know
And to the Queen's barracks they forced me to go

When first I deserted, I thought myself free
Until my cruel comrade informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me

Court martial, court martial, they held upon me
And the sentence passed upon me: three-hundred-and-three
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me

When next I deserted, I thought myself free
Until my cruel sweetheart informed against me
I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me

Court martial, court martial then quickly was got
And the sentence passed upon me: that I was to be shot
May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me

Then up rode Prince Albert in his carriage-and-six
Saying, "Where is that young man whose coffin it is fixed?
Set him free from his irons and let him go free
For he'll make a good soldier for his Queen and country"

// Now Be Thankful //

When the stone is grown too cold to kneel
In crystal waters I will be bound
Cold as stone, weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know

When the fire is grown too fierce to breathe
In burning irons I will be bound
Fierce as fire weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know

When the stone is grown too cold to kneel
In crystal waters I'll be bound
Cold as stone, weary to the sounds upon the wheel

Now be thankful for good things below
Now be thankful to your maker
For the rose, the red rose blooms for all to know

// Madeleine //

She was standing there, at the country fair
Sun was on her hair, I could only stare
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she had to be my bride

It was summertime, I was feeling fine
Would she join the line? I took her hand in mine
From the moment when we danced together there
I knew she was to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

While the music played, dancing through the day
We'd so much to say, time just slipped away
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she had to be my bride

She made my courage free, I sat her on my knee
Made a lover's plea, would she marry me?
From the moment when we danced together then
I knew she had to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me

When she danced with me, I was full of glee
We could happily, as a family
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Then I knew she was to be my bride

Came the wedding day, people bright and gay
Music gently played, as our vows we made
From the moment when we danced together then
I knew she had to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me

She was standing there, at the country fair
Sun was on her hair, I could only stare
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she was to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me

// My Love Is In America //

Called for this place with my working hands
Sea crossing turn my inside
Left to the sound of the marching band
We sail at the change of the tide

When I saw Mary, her father said
He was sailing across the deep blue
Brighter new days in a promised land
She would be going there too

So I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love is in America
My love could be anywhere at all

Oh, how we cried on that darkest night
Everyone leaving the land
The old generation just sitting tight
And all of us young bucks with plans

I'm using the name of another man
To get a job here for more pay
I'll walk these strange streets for a better life
London's the place, so they say

And I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love, she's in America
My love could be anywhere at all
Anywhere at all...

The music's the one thing that's travelled well
We meet up and play from our soul
The kitchen, the work yard and the Seven Bells
Gives us a glimpse of our homes

Maybe I'll make it to New York state
Maybe I'll just up and go
Maybe I'll get back to my hometown
See if there's work, I don't know

I sent many a letter to no avail
Her silence is deafening to me
Maybe she lives with another man
Crossing the new country

Till I know, I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love is in America
My love could be anywhere at all...

// The Happy Man //

How happy's that man that's free from all care
He loves to make merry, he loves to make merry
With a drop of good beer

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

How happy's that man who's free from all strife
He envies no other, he envies no other
But travels through life

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

Our seaman of gold, they fear not their foes
They throw away discord, they throw away discord
And to mirth they're inclined

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

How happy's that man that's free from all care
He loves to make merry, he loves to make merry
With a drop of good beer

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

// The Crowd //

You walk into this field of green and you sit upon the ground
You watch the pleasant world go by and you listen to the sound
The sound of people singing and the sound of all their cheers
The sound of each and everyone, you come together here
Now lay aside your sadnesses and throw your troubles down
Live just for this fine moment, pick it up and pass it 'round

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

The sea reflects the universe, all the planets, stars and moon
A puddle holds these things as well, if I'm here then so are you
For look into your neighbour's eyes and within you'll see the crowd
Everyone in everything, you are happy, you are loud

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

Stand up, stand up and follow me, sing the loudest you'll ever hear
And hold this in your memory and draw your loved ones near
Now wrap me up in voices that are always in my heart
And though I will be gone from here, we will never be apart

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you
Crowd will always be with you
Crowd will always be with you

// The Banks Of Sweet Primroses //

As I walked out on a midsummer's morning
For to view the fields and to take the air
Down by the banks of the sweet primroses
There I beheld a most love lie fair

Three short steps, I stepped up to her
Not knowing her as she passed me by
I stepped up to her, thinking for to view her
She appeared to be like some virtuous bride

I says "Fair maid, where are you going?
And what's the occasion of all your brief?
I will make you as happy as any lady
If you will grant to me one small relief"

"Stand off, stand off, you're a false deceiver
You are a false deceitful man, I know
'Tis you that has caused my poor heart to wander
And in your comfort lies no refrain"

So I'll go down to some lonesome valley
Where no man on earth shall there me find
Where the pretty little small birds do change their voices
And every moment blows blusterous wind

So come all young men who go a-sailing
Pray pay attention to what I say
For there's many a dark and a cloudy morning
Turns out to be a sunshiny day

// I Wandered By A Brookside //

I wandered by a Brookside, I wandered by a mill
I couldn't hear the water, the murmuring, it was still
Nor the sound of any grasshopper, nor the chirp of any bird
But the beating of my own heart was the only sound I heard

I sat beneath the elm tree and watched his long, long shade
As it grew so longer, I didn't feel afraid
I listened for a footfall, I listened for one word
But the beating of my own heart was the only sound I heard
The beating of my own heart was the only sound I heard

Silent tears fast flowing, when someone stood behind
A hand upon my shoulder, I knew the touch was kind
She drew me nearer and nearer, we neither spoke one word
But the beating of our own two hearts, was the only sound I heard
The beating of our own two hearts, was the only sound I heard
The beating of our own two hearts, was the only sound I heard

The only sound I heard
The only sound I heard
The only sound I heard
The only sound I heard

// Neil Gow's Apprentice //

Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's over
Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's done
I'll sit beneath the fiddle tree
With the ghost of Neil Gow next to me
Listen, Neil, your apprentice has begun

An old man looks in his inglenook and he wonders
His brother in a foreign land he must remain
Deived about the life he'd choose
They each would wear the other one's shoes
This motherland is a source of constant pain

Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's over
Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's done
I'll sit beneath the fiddle tree
With the ghost of Neil Gow next to me
Listen, Neil, your apprentice has begun

All my life I have lived within these borders
While he has gone to retrieve the setting sun
In the pitch-black Highland night
He's toiling in the sunshine bright
Do the time while summer passes by

Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's over
Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's done
I'll sit beneath the fiddle tree
With the ghost of Neil Gow next to me
Listen, Neil, your apprentice has begun

Rumbling Brig, I heard your voices calling
In the outback, still I hear your song
Feeding from this foreign field
With far more fish than the burn could yield
This trip will be my last and it won't be long

Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's over
Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's done
I'll sit beneath the fiddle tree
With the ghost of Neil Gow next to me
Listen, Neil, your apprentice has begun

Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's over
Oh, no more will I rove no more, it's done
I'll sit beneath the fiddle tree
With the ghost of Neil Gow next to me
Listen, Neil, your apprentice has begun

// Talking About My Love //

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

I could sail around the seven seas
Never reach the shore
With my rudder set on an even keel
Ropes held tight and the danger real
Drifting sometimes away
It feel, I'm sure

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

If you don't know how the day will end
There be troubles 'round the world
No one knows much about it
You can't say much about it
Sun or wind, hail or rain
Just bring us back to, still I pray

I could force ya home with an iron will
It's tempered through to blue
With a heavy hammer for my heart
Beating 'round those fiery sparks
Cooling all the while
As lovers do

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

Things come up... and bring you mixed emotion
I'm tossed around
When I'm talking about my love

// The Crowd Revisited //

The sea reflects the universe, all the planets, stars and moon
A puddle holds these things as well, if I'm here then so are you
Look into your neighbour's eyes and within you'll see the crowd
Everyone in everything, you are happy, you are loud

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

Now wrap me up in voices that are always in my heart
And though I will be gone from here, we will never be apart

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you
The crowd will always be with you
The crowd will always be with you
