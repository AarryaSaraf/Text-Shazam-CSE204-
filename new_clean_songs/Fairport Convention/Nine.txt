// The Hexhamshire Lass //

Away with the buff and the blue and away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

Her father loves her well, her mother loves her dearer
I love them better than them both but, man, I can't get near her
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

If only I could be lying there aside her
While I must bide here, my arms'll be denied her
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

Her skin is like the silk and her hair is like the silver
Her breasts are deep and cool, they'll warm when I get near her
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

Ah, this love of mine, oh, this love, I am weary
Sleep I can't get none for thinking of my dearie
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

Away with the gilded shield and away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

Away with the buff and the blue and away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the [?] and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire

// To Althea From Prison //

When love, with unconfined wings, hovers within my gates
And my divine Althea brings to whisper at my grates
When I lie tangled in her hair and fettered with her eye
Birds that wanton in the air know no such liberty

When flowing cups run swiftly round with no allaying Thames
Our careless heads with roses crowned, our hearts with royal flames
When first decreeth in wine we steep when healths and rafts run free
Fishes that tipple in the deep know no such liberty

Stone walls do not a prison make not iron bars a gate
Minds innocent and quiet take that as a hermitage
If I have freedom in my love and in my soul am free
Angels alone that soar above enjoy such liberty

// Bring 'Em Down //

Time stood dark and silent and the stars they gave no light
I wandered in an endless dream, haunted by the night
I saw four ghostly riders, the horses in a line
Each in turn did point at me and say I'm on full rein[?]
We are the sculptors of the land, the rulers of the sea
We are the falcons of your sins, gardeners of the trees
The air about you is burning and the sea below does drown
And the legacy you leave your swan[?] will surely bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down

A curse upon you men of war, with gun or pen in hand
The power sword or [?] the castles made of sand
You always have good reason to take more than you need
Your hearts are full of paper and your minds are full of greed
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down

What is deeper than the ocean, colder than the grave
Stronger than your armies all and braver than the brave?
Those who know and knowing know[?] will sow on fertile ground
Those who don't and never would are those you will go down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down

// Big William //

He never put a foot wrong
Until the day Joe met Big William
He made him an offer but he often was wrong

"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you four pence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"

"Hey Joe, hear what I say
You want my time, I ain't giving away
Go make the money you want some other way"
"I don't want to go to Peru
Don't leave (Delhi, you're any guru[?])
I don't like work and I don't like you"

"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you four pence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"

"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you four pence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"

// Pleasure And Pain //

Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

The coach that I ride has a horseman who's tired
The reins to his hands they are tied
The one to alight, if he's lucky, he might
Learn to slow down and drift with the tide

Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

It's ever so low when there's nowhere to go
And your spirit lies close to the ground
Take a long look behind, I'm sure you'll find
A friend there who'll help pull you round

Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

You have to agree, it's not easy to see
A sheep underneath all that fleece
If you'll take my advice, stick with people you like
It's a big world, you're only one piece

Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win...
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

// Possibly Parsons Green //

Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Feels like a break-up, you're taking up time

Don't say you told her, [?] still you love her
Oh, that's where you've been, I hadn't seen all the signs
You swear you've changed then you tell me again
That it's you I can trust, for you must think that I'm blind
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Stop all the schooling, just keep it cool and
Believe what I say though it may seem unkind
Too late for pleading, (I just want some peace[?])
And go find a new friend 'cause it's the end of the line
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

// George Jackson (Live) //

I woke up this mornin', there were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved, shot him the head
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sent him off to prison for a seventy-dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him and threw away the key
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

He wouldn't take shit from no one, he wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him because he was just too real
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Prison guards, they hitted him as they cursed him from above
But they were frightened of his power, they were scared of his love
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sometimes I think this whole world is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners, the rest of us are guards
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

// Six Days On The Road (Live) //

Well, I pulled out of Pittsburgh down the Eastern seaboard
I got my diesel wound up and she's a-running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead all right but I can't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got ten forward gears and a George Overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are opened wide
And I just passed a Jimmy and White, been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, the FBI is checkin' on down the line
Well, I'm a little overweight but my log books way behind
But nothing bothers me tonight, I'm gonna dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like some other guys
I could find me one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

My rigs a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a good flame blowing from her smoke stack black as coal
Well, my home town's coming in sight and if you think I'm happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
