// Matthew, Mark, Luke & John //

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

When every word's been sung or spoken
And bygone battles have been lost or won
When all is mended that once was broken
Who crawled will surely run
And when all our creeds and all of our deeds
Are centered on each other's needs
When men are mending harmonies
The world will have begun

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Are you really real, do you love every one?
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

If the sins of the father are also the son's
What chance do we have in this game
Everything's blacker, we argue with guns
With money we burn and we maim
And is it all for a reason, this game without end
To be rich, you have to have poor
And is feasting to famine like sitting to standing
Or is there a hole in God's door?

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Are you really real, do you love every one?
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

Matthew, Mark, Luke and Paul
Are your fingers in your ears, can you hear us at all
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

// Knights Of The Road //

Set out from Carlisle with the sun beside him
Sinking low across an empty field
Old moon a-rising, the first lone star a-shining
Shadows rolling down the lonely hills

Run down by Lichfield and the rain it started pouring
Water flowing up along the road
Listen to the rumble of the ten big wheels a-turning
Listen for the shifting of the load.

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Hauling the load, making it the hard way

Miles crack on by and he sang with his engines
Old tunes like "Kisses sweeter than wine"
Dreaming of the girl he'd be lying with at sunrise
Another lonely milestone passed him by

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Hauling the load, making it the hard way

Lightning it crashed and he never saw it coming
They found him with his hands still at the wheel
Just another poor boy trying to keep 'em running
He died lugging 30 tons of steel

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Making it the hard way

// The Plainsman //

I come from the moor and the mountain, from the waterfall and stream
I've turned my back on the mountain track; I'm walking in a dream
And every new horizon to me it seems the same
And everywhere looks old and bare while trav'ling on the plains

There's no one rides this road with me, a plainsman rides alone
The welcome waits by a city gate, no voice to call me home
Alone I came into this place, and that is how I will go
And all I learn is the season's turn, that's all I need to know

Oh the world is hung with silver tongues with good advice to give
If you can't show me how to die, don't tell me how to live
The plainsman's song, though it's seldom long, it's more than meets the ear
And all I believe is the falling leaves at the turning of the year

// Hungarian Rhapsody //

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Finished our food and got into the wagon
To drive 80 miles and then do the show
5 hours later, we're still busy trucking
Banging and bumping; don't know where to go

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Got to the gig, although nobody else did
Set up the gear and began to play
Farmers and soldiers just standing and staring
Just didn't know what to make of the day

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Finished the last song and made for the exit
But the manager man had come up from the sticks
He said "why ain't you dressed like a poofter ensemble
Leaping pianos and waving your legs?"
Dear Mr Hilter, we've been meaning to tell you
It's really quite simple, you don't have to fear
We ain't your Rolling Stones, we ain't your T-Rex
Actually we're only here for the beer

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Into the van again, out on the highway
Back to our hotel to take a rest
Everyone's swigging their Egri Bikaver
Things really were funny in old Budapest

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine
Oh what a time we had down by the Danube
Drinking our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
I've fucked it up!

// My Girl //

There's been times in my past when the bad times have shone through
And I couldn't hide how hard it was to live not knowing you
And I still believe that long ago in some forgotten pain
I swore to close the door on loving anyone again
With a way of her own is shaking me
With a way of her own is taking me

I was happy when I woke to find you sleeping without care
And I gently took my fingers and I brushed away your hair
The day began in silver dawning on your brow
And I shook hands with the morning for letting me love you now
With a way of her own is shaking me
With a way of her own is taking me

Come up with the wind of what is done begins to blow
Run off every time you feel the need to see me show we go together

The walks to where the sun is and the standing in the cold
Brown leaves in the autumn and always you to hold
I could watch your ways forever and speak my mind begins
Happy in your happiness and tearful in your tears
With a way of her own is shaking me
With a way of her own is taking me
With a way of her own is shaking me
Can't you see that I'm different she's waking me

// Me With You //

It's nice to sit on the highest cliff
For a minute or two
And it's nice to ride a stallion or go sailing in a galleon
With a good crew
And it's nice to walk the clover
When its wet all over in the morning dew
Did you ever see a dogs nose quiver when the wind blows
That's me with you

Breaking up the fresh bread throwing crumbs on the bed
I'm a lout
Smiling at the wall and tying up a shoestring
I'm going out
Happy as a heffer chewing the cud
Happy as a bubble in mud
Did you ever hear a tune slide swinging from the inside
That's me with you

If you take some yellow add a little bit of blue
You're bound to get green
And if you keep a horse from water sooner or later he turns mean
Well its nice to have a nibble
But don't you go and let it spoil the meal
I'm a feather from a black crow beady on the hedgerow
That's me with you

Well its nice to stroll when the storm is gone
And it all smells new
And its nice to seem wise when you've only surmised
And you haven't really got a clue
When you think you are done and no one sings your song sing blues
Tougher than a toenail tighter than a cats tail
That's me with you

Soft as whiskers on a horse's chin
Just like a Cheshire cat, I'm good with a grin
Like an eight nine ten jack queen with a king
Happy as King Arthur and his magic blade
Sleeping by the lizard in the shade
Happy as a fox out on a midnight raid
Happy as a landlord when his rent gets paid
I'm just like an egg that's fresh I'm newly laid
Yes me with you...
