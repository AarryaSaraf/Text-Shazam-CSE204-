// Old Mother Reagan //

Old Mother Reagan and her crew took away from me and you! 
I hope she goes far away, she better go far away...
Y'know it ain't right when it's all wrong,
This is the Old Mother Reagan protest song. 
Old Mother Reagan -- she's so dumb! She's so dangerous!
How come she don't go far away, she better go far away...
Old Mother Reagan went to heaven, but at the pearly gates, she was stopped!

// No Killing //

I don't wanna see my brother die 
We don't want no killing Lord 
I don't wanna to see my sister cry 
I don't wanna see 
I don't wanna see I I I I I 
I know that bad things are going down 
I, I know that loneliness is all around 
I know that the world is starved for love 
Love 
Y'know that there's good 
And there's evil 
And there's evil 
Disguised as good 
They're knocking at my door 
They're knocking at my door 
Don't let them in 
Don't let them in 
I think it's the Milwaukee Police 
I think it's the police 
I think it's the polizei 
I think it's the polizei I I I 
Everyday everyday everyday everyday 
I need your love love 
And it's a bad bad score 
And I need you all the more 
I need your love 
Love

// Faith //

In the Lord 
Got my faith baby 
In the Lord Lord Lord 
And I know 
He'll make everything alright 
No matter where a child roam 
That child's gonna have a home 
If he's got his faith alright 
I don't believe in no car 
I don't believe in General Motors 
I don't believe in the President 
Or the League of Women Voters 
I don't believe in these things 
All these things might fail 
I don't believe it's gonna snow 
It might sleet rain or hail 
But I believe in the Father 
I believe in the Son 
I believe there's a Spirit 
For everyone 
I believe in the Father 
I believe in the Son 
I believe there's a Spirit 
For everyone 
That's not all 
That's not all 
I'm gonna tell y'all 
Let's do the faith call 
I said F----F 
I said A----A 
I said I----I 
I said T----T 
I said H----H 
What's that spell---Faith 
What's that spell---Faith 
Oh Faith

// Breakin' Hearts //

See that girl 
She put me in a whirl 
She's got a way of breakin' hearts 
Man o man 
I wonder if I can 
She's got a way of breaking hearts 
Seems like she is always 
Workin' on the sly 
Then she tells her poor man 
Good bye 
Holy smoke 
I wonder if there's hope 
She's got a way of breakin' hearts 
I will not tarry 
I'm askin' her to marry me 
Even though she's got a way of 
Breakin' hearts

// Love & Me Make Three //

Where were you 
When Judas needed a band 
Sitting in the backseat 
With another woman in your hand 
Don't look this way 
With your changing point of view 
Just sit on a fence 
And pretend to be you 
Christ is crying 
Outside your church door 
Don't let him in 
He'll get mud on your floor 
Just put on your apron 
And count up all the money 
Don't you smell the burning 
And you just think it's funny 
You love yourself 
You love yourself 
Have we become what we wanted? 
You go ahead, I'll love myself more 
You're a man 
Who works for the Lord 
Polishing the statues 
When their faces look worn 
The best of times 
And the worst of men 
Don't seem to affect you 
You're asleep again 
You love yourself 
You love yourself 
Have we become what we wanted? 
You go ahead, I'll love myself more

// Candlelight Song //

In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
Kind and kindly 
Soft and silly 
Wile and willy-ling-ly-lessness
Much less much less 
What's best what's best 
Lifelessness 
My doll is dead 
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along

In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
Kind and kindly 
Soft and silly 
Wile and willy-ling-ly-lessness

Lifelessness 
My doll is dead 

Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along

In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
...

// I Held Her In My Arms //

I'm gnawing on the knowledge that I have been burnt
And I'm learning things that I should've already learnt
Everyone I ever knew was so kind and coy
I was with a girl, but it felt like I was with a boy

I can't even remember if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to
But I held her in my arms, I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you

I will not kill the one thing I love
In this world of wreckage, I look above
Help me, Lord, help me understand
What it means to be a boy and what it means to be a man

I can't even remember if we were lovers, or if I just wanted to
But I held her in my arms, I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms but it wasn't you

// Children Of The Revolution //

You can bump and grind
Have a good time
You can twist and shout
Let it all hang out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can tell a plane, in the falling rain
I got a Rolls Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can bump and grind
Feeling fine
You can twist and shout
Knock yourself out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you can't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution
No you can't fool the children of the revolution
No you won't fool the children of the revolution

You can bump and grind
Have a good time
You can bump and grind
Have a good time

Bump and grind
Have a good time

// Good Friend //

How I'd love you so 
The way good friends do 
The way I would be you 
And me too, I'd be your 
Good friend, I'd be your 
Good friend, I'd be your 
Good friend 
That's what I would've been 
Oh but everytime I turn around 
My heart's on the mend 
These feelings I have 
I have to suspend 
Seems like everytime I turn around 
My heart's on the mend 
Because I don't think you want me 
To be your good friend 
Yesterday is a laugh 
And the traumas slip past 
And I don't think 
That I'll be doing a lot of crying 
But I'll sure do my share of sighing 
I would have been your...

// Heartache //

Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
I know nobody ever taught you 
How to dance like that 
Nobody ever taught you 
How to dance like that 
Nobody ever taught me 
How to dance like that 
Heartache---too late 
And I gotta get up 
Heartache---too late 
And I gotta get up 
Heartache---too late 
And I gotta get up 
I know 
I been workin' twenty-five hours a day 
I don't want to live this way 
Five and a half weeks with one day off 
Stop the train I'm getting off

// Cold Canyon //

Look out for what I can get 
Another blessed highway 
Hey mister you're gonna regret 
'Cause you just reminded me of something 
I long to forget 
But no matter how much he drink or smoke 
My memory's still clear 
It hurts me dear 
It's sharp today like it was yesterday 
No I don't have much hope 
Just the other night I came 
Face to face with my past 
Came down like a lightning bolt 
Struck me with a flash 
I was praying all along 
That it would not last 
Oh stop it stop it stop it stop it 
Y'know the last time you rang 
I nearly died I almost cried 
I put my pride in my pockets 
And said you gotta stay cool cool cool 
Y'know some things just gotta hang 
Oh Lord Lord 
Take me back 
I'm going back 
The long track 
So do yourself a favor 
And leave me if you please 
I'm in a cold cold canyon 
With a cold cold canyon breeze 
Woke up in a strange room 
And then I saw a door 
I went right over and opened it 
Though I'd never been there before 
Started presiding over the meeting 
The chairman said I had the floor 
And when we adjourned everyone 
was satisfied 
We all got our money 
Then went out where it was sunny 
But it was kind of funny 
To find out that I was such a dummy 
But there's no place you can really hide

// Two People //

I'm thinking of two people
That I could love 
Oh momma make me feel so good 
Whatever I think of 
Oh and I know 
It don't seem like I have that much to give 
We could find a foreign place 
Where we could live

// World Without Mercy //

When your words have no meaning
and you're known as no one,
am I someone to you,
someone to turn to,
even when others turn away?
Even though others turn away?

When history blurs,
and every man, women, and child,
are left outside with no phones to be dialed,
you can't call me, I can't you.
You can't call me, I can't you.

In a world without mercy,
people dine outside your door.
In a world without mercy,
you don't have to lie anymore.
You don't have to cry anymore.

When laughter loses all its humor
and the joke is on you,
don't take it so personal,
all this world reversal.
The things they said don't matter anyway.
The things they said don't matter anyway.

In a world without mercy,
people dine outside your door.
In a world without mercy,
you don't have to lie anymore.
You don't have to cry anymore.

Oh, can it be so painful?
Can it be so blind?
Love is vicious angel,
fluttering wings, trapped inside your mind.

When your words have no meaning
and you're known as no one,
am I someone to you,
someone to turn to,
even when others turn away?
