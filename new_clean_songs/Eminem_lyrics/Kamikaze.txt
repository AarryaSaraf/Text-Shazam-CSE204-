Album: Kamikaze

// Paul (Skit) //

[Paul Rosenberg:]
Hey Em. It's Paul. Umm, I listened to the new album. Umm, are you really gonna just reply to everybody who you don't like what they have to say, uh, about you or the stuff you're working on? I mean, I don't know if that's really a great idea; it's-it's like, what's next? Kamikaze 2, the album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made replying to everybody that didn't like the previous album. It's a slippery slope. I-I don't know if it's a really good idea. Uh, anyway, hit me back.

// Em Calls Paul (Skit) //

Paul, yo, um
So I got your message, I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um...
([GPS:] Turn right)
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like, what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo mother fucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I, literally said I rhymed "rhymes" with "chimes"
"Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes"
([GPS:] Turn right)
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
([GPS:] Turn left)
I'll hit you back later
