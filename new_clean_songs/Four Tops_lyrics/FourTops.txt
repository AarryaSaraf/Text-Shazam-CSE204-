// Baby I Need Your Loving //

Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah

When you see me smile, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel half alive

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

// Where Did You Go //

A few words, said in anger
Have put my lonely heart in danger
One mistake, made you part
But when you left, you took my heart

I now sit quietly in a room
Hoping you'll return real soon

Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Only your warm embrace
Can fill this empty place

I look up and down each lonely street
Hoping one day soon we'll meet
Searching here, searching there
Looking for you, everywhere

Your love it means the most to me
I need you close to me

Where did you go girl?
Where did you go?

Only your warm embrace
Can fill this empty place

I pass the house you used to stay
It's lonely and vacant, I'm the same old way
When our friends mention your name
The hurt, comes back again

No matter what I try to do
I can't get over losing you

Where did you go?
Where did you go?

I've been searching for you everywhere
Where did you go?
Where?

// Ask The Lonely //

Just ask the lonely

When you feel that you
Can make it all alone
Remember no one is big enough
To go it alone

Just ask the lonely
They know the hurt and pain
Of losing love you can never regain
Just ask the lonely

The young and foolish laugh at love
So they run away
Confident and sure that fate
Will bring another love their way

But ask the lonely
How vainly a heart can yearn
For losing love that will never return
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you

They'll tell you a story of sadness
A story too hard to believe
They'll tell you the loneliest one is me
Just ask the lonely

Ask me
I'm the loneliest one you'll see

// Your Love Is Amazing //

(Ooh, (darling) your love's amazing)
(Ooh, (yeah, yeah) your love's amazing)

You made a wanderer like me
Into what I'm supposed to be
Stood beside me, right or wrong
Erased my weakness and made me strong

Gonna keep loving you my whole life through
'Cause no one ever does the things you do

Ooh wee, your love's amazing
Ooh wee, your love's amazing

With nothing to cling to, so afraid at night
Nothing for me seems to go right
Darling you stretched out your hand
And made me a better man

Gonna keep loving you my whole life through
'Cause no one ever does the things you do

Ooh, your love's amazing
Darling, ooh girl, your love sure 'nuff is amazing

Bad things about me, I know you've heard
But you never said a mumbling word
Darling, darling

Darling ooh wee, your love's amazing
Darling ooh wee, it sure 'nuff is amazing

[?] for love [?]
The things you do to me
It just make me feel good all over
Hey!
Darling, you, yeah
Your love is amazing

// Sad Souvenirs //

One love letter filled to the brim
With your heartless lies
One tired old worn out handkerchief
I used to dry my weeping eyes

These things are all I have left
Of a love I built my world around
And they're sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One tired old empty dream
That will never ever ever come true
One battered, broken heart
Misused by you
These things are all that I own
These things alone are sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs
Sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One thousand lonely, lonely nights
One thousand tears I shed in vain
One thousand little silent prayers
To have your love again
These things are all I have left to look forward to
Darling since I lost you
They're sad, sad, sad
Sad souvenirs
Sad souvenirs

One love letter filled with lies
A worn out handkerchief to dry my eyes
Lonely nights, empty empty tears
Sad, sad, sad souvenirs

// Love Has Gone //

Love has gone, love has gone

Love has gone
And left me in misery
Love has gone
No more joy will there be for me

A hollow man, leaving me a helpless man
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
No more peace shall I find
Love has gone
Leaving heartaches behind, oh yeah

When I lost that little girl
I lost sight of the world
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
There's nothing left for me
Love has gone
Love is gone, I'm not what I used to be

I've been robbed of happiness
I'm no good, I must confess
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
Love has gone
Love has gone
Love has gone

// Call On Me //

Darling, you say you're lonely, well, I'm lonely too
But togetherness is the answer for me and you
Now I know, since he left you haven't been the same
And memories are all that remain

But darling, call on me, call on me, call on me, call on me
If you ever need that someone, call on me

And you've been so misunderstood
And you haven't known love as you should
Now I don't, see I don't know fancy words to say
But I do know how to love you all the way

So darling, if you want me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Darling, if you need me and if you want me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Oh call me, call me
If you ever need someone, call on me
Call on, call on, call on, yeah
If you need me, call on me
Darling, call on me, call on me
