// I Got A Feeling //

When your in arms, darling
When your in my arms

That feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You shake me, break me
Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

When you lock me in, your embrace
And breathlessly, you kiss my face
I get a strange sensation
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You take control,
Of my very soul,
Everytime your close to me
You make me quiver and shake
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

I touch your lips, your fingertips
I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction
Darling, you know that
I can't stand it, stand it

Feeling, feeling
And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You're earthquakin', soul shakin'
Ever lovin', breath takin'
You're electrifying, oh
Soul satisfying

When you walk, in a room
Right away I start to swoon
I'm not sure of what you got,
But what it is, I like alot

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

Shake me, break me
Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Oh I can't stand it, stand it

Oh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

// Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever //

I remember yet before we met
When every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one
(Lonely one)
I remember meeting you, discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one
(Only one)

When you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
And we could not be parted
(We could not be parted)

I said, I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I've never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life so much sweeter than ever

Each night I pray we never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger from day to day
As best I can, how I try to reassure you, satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
(Went away)

'Cause I really need you
(Really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(Need for you to need me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, yes it has
Since I'm loving you, my life is so much sweeter than ever

'Cause I really love you
(Really really love you)
Girl, I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
You know it has, yes it has
Loving you, since I've been loving you, my life's sweeter than ever
Since I'm loving you, my life is sweeter than ever, yes it has

// Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over) //

All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking, "She don't love him"
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms, you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me
Wake me, when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear

Through these walls so thin, I hear my neighbors when
They say, "She don't love him, she don't love him"
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me for the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me
Wake me somebody when it's over, when it's over
And tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

Girl, you're what my heart desires
My whole world you inspire
I can't bear to be losing you
'Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly, I pace the floor
Listening to my neighbors criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe, I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me, I'm dreaming now

I said, shake me
Wake me somebody when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming
And wake me when it's over, when it's over
Come on and shake me, wake me somebody
When it's over

// Michelle //

Michelle, ma belle 
These are words that go together well 
My Michelle 

Michelle, ma belle 
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble 

I love you, I love you, I love you 
That's all I want to say 
Until I find a way 
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand 

Michelle, ma belle 
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble 

I need to, I need to, I need to 
I need to make you see 
Oh, what you mean to me 
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean 
I love you 

I want you, I want you, I want you 
I think you know by now 
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand 

Michelle, ma belle 
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble 
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand 
My Michelle

// In The Still Of The Night //

In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window 
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
The times without number
Daring that I say to you

Do you love me 
Like I love you
Are you my life to be
My dream come true
Or will that dream fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night

// Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars //

Quiet nights 'n quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go
To watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you!
...

// Then //

If Columbus never sailed the sea,
If Longfellow never wrote a rhyme,
If leaves have never grown upon a tree,
And if the sands have never told the time,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love I feel couldn't possibly be real

If Beethoven never wrote a song,
And if Shakespeare never wrote a play,
If a man has never been wrong,
And if night has never followed day,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love for you couldn't possibly be true.

If high is low, and up is down,
And if love is not considered an emotion
(If yes is no)
If yes is no
(And square is round)
And square is round
(And if waves have never road across the ocean)
Oh-o-oh
If Michelangelo could never paint,
And if Jezebel was a saint,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love form couldn't possibly be strong

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love for you couldn't possibly be true
