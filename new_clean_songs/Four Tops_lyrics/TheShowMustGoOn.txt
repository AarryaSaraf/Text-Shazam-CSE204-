// Save It For A Rainy Day //

You better save it, save it
Well, well, well, well

Well, she's kinda pretty
Drives a big car too
And when I hold her in my arms
I never know what to do

She's got everything she needs
What does she need me for
Just a crazy fool comin' back for more

I know she's no good
Can't live without her knowing that I should
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy

You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day

Well, I'd be there in a minute if I only could
When she touches me
It makes me feel so good

My heart's in her hand
This sure is a mess
There's no way I'll say, "No"
If she says, "Yes, yes, yes"

Take me, shake me
Tell me this ain't a dream
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy

You better save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it for a rainy day

Hear the music y'all
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom

You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day

You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day

You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day
You better save it, save it, save it for a rainy day
