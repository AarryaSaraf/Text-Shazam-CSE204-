// Music For A Sushi Restaurant //

(Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine)

Green eyes, fried rice
I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time
Coffee on the stove, yeah
You're sweet ice cream
But you could use a flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted round your tongue

I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, baby

"Excuse me, a green tea?"
Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want

I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool

You know I love you, babe

If the stars were edible
And our hearts were never full
Could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, baby

// Late Night Talking //

Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you
Mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through

If you're feeling down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too
(Ooh-woo)

If you're feeling down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (Get you off my mind)

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind (All this late night talking)
Can't get you off my mind (All this late night talking)
I won't even try (All this late night talking)
Can't get you off my
All this late night talking

// Grapejuice //

One, two, three
One, two-

Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me

But I got over it and I said
"Give me something old and red"
I pay for it more than I did back then

There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you

Sitting in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we've been
You're always there, so don't overthink
I'm so over whites and pinks

I pay for it more than I did back then

There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
1982
Just me and you
There's just no getting through
The grape juice blues

One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One

// As It Was //

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

// Daylight //

I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose bleeding
Looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight

Out of New York
I'm on the come down speed
We're on bicycles
Saying there's life out there
You've got the antidote
I'll take one to go, go please
Get the picture
Cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You got me cursing the daylight
Daylight
You've got me calling at all times
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight

If I was a blue bird
I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

// Little Freak //

Little freak
Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze
Crystal ball
Somehow, you've become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me

I was thinking about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinking about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Who you will go home to
I'm just thinking about you
Just thinking about you

Did you dress up for Halloween?
I spilled beer on your friend
I'm not sorry
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we'll do this again
Tracksuit and a pony tail
You hide the body all that yoga gave you
Red wine and a ginger ale
But you would make fun of me for sure

I was thinking about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinking about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinking about you

I disrespected you
Jumped in feet first and I landed too hard
A broken ankle
Karma rules
You never saw my birthmark

I was thinking about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinking about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinking about you
Just thinking about you
Just thinking about you

// Matilda //

You were riding your bike to the sound of It's No Big Deal
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal

You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up

Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside
You showed me a power that is strong enough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business but it's just been on my mind

You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up
You can see the world
Following the seasons
Anywhere you go
You don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own

You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words
I know they won't hurt you anymore as long as you can let them go

You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry, no

// Cinema //

You got, you got the cinema

It's you
And I'm not getting over it
Darling, is it cool
If I'm stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we're in time
If you're getting yourself wet for me
I guess you're all mine
When you're sleeping in this bed with me

I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool too?
Or am I too into you?

Tell me what you want and you got it, love
I want all of you
Gimme all you got
That's cinema
That's cinema, uh-huh

It's you
I don't know why but it feels so right to me
Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me

You all the time (Time, time)
In doses at night (Night, night)
No roof on the drive
Dust off the high
And go to sleep (Go to sleep, go to sleep)

I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool too?
Or am I too into you?
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool too?
Or am I too into you? (Cinema)

Cinema

You got, you got
I bring the pop, you pop
You got, you got
I bring the pop
You got, you got the cinema
I bring the pop to the cinema, you pop
You got, you got the cinema
You got, you got the cinema
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate

You got, you got the cinema
You got, you got the cinema (Cinema)
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, cinema)

You got, you got the cinema
You got, you got the cinema
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, you're cinema)

You got, you got the cinema
You got, you got the cinema
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate (Baby, you're cinema)

You got, you got the cinema
You got, you got the cinema
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate

// Daydreaming //

Living in a daydream
She said, "Love me like you paid me"
You know, I'll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Stay until the morning
'Cause baby, loving you's the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

// Keep Driving //

Black and white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ash tray
Swimming pool
Hot wax
Jump off the roof

A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask
"Should we just keep driving?"

Maple syrup
Coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown
Egg yolk
I will always love you

A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask
"Should we just keep driving?"
Should we just keep driving?

Passports in foot wells
Kiss her and don't tells
Wine glass, puff pass
Tea with cyborgs
Riot America
Science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
Cocaine, side boob
Choke her with a sea view
Toothache, bad move
Just act normal
Mocha pot, Monday
It's all good, hey you
Should we just keep driving?
Should we just keep driving?
Should we just keep driving?

// Satellite //

You got a new life
Am I bothering you?
Do you wanna talk?

We share the last line
Then we drink the wall
Till we wanna talk

I go round and round
Satellite

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

(Spinning out, waiting for you)

I'm in an LA Mood
I don't wanna talk to you
She said, "Give me a day or two"

I go round and round
Satellite

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Right here, right here
Spinning out, waiting for you
I'm here, right here
Wishing I could be there for you

Be there for you
Be there for you (For you)
For you
Be there for you

Spinning out, waiting for you to pull me in
(Spinning out, waiting)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinning out, waiting for you)

Spinning out, waiting for you (For you) to pull me in (For you)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?

Spinning out, waiting for you (For you) to pull me in (For you)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinning out, waiting for you)

// Boyfriends //

Boyfriends
They think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know they're just misunderstanding you
You, you're back at it again

Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
You love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You, you, you still open the door

You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only calling you when
Don't want to be alone
Oh, and you go
Why? You don't know

Boyfriends
Are they just pretending?
They don't tell you where it's heading
And you know the game's never ending
You, you lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You feel a fool
You're back at it again

Ooh, ooh

// Love Of My Life //

Baby, you were the love of my life
Whoa
Maybe you don't know it's lost till you find it

Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find something for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
Take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel using someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place
It's not the same anymore

Baby, you were the love of my life
Whoa
Maybe you don't know it's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted
To leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But baby, you were the love of my life

It's unfortunate, ooh
Just coordinates, ooh

I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doing everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?

Baby, you were the love of my life
Whoa
Maybe you don't know it's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted
To leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But baby, you were the love of my life
