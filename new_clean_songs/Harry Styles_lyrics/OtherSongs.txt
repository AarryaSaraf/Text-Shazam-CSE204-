// Anna //

Don't know where you're laying, just know it's not with me
Don't know what I'd tell you if I passed you on the street

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

Don't know how you taste when there's smoke in your perfume
So chew me up and spit me out, nothing left to lose

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

Hope you never hear this and know that it's for you
I don't know what I'd tell you if you asked me for the truth

I don't want your sympathy
But you'll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

[Snippet of "Faith" by George Michael:]
Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body

I don't want your sympathy
But you'll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna

// Baby Honey //

Well, I think I wrote a song that all your friends are gonna like
But they'll tell you that they hate it when they don't, just because it's mine
And I swear that I'm not thinkin' 'bout you all the time
It'll only take a minute, take a listen maybe change your mind

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess you'll never know-ow

Woo!

Oh, I know he's got the money, baby honey, does he make your night?
Is it true he doesn't touch you in the place, the way I know you like?
And I swear that I'm not thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Just today, yesterday, every day, and tomorrow night

Ahh...

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess we'll never know-ow

I swear I'm not thinkin' 'bout you now-ow (over, over over, over)
I swear I'm not thinkin' 'bout you now (over, over, over, over)

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess we'll never know-ow
I... yeah!

// Complicated Freak //

She got wrapped up in somebody else
I'm wrapped up stuck in love with myself
I never saw this coming around
But I miss her skin on me now
Tip of my tongue she's pulling my hair
I do what she wants anywhere
Back seat of the car and up in the air
But I miss how she kissed everywhere

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak

Turned up too late one too many times
Bad choice of words in my alibi
I guess I love crazy, out of your mind
You lost your head, so I'll give you mine

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak

She got wrapped up in somebody else
I'm wrapped up stuck in love with myself (Ha)

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak

// Don't Let Me Go //

Now you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on, it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be

I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in its bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two

I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand
I'll keep my eyes wide open, yeah

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me go

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone

// Girl Crush //

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain't slowin' down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh she's giving you now

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then you'd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

I don't get no sleep, I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her under your bedsheets
The way that she's whisperin', the way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried, I can't get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then you'd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush

Oh I gotta girl crush

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain't slowin' down

// Him //

So you were right
There's always two
The one who stays, and the one who's leaving you
Hear me out, my apologies
'Cause I'm not here for sympathy

'Cause I don't want to hear about him
How he's holding you better at night
And I don't want to hear about him
In these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
So I don't want to hear about him

That nice dress in my wildest dreams
Lipstick stains you left still on my sheets
When I hear "amazing eyes"
It breaks my heart every time

'Cause I don't want to hear about him
How hе's holding you better at night
And I don't want to hear about him
In these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
So I don't want to hear about him

Do you know what it's like to fall in love from the outside
And I don't know but I've been trying for you, for me
Now I know what it's like to fall in love from the outside
I...

So I don't want to hear about him
How he's holding you better at night
I don't want to hear about him
And these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
I don't want to hear about him

Is he holding you better at night?
Is it me running into your mind?
I still think about you all the time

// Isn't She Lovely //

Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she pretty
Truly the angels' best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

// Juice //

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it, 'cause I know I'm cute (ooh, baby)
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes (ooh, baby)
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ (ooh, baby)
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll

If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (so you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lied

It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

No, I'm not a snack at all
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (ooh, baby)
Jeffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel (ooh, baby)
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this (like this, like this)

If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (so you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lied

It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

Somebody come get your man

You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?
Way more than friends
What you want me to say?

It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose

Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

// Just A Little Bit Of Your Heart //

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with
I can't even think straight but I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool, I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

// Landslide //

I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
And I'm getting older too
Yes, I'm getting older too

Oh, take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down
The landslide will bring it down

// Leather And Lace //

[Stevie:]
Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow?
You're saying I'm fragile, I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life and I am stronger than you know
But I carry this feeling when you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling when you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains, stay with me stay
I need you to love me, I need you today
Give to me your leather, take from me my lace

[Harry:]
You in the moonlight with your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me?
And you were right when I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man, sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you, I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
But that time I saw you, I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

[Stevie & Harry:]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains, stay with me stay
I need you to love me, I need you today
Give to me your leather
[Stevie:]
Take from me my lace
[Stevie & Harry:]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains, stay with me stay
[Stevie:]
I need you to love me, I need you today
[Stevie & Harry:]
Give to me your leather, take from me my lace
[Stevie:]
Take from me my lace, take from me my lace

// Medicine //

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, feeling it out
Feeling it out

I had a few, got drunk on you and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you... (tasted)

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm OK with it

I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you... (ride it)

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

I had a few, got drunk on you and now I'm wasted

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

// The Chain //

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Running in the shadows
Damn your love
Damn your lies

Break the silence
Damn the dark
Damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
If you don't love me now
Never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together
Running in the shadows
Chain, keep us together
Running in the shadows
Chain, keep us together
Chain, keep us together

// Ultralight Beam //

We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything, it's everything

I'm tryna keep my faith, but I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith, but I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war

We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, baby
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything

Foot on the devil and I move with my family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like Sia, you can't see her

I'm just having fun with this
Know I'm feeling so lost

Laugh in my head maybe my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

Now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything

I'm just having fun with this, know I've been feeling so lost
Laugh in my head I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

And now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
