Album: Jugulator

// Jugulator //

Now let's see what you're made of
He is coming, you can't run
Violators that get caught
Will wish that they'd never been born

Exterminator
You are dead
Mutilate

Sharpened razor
Takes your head
Jugulator

Predit hater
You are trapped
Decimate

Desecrator
Your neck snapped
Jugulator

Jugulator he is near
Attracted by the stench of fear
Part demonic part machine
Hungry and it's time to feed

Iron claws and fangs of steel
Dripping from his tasty meal
Now it's time to jugulate
Feel your skull disintegrate

Jugulator killing time now
Reaches in and rips your spine out

Violator
Big mistake
Mutilate

Vindicator
Rib cage break

Flesh and bones
Are massacred

Jugulator
Desecrator
Jugulator

// Blood Stained //

Atrocities
Made every day
Religiously

Their sins
They hide
Can never disguise
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies

They wage their wars
Such profiteers
Will nail us all

Their crimes
Concealed
Despicably reveal

Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained lies

They fire at will
Intent to kill
They have no conscience
They have no conscience
Ethnic cleansing nothing more!
Blood of nations blood of war

Turn blind eyes
From all your crimes
You bare our souls
Show no remorse
You cannot wash
The bloodstains off

They turn their backs
While others
Commit grisly acts

We're scared
For life
By politicians' greedy

Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained crimes
Blood stained lands
Blood stained minds
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies

And while such predators
Stalk this earth
Disguised as saints
They kill our faith

Obsessed by greed
Lying through their teeth
They cannot wash
The blood stains off

// Dead Meat //

The hangman's noose won't get me
Gas chambers never stress me
The can line me up against the wall

No firing squad will make me
Confess or even break me
I'll stand alone or not at all

I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while I'm living

No surrender
We never will surrender

We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed

No shackles made will chain me
No endless pain will change me
The scars will testify this all

No solitary confinement
Will break my strong resignment
I'll die before I will conform
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while I'm living

No surrender
There'll never be surrender

We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
Read in my obituary
Defiance breeds victory

No cage they make can hold me
No law enforced controls me
No trap that's sprung stops me for long

No prison cell contains me
No snare they set will claim me
Relentlessly I'll fight them all

I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while I'm living

No surrender
We never will
Be driven asunder
No surrender
We never will
Raise the white flag
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed

Indoctrination
Will never
Suppress me
They're seriously mistaken
Cause I'll take them
Down with me
And just before they're finished
They'll scream
Along with me

We are all dead meat

// Death Row //

Let me out
Sorry son
Commit a crime - pay the price

Death row - What's that - 'No stay?'
Oh! Ok I'll tell him

Dead man walking

We've all been detained
For the crimes we've committed
They stayed execution
But we'll never get acquitted
Waiting for the day when they strap us in
And when they pull the lever
Hear the goddamn screams
Shake with fear
Electric chair

We're all inside
Homocide related
They'll show no mercy
But we don't anticipate it
We move a little closer
Every day to meet our maker
They cover up our face
And then they close the circuit breaker
Oh! No!

Shake with fear
Your time draws near
Oh! No! - I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row

Oh come on man
Give me a break
I made one mistake, that's all it takes

I ain't that bad
I ain't done nothing wrong

Shake with fear
The end is near

Oh! No! - I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh! No! - They're taking me slow
One way ticket to death row

So what's the matter son
Too young to die
Take it like a man
Don't cry Ah! Ah!

Ahh!

Oh! No! - I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row

Say a prayer, best beware
It's not very nice in the electric chair

Oh! No! - I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row

Oh! No! - They're taking me slow
One way ticket to death row

// Decapitate //

Your head
You will lose it

Severed
When executed

You always thought
You'd never get caught

Decapitate
Sealing your fate

Rebels
Futile efforts

Are quelled
With effective measures

The sentence is read
Word that you dread

Decapitate
Walk through hell's gate

You've lost your head sir
Well you will tomorrow - sleep well

This court's
Best deterrent

To set
New precendents

The verdict of course
Couldn't be worse

Decapitate
Example be made

Decapitate
Will seal your fate

// Burn In Hell //

Speak to me
Of those days I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned - to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else I can do
But one's thing's certain
I'm coming back for you

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who you used it on
It's time to burn in hell

Say my name
I can hear you whisper
Not to blame?
You are going to blister
Scream in the night
I've been counting the days
It's so amusing
To see you again

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Die
Why?
Time to pay the price

Kill
I will
Have my sacrifice

Plead
With fear
I am getting near

Friend
Liar
Time to eat some fire

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Burn in hell
Burn in hell

Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in hell

Burn in hell
Burn in hell

Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're gonna love me

Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Burn in hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in hell
Burn

// Brain Dead //

Turn me off
Pull the plug
Leave me with some dignity

I am not
What I was
And I don't need the sympathy

Alive inside me
No one can hear me

Brain dead
I'm not
Brain dead
Sentenced
Forgot

Paralysed
In my shell
Enduring every
Endless day

Immobilized
On my back
Aware of everything
They say

Extricate me
Eliminate me

Brain dead
I'm not
Brain dead
Drip fed
Forgot

I can't blink my eye or cry
Or even speak
They crowd around my bed
Condescending words are said
Thinking I don't hear or know
What is going on - Hello!
Can't you suckers hear my cries
From inside I'm still alive
It's my decision to abort
Turn off the goddamn life support

Let me pass
From this world
So I fade away in peace

Comprehending
Unrelenting

Brain dead
I'm not
Brain dead
Sentenced
Forgot

Brain dead
I'm not
Brain dead
Drip fed forgot

// Abductors //

Abductors - they come at night

They come at night and they infiltrate you
The paralyse and they mentally rape you
Expressionless they disintegrate you
The probe your soul and desecrate you

Abductors - will bleed your mind
Abductors - cutting inside
They come for you in the night

They strap you in-struments laid before you
And powerless begin to explore you
You scream in pain but they just ignore you
They bring machines and they drill and bore you

Abductors - cutting inside
Abductors - drinking your mind

No-one believes that you
Were chosen from few
Defiled and abused
By alien rituals

You wake in fright there in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment

Abductors - will bleed your mind
Abductors - cutting inside
They come for you in the night

They send you back and disorientate you
A lesser race they discriminate you
Whatever said will incriminate you
No-one believes

The sceptics laugh an annihilate you
They dig you out and they excavate you
Authority and even God forsakes you
No-one believes

Hey maybe I am just a liar

// Bullet Train //

Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the night before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding - cannot stand the strain

With each new mile
They death defy me
Standing on trial
Scrutinize me

And questionize my

Strong denial

Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Windows illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Freefall as I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies

Changing my course
Blurred and scorched
Breathing exhaust
As we distort

By gravity

Of such G-force

Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Freefall but never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within

Wanting much more
I implore you
Near to death's door
To ignore

The screams of all

Who fall before

Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Bullet

// Cathedral Spires //

They have blown away the daylight
Hours we had
Left a legacy, a deadly aftermath
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands
As we spiral down into oblivion
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight
We shall never see another setting sun
Time to rise up and ascend, the end has come

No more willpower
Choked by hell fire

Darkness above
Blackening out the sun
Gripped by steel claws
Corrosion eating us

So before we're all devoured
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From amongst the clouds
In cathedral spires

No names
No graves

No prayers
Can save us

Ashes to dust
Doomsday's upon us now

It cannot be stopped
Genocide all is lost

Oh! We're so tired
Time to rise up and conspire in
Cathedral spires
Watching as our world expires
From up above the clouds
In cathedral spires

Jaws of corruption
Swallow us as one
Consuming every nation
Evoke resistance getting none
Complete disintegration
No good to defend
There can be but one outcome
We are no more - ascend

Vaporized fury
Offers no sanctuary
Oh! We're so tired
Time to rise up and retire
Watching as the world expires
From up above the clouds
In cathedral
In cathedral spires

Oh! We're so tired
Watching the world expire
Time that we retired
Up in cathedral spires
