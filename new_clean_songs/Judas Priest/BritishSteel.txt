// Breaking The Law //

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

You don't know what it's like

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Breaking the law

// Metal Gods //

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own

Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart

From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease

Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes

Metal Gods
Metal Gods

Metal Gods
Metal Gods

Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand

Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

// Grinder //

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line

Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back

Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught

Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere

Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game

Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land

As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

// United //

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin

We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here

Gonna keep on driving
Never stop

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win

We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here

Gonna keep on driving
Never stop

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

So keep it up

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all

// Living After Midnight //

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
[repeat and fade]

// You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise //

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you

The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife

I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise

No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had

The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free

I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise

I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise

I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own

I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice

You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise

// The Rage //

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone

Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave

When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

// Steeler //

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack

Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like

Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you

Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

// Red, White And Blue //

When I'm far away
And I can't get through
Wherever I roam
This piece of home
Keeps bringing me back to you

Holding on to hope
There's no need to fear
Wherever I roam
This piece of home
Keeps telling you that I'm near

So lift up your heart
Cause the brave will always come through
While we're apart
We will raise the red, white and blue

When I stand alone
Without you by my side
I think of all
That you stand for
It fills me up with pride

Reaching out to you
Across mountains, sea and sky
I think of all
That you stand for
And hope will never die

Now I'm coming home again
I'm coming home to you
And as I roam
This piece of home
Has brought me back to you

// Grinder (Live) //

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to bend the arrow out of line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back

Grinder - looking for the meat
Grinder - wants you to eat

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies on my scene this boy won't get caught
Refuse to bait the man trap
Be left to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat

I have my licence
It came with birth
For self reliance of this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched to file me in your game

Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
On the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I nee d room to breath
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat
Grinder - looking for meat
Grinder - wants you to eat
