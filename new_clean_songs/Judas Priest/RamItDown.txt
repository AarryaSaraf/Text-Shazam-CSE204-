Album: RamItDown

// Ram It Down //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware

Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave

Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there

To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down

// Heavy Metal //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions

It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want

Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision

An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking

Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want

// Love Zone //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild

Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed

Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy

I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light

You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car

Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy

In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you

When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes

Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy

Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Wo oh, love zone
Live that fantasy

Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

// Come And Get It //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean

Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar

Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound

Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it

Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night

Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on

Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound

Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it loud

If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Come and get it

// Hard As Iron //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive

Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel

Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice

Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel

As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain

Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel

// Blood Red Skies //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow

If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting

Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night

Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice

Not begging you
I'm telling you

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies

Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise

Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night

They're closing in
They'll never win

You won't break me
You won't take me
You won't make me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies

As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
just I'll face you under
blood red skies

You'll never take me alive
I'm telling you
Hands of justice
I will stand, I will fight
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

// I'm A Rocker //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone

I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything

I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
And no one can take that away

Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give

I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back

I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
And no one can take that away

I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I'm a rocker
I can never get enough
I'm a rocker
It's something in my blood
I'm a rocker
Wouldn't change it even if I could

I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
And no one can take that away

// Johnny B. Goode //

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods amongst the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
That never ever learned to read and write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Old engineer sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would stop and say
"Oh my but how that little country boy could play"

Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights, saying
Johnny B. Goode tonight

Go go. Go Johnny go
Johnny B. Goode

// Love You To Death //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head

Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care

I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death

I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease

Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care

I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death

You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death

// Monsters Of Rock //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand

From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a

Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop

Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for

And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a

Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop

From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a

Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
Impossible to stop

// Night Comes Down (Live) //

In the last rays of the setting sun
And the past days, that's where our
memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Oh no you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no say it isn't true
Can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two

// Bloodstone (Live) //

I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me
Out of my mind

I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing it's sense
Of all kind

How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone, bloodstone

In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played

Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made

How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone, bloodstone

Bloodstone
I can't take it
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that that bloodstone
