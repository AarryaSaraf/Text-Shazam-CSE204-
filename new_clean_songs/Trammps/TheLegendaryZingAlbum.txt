// Penguin At The Big Apple / Zing Went The Strings Of My Heart (Medley) //

Ha, look here, mm hmm
Strings of my heart, baby
Sing for you

Dear, when you smiled at me (Mm hmm)
I heard a melody (Yeah)
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me (Mm hmm)
Started a symphony (Honey)
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Whoa, like a breath of spring
I heard a robin sing, yes I did
About a nest in the park
Ooh, baby, everything seemed to be
In perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Listen to me now

Heh
Lord, have mercy
Hit me, fellas
Heh, it's alright
Sock it to 'em
Mm hmm, honey, honey, it's alright, ooh
It's alright

I still recall that thrill
I guess I always will
I hope we'll never ever part (Never ever part, honey)
Dear, with your lips to mine (Mm hmm)
A rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Huh, listen to me now

Ow, it's alright, uh huh, honey
Every day, baby, baby, baby
Sing for you, ow
It's alright, huh
Mm hmm, honey
Let me sing about my baby
Every day, ow, ow, ow
It's alright, huh
Mm hmm, honey
That's alright, baby
Oh yeah, oh
Early in the morning
Midnight hour, baby
Sing about my baby
Every day, oh

// Sixty Minute Man //

Look-ee here girls I'm telling you now
They call me Lovin' Dan
I rock'em, roll'em all night long
I'm a sixty minute man

If your man ain't treatin' you right
Come on and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry
"Oh yes, he's a sixty minute man!"

If you don't believe I'm all I say
Come up and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry
"Oh yes, he's a sixty minute man!"

// Rubber Band //

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(That's what you did to me baby)
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(Listen to me)

Like the bird yeah, with a broken wing, honey
I picked you up yeah, and made you sing again, yes I did
And now baby, you're back up on your feet
All you want to do baby, is run the street, but listen
You knew, it wouldn't last forever
It's gonna take some time, to pull myself together, oh

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(Listen, I'm gonna tell the world about you)

You gave me love, then you broke my heart, yes you did
Took all my dreams, and tore them all apart honey
Do you recall baby? Did you forget Honey?
I dried your eyes, on the days that they were wet, But listen
You knew, it wouldn't last forever
It's gonna take some time, to get myself together, yeah
(It's alright, oh I'll get over it baby)
You knew, it wouldn't last forever
I'm gonna take some time, and get myself together, cause

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(Everyday Yeah)
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(That's all right baby)
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(That's what you did to be baby)
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(I picked you up when you were down and out baby, but that's alright)
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
(That's what you did to me baby, That's what you did to me baby)
Stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
Stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
Stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
Stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand

// Hold Back The Night //

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby
(Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby

When you left you took the sun right out of the sky
(Oh yes, you did)
Wondered why you went away, never told me why
When the sun goes down and the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby
(Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights

Loneliness is haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book, in a book that I read
When the sun goes down the moon is near
Scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby
