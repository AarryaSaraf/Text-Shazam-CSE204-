Album: Junk

// Do It, Try It //

Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

Listen to the sound
Of a new tomorrow
Take over my dreams
Walk into the feeling

A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat

Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it

Listen to the sound
Like a shout in the night
Moving at the tempo
Of a broken song

A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat

Listen to the sound
Of a broken heart
Calling for a sign of love
Heal me up (try it, do it)
Back me down (try it, do it)
Turn me on (try it, do it)
And I'm alone (do it)

A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat

Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone
Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone
Try it all
Do it, try it
Do it
Try it

// Go! //

You, you, you, meet me, me, me
At this station, station
Can't, can't, can't, get used, used, used
To patience, patience
Wish time, this time
Could just be a bit shortened, shortened
Be-be-be-be-tween u-u-us
Six million seasons

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

F-F-Feels like we-we-we'll be frozen, frozen
N-N-Need you to-to tell me "Je t'aime", "Je t'aime"
Full speed cause we gotta look to discover, cover
G-G-Get me j-j-just a little closer

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

I'm gonna come, just meet me there
Gonna come straight away
It all starts with we
Gonna find you in the night
Gonna make it or die
Gonna come straight away
It all starts with we
Gonna find you
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

I loved, I loved
Ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

// Walkway Blues //

Taking a foreign flight
Looking for signs of life
When you flashed upon my screen
Testing the atmosphere
Your silhouette appears
And I know I'm not alone

But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name

I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass simulacra

I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of days

I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

// Bibi The Dog //

Svelte, long et stable, comme portant le ciel
Sur ses fines échasses, cet homme semble irréel.
Ses cheveux et sa barbe sont d'un rouge épais
Le bout des ses doigts parle quand sa bouche se tait.

A ses frêles épaules, structure organique
Des formes accrochées, des étoffes moirées,
Des plumes, des galons, des perles véridiques

Heya
I'm walkin' to the beat
Right now
I'm talking to the street
And now
I'm burning in the heat
Il est ce soir un roi, demain sera Ganesh
Hier était Héra version extra-terrestre.
Il invente des savants, des dictateurs, des djinns
Les fait vivre immobiles, l'oeil perçant, sublimes.

Il ne faut qu'une nuit, dans un lieu insolite
Pour repérer l'oiseau, rencontre électrique.

Heya
I'm walkin' to the beat
Right now
I'm talking to the street
And now
I'm burning in the heat

Heya
I'm rocking to the beat
Right now
I get to the place we meet
And now
We're burning in the heat

Heya
I'm walkin' to the beat
Right now
I'm talking to the street
And now
I'm burning in the heat

Heya
I'm rocking to the beat
Right now
I get to the place we meet
And now
We're burning in the heat

Heya
I'm walkin' to the beat
Right now
I'm talking to the street
And now
I'm burning in the heat

// For The Kids //

[Susanne Sundfør:]
Where are you now?
Who do you go to for a shoulder to cry on?
I hope that some day you might turn around and come back home

Where are you now?
When will I see your face again?
No matter how far apart we become you know that I'll still hear your song

[Monolouge - Zelly Meldal-Johnsen:]
This is the day. This is our day, mom
If we believe it, it will happen
I am everywhere, you remember?
I'm in the water, on the mirror
The strange flower you saw in the forest
I'm the morning dust tickling your neck
I am the wind, mommy
And the wind is never sad...
He's brave, and soft, and furious sometimes
Soon I'll be strong enough to make you fly with me
And nothing will ever stop us then

[Susanne Sundfør:]
I don't know when I'll see you again
But I know that my love will last for eternity
I'll wait till the stars go dark for you to come back to me

// Solitude //

Somewhere
Back in time
I left a part of me
I wanna see if you can try
To bring it back to me

You've got to go
Where I cry
And take in all the tears
I wanna see if you can try
Drink a little bit of me

No
No

Just a little lonely
Where I am
Take me back in time
I wanna see if you can smile
If I become a better man

I need you
Now I know
Just give me one more chance
I'm gonna try and be your friend
So we can beat the end

No
No

No
No

// Laser Gun //

Small town, too hot
I'm going for a trip
A place where dreams are made like comic strips
I see colours and planes, laser guns and champagne
I feel strong and smart, ready for a new start
It got me too

And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it

So let's go and get it
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing

Now my blood is gone
And my face is drawn
Seven legs on top
And my heart just popped
People love me though
I'm their new Rambo
This is my kingdom
A different kind of home
You got me too

And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it

So let's go and get it
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

All you can do is keep dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning
All you can do is keep dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need

Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down
Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down

// Road Blaster //

I was driving at the dawn
But everywhere I go, everywhere I go I see you
Calling love to the land
'Cause anything I do, anything I do
Is about you

I was searching at the speed of sound
And I go up and down until I hit the ground

I need someone

I was falling through the universe
I went forward and reverse
To forget about you

Now you get me
Just another soul to break
Evil is God and I'm going straight to Hell

// Atlantique Sud //

Sans moteur
Comment veux-tu que j'avance?
J'ai perdu ton visage

J'ai pas peur
Et si jamais tout s'efface
Je saurais a nouveau tout redessiner

Allez viens tu peux bien prendre l'avion demain
J'ai perdu l'habitude des gens qui pensent a moi
Je t'attends dans le noir

N'aie pas peur
Oui je te suis
Je prends de l'altitude
Je pense toujours a toi
Attends-moi dans le noir

N'aie pas peur
Si tu ne vois que du vide
Je viens te chercher

J'ai le coeur
Qui invente des souvenirs
Tu pourrais a nouveau tout redessiner

Allez viens tu peux bien prendre l'avion demain
J'ai perdu l'habitude des gens qui pensent a moi
Je t'attends dans le noir

N'aie pas peur
Oui je te suis
Je prends de l'altitude
Je pense toujours a toi
Attends-moi dans le noir

Allez viens tu peux bien prendre l'avion demain
Je reprends l'habitude de toi qui penses a moi
Je t'attends dans le noir

// Time Wind //

Wake me up from the long way that we've come
Just to find out that it's all been said and done
But we'll do it again and say it's all in our heads

Something automatic when you speak before you think
And you walk beside yourself to pass the time
If you never play the game you never lose anyway

See the photograph on an empty wall
Pictures of a life I can't call my own
I need a love that won't do me wrong
Waiting for the sound of a false alarm
The pictures all that I know

So afraid to unravel what we've made
Out of everything that changed before our eyes
You see the turning of the tide will bring us back to the shore

Take a photograph when it starts to fade to black
Someday you might never know if I was there
It's the harder that you try that makes it hard to let go

See the photograph on an empty wall
Pictures of a life I can't call my own
I need a love that won't do me wrong
Waiting for the sound of a false alarm
The pictures all that I know

See the photograph
Are the pictures real?
See the photograph
Are the pictures real?
Want the pictures to be real
Want the pictures

// Sunday Night 1987 //

Lost memories
Faded pictures
Can you drive me back
To this very moment

Julia
Alexander
Where did you all go?
Love

Old memory
From the limbo
From the night

Lost memory
Coming back
Remember the sun
Remember the colors

Julia
Alexander
Let me feel you all
Love
