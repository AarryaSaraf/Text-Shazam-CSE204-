// Concentration (Ver 1) //

Holy holy, hmm, holy holy

It started settle down in the drag to concentrate
And getting a weekly pay instead of begging every day
Father gave us every little thing to make us try
And help ourselves and He said He'd help those
Who try to help their selves

So if you want to be in that situation
Change your evil ways and join this congregation
And maybe you'll soon be living like the King
That sitteth on His throne
If happiness is far away, it will show up some day

Holy holy, holy holy

If you want to live that independent life
Go out and do the work instead of being in a fight
Father knows that you're the chosen one
To perform His works
And you'll be repaid in His holy way

In His holy way, yeah, yeah
In His holy way, yeah, holy way, yeah, holy way

// Silhouettes //

Silhouette...

Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within the dim light cast, two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
I wondered why I'm not a man, whose silhouettes on the shade
I couldn't hide those tears in my eyes

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

It's true... oh yeah

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block

Ran down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days two silhouettes on the shade

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Must come to your house with wings, on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved, you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...

Silhouette...

// He Can't Spell //

You think [?] in a conversation
And you sure to be an illiterate boy
'Cause you could not spell your name

Although your mind is deserted
You replied this is bad
You're no good for me
Though I accept your apology

I keep telling you
That discipline yourself
And you say that's nonsense
So I won't say anything at all

But remember wherever you go
You're not to speak aloud in a crowd
'Cause you might be ashamed of yourself

'Cause I keep telling you
That disciple yourself
And you say that's nonsense
So I won't say anything at all

You're just standing different
You're not the type I run to

I keep telling you
To discipline yourself
My brother
And you people say

// Musical Heatwave //

Now listen to my story
And sing a long with me

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

When summer comes along
You can hear the children sing the song
When summer comes along
You can see the preacher men drinking rum

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

The breeze starts blowin'?
You can hear it rustlin? through the trees
You'll also hear the [?] sounds
You really, really want to sing along

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

If you're feeling sad and low
There's one thing that you should know
That even the birds
Are happy to sing along with me

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'
It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

It's comin'?, it's comin'?
The musical heatwave, it's comin'

// Lips Of Wine //

Well, I've been thinking lately much of my baby
Thinking how she needs me, yeah
And I don't see you know if she's feeling so bad
Feeling so bad, feeling so bad

Maybe it's better
If I forget her
Let her go on

How I long to hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine

Maybe it's better if
I forget her
Let her go on

How I long to her hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine

// Let Me Down Easy //

Wooh Yeah

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmhmmm

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmmhmmm

Break it to me gently
If htis is goodbye
(Baby say it slow)
Cause you taught me to love you
So come on girl and teach me not to love you before you go
Oh cause the fall from the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop

So let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmmhmm

Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmhmmm

Don't turn the lights out on me
Let the fell of love slowly fade away
Let your sweeter sister know
And you're loving arms a little tender day by day
Oh cause the fall
From the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop

So let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby

Let me down easy
Give me time to get over you baby
Let me down easy
Give me a lil love girl
Give me time to get over you
Just a little more time
Let me down easy baby

// Changing Times //

Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Now that the change has come
We must have some fun

Watching the kids playing on the lawn
They're looking gay as the bright sun shines
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one

We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one

Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
