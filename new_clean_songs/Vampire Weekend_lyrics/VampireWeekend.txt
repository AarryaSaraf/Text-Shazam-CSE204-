// Mansard Roof //

I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet
Is a nautically mapped sheet
As thin as paper while it slips away from view

// Oxford Comma //

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

// A-Punk //

Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh

A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh

I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!

// Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa //

As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother on a sandy lawn
As a sophomore with reggaeton
And the linens you're sittin' on

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Can you stay up to see the dawn?
In the colors of Benetton

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you wanna, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

// M79 //

It's gonna take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79
Wasted days, you've come to pass
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

Ohh, ohh

You walk up the stairs, see the French kids by the door
Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor
Coronation rickshaw grab
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

Ohh, ohh

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass

// Campus //

I wake up, my shoulders cold
I've got to leave here, before I go
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor

Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

Walk to class in front of ya
Spilled kefir on your keffiyeh
You look inside and turn to the door
Drag your feet along the floor

Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class

In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class

// Bryn //

Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland, a feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do

Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

Nights by the ocean, a westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull, no Kansas-born beetle
Could ever come close to that free

Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

// One (Blake's Got A New Face) //

Occident out on the weekend
That's the way that we relax
English Breakfast tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute to even ask

Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

Nastiness will cause your doom
Turn and walk back to your room

The precedent's already set now
You spend a week in Old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along

Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

Majesty's not overheard
Cryptographs can't stand the word

Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

Oh, your collegiate grief has left you
Dowdy in sweatshirts, absolute horror

// I Stand Corrected //

You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway

I stand corrected
I stand corrected

No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony

I stand corrected
I, oh, I stand corrected

Lord knows I haven't tried
I'll take my stand
One last time

Forget the protocol
I'll take your hand
Right in mine

I stand corrected
I, oh, I stand corrected

// Walcott //

Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Mystic Seaport is that way
Don't you know that your life could be lost
Out of Cape Cod tonight?

Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, the bottleneck is a shit show
Hyannisport is a ghetto
Out of Cape Cod tonight

The lobster's claw is sharp as knives
Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you

Walcott, all the way to New Jersey
All the way to the Garden State
Out of Cape Cod tonight
Walcott, fuck the women from Wellfleet
Fuck the bears out in Provincetown
Heed my words and take flight

Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?

Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?

// The Kids Don't Stand A Chance //

A devastating backstroke
All the way from France
With shiny, shiny cufflinks
A shirtsleeve to enhance

The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
With pure Egyptian cotton
The kids don't stand a chance

You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
Forty-million dollars
The kids don't stand a chance

I didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance

The pin-striped men of morning
The partners in the dance
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance

// Ladies Of Cambridge //

Chestnut vibes on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin' alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hands
The ladies of Cambridge know who I am

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

Graveyard bricks will fall into style
Lady as Pharaoh, Charles as the Nile
That's a museum, price you could pay
Stones of your fathers stand there today

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night

'Cause when you left my room to go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid streak runs through the whole of my family
But for you, I could put it to rest

But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take

// Arrows //

I saw you down at the station
Your leather suitcase burst at the seams
Stay all day up in your rooms now
That's not a problem you've ever seen

Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

I awoke up in a bedroom
You'd gone out hunting, I was asleep
Spend my day out at the fountain
That's not a problem you had foreseen

Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

Oh, it's no use at all
But that life in the church could still remain
