// 25/8 //

My friends are calling, since the morning
They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin', but the only thing missin' is my clothes, my clothes

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8

Calling insomnia, but this is just the thing that I like
'Cause when you're on me, I get hungry, got a big appetite
Wanna feel the rush, runnin' through my blood
Baby, don't open the blinds, all night

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

I gon' need all the extra hours
You and me all up in this room
You gon' need all the extra powers
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

We gon' need all the extra hours
To do the things I want to do
We gon' need all the extra powers
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom, zoom)

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way

// Act Of God //

Wait a minute, uh

You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don't care
I'm so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I'm a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared

Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I'm so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

Act of God, don't know how it started
Now I'm boutta lose at all, but I can't control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won't be safe
'Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, 'cause I can't control it
Wait a minute, uh

I'm lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
'Cause all this divine intervention
I'm starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn't ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)

Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I'm so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you
(You-ooh)

Act of God, don't know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can't control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won't be safe
'Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, 'cause I can't control it
Wait a minute, uh

I'm scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It's my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can't explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

Act of God, don't know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can't control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won't be safe
'Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, 'cause I can't control it
Wait a minute, uh

I'm lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

// Afterlight //

Fill me up
So close I've got you face to face
Playing rough
Can't help it when you say my name

I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin

Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight

Silhouettes
And shadows moving in our bed
Take a guess
Tell me what you think happens next

I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin

Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight

Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side
Afterlight, better do me right
Afterlight, need you by my side

Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight, dirty dancing in the dark tonight

// All Or Nothing //

While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of hope and dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me, are we meant to be?

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time (time, time)
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Don't you beg me for forgiveness
Don't mistake my love for weakness

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

// All To Myself //

Feels like we're all alone, but we're here in a crowded room
Your eyes all on me, and my eyes are looking right at you
Feels like I've known you for a lifetime, but it's just day two
So into you (So into you)

Something about you in the way that you just say my name
It makes me wanna throw my hands up 'cause you know I'm game
Wanna unlock the movies I got playing in my brain (In my brain)
Of you, and me (Of you, and me)

Honestly, for you, there's no one but me
And honestly, I want you

I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself

All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

Up in the canyon with the flowers, they were all in bloom
Your hand on the lower part of my back, so close to you
You know the feeling when you're falling?
Well, I fell for you (I fell for you)
You know it's true (You know it's true)

Honestly, for you, there's no one but me
And honestly, I want you

I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

Baby, I say goodbye to all the rest

You're the one that gets me best
Only, only one, only, only one
Baby, just say goodbye to all the rest
'Cause I'm the one that gets you best
Only, only one, only, only one

Honestly, for you, there's no one but me
And honestly, I want you

I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

Baby, I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)
You're the one that gets me best (Ooh-ooh)
Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)
Baby, I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)
You're the one that gets me best (Ooh-ooh)
Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh-ooh, ooh...

// Bad Idea //

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

Will you protect me from the things that I want?
Will you be down and leave the second we're done?
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong

But I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun

'Cause I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
(I got a bad idea, ha)

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

No, I can't help myself (Ah)
Haha

I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I don't care because I like it (I like it)
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
But I won't stop because I like it

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself

(I got a bad idea)

It's a bad idea (No, no, no)
But I can't help myself (Help myself), no, I can't help myself (Help myself)

It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself (Help myself), so I'll just help myself to you

Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

Why's it so much better when we're not together? (Not together)
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
(I got a bad idea)

// Ball And Chain //

Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Ooh)
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you)

It ain't about the money, don't matter where you're from
Don't care 'bout what you believe in
Or who you wanna love
Let's get back to basics, before we turn to dust
Forget about all the illusions
Tonight it's us

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Sweat drippin' out our body, that's how we shed our pain
The monsters waiting outside, like poison for the brain
Things get a little bit crazy, don't need to feel ashamed
There's no more time for cryin'
You can be our DJ
Play our worries away
You can be our savior
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Trapped inside the rhythm world, I feel free
Let me be your prisoner
Suffocated by the beat, lets me breathe
Keep on lightin' me up, keep on lightin' it up

Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you, need you)
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Hang on)
How we dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Hang on)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

// Bang Bang //

I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'till this day I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Oh, ooh
My baby shot me down

Ah-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down
Shot me down
Shot me down, down, down, down, down

// Berlin Summer //

We're kissin' on the concrete floor
The third day of the rave
Berlin summer, I knew I loved you then
Fireworks lit the sky
We're runnin' through a burnin' field
Baby, just you and I

If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah

I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

We're runnin' down the country road in 2018
It was only you and me
And nothin' in between (Oh I, oh yeah)
And the trees are movin', in slow motion
Drunk and dancin'

If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah

I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah (uh)
Oh yeah, hmm
Oh yeah, yeah (uh)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, hmm
Berlin summer
Berlin summer

If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
Oh yeah

I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you

Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, yeah)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, hmm)

// Between A Bullet And Heartbreak //

You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends

Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Cosmic
She's cosmic
Cosmic

Ooh
I must have died and gone to Heaven

[Dua Lipa:]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've

// CAN THEY HEAR US //

Every breath that I'm takin', every step that I'm makin'
Ain't no way I can run without you
Every ghost in my past life held my hand when I crashed down
Carries me when I wanna break through

We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us? (Ooh)

Anywhere that I turn to got me goin' in circles
No matter what, I'll make sure we get out

'Cause we all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
They been on my mind, maybe I'm delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?

Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious (Blame it on delirious)
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')

// Cocoa Butter Kisses //

Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, yeah, know you still remember me

Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel

Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug then pass
Then pass

I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah

// Cold Heart (PNAU Remix) //

(Oh)
(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)

[Elton John:]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Dua Lipa:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)

// Dance The Night //

Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Pull my outfits up tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

Lately I've been moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missing no steps

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They'll never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play it safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Ah-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing like diamonds on my face
I still keep the party going, not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)
Even when the tears are flowing like diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)
I still keep the party going, not one hair out of place

Watch me dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face
Watch me (Dance) dance, dance the night away (Ah-huh)
I still keep the party running, not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They'll never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play it safe, don't you know about me? (Ah-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

// Electricity //

Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel when I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see through

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
(Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny)

All I see is you, lately
Wide awake in and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
(Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny)

I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know, ooh
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity, I'm falling in to you
I feel electric, baby (I want it, I need it)
So electric, baby (this current between us)
Wanna let you know, let you know (this flow, this feeling)
I think I'm ready, baby (I want it, I need it)
I think I'm ready, now (this current between us)
Electricity, I'm falling in to you (this flow, this feeling)

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

// For Julian //

What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear? What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone but we can swim together

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

// Good Things //

Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now (Oh)
Baby, turn the lights down
Down, down, down, down
Do it for me right now
Now, now, now, now

Heavy like the bass-line
Way past "Good Girl" bed time
Had too much, drunk as fuck
Swaying to those red lights
On my worst behavior
Making out with strangers
Dusty buzz, feel the rush
Speeding through my head

I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It's all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It's all over me

Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)

Dirty like the dance-floor
Psychedelic candy store
In a transe, dizzy stance
I got what you're looking for
Naughty indication, give into temptation
Late at night, what a high
When we conversate

I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It's all over me
I can feel it coming over me
Can you feel it? It's all over me

Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)

Good things, good things
Happen past midnight, midnight (Oh)
Good things, good things
Happen before sunrise, sunrise
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now
Baby, turn the lights down
Lights down, lights down
Do it for me right now
Right now, right now (Oh)

// Guilty //

(Guilty, guilty, guilty)

Took myself out for dancing, a little romancing
I'm learning to be alone
Left that sadness behind me, won't let it define me
I'm on my own, no

I don't have to tell you where I'm going
Who I'm going with or when I'll be back home
Back home

Feeling guilty 'cause I feel so good
'Cause I feel so good
Guilty 'cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn't feel so guilty
'Cause I did no wrong, I'm just having fun
You're the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I'm the guilty one
(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

We could blame it on timing, if that justifies it
But we have to let go
This new rhythm I'm finding
Is helping me find me
I hope you do too

You don't have to tell me where you're going
Who you're going with or when you'll be back home
Back home

Oh, I'm feeling guilty 'cause I feel so good
'Cause I feel so good
Guilty 'cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn't feel so guilty
'Cause I did no wrong, I'm just having fun
You're the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I'm the guilty one

(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

Feeling guilty 'cause I feel so good
'Cause I feel so good
Guilty 'cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn't feel so guilty
'Cause I did no wrong, I'm just having fun
You're the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I'm the guilty one
Feeling guilty 'cause I feel so good
'Cause I feel so good
Guilty 'cause I feel so good
I know I shouldn't feel so guilty
'Cause I did no wrong, I'm just having fun
You're the one that pulled the plug
Somehow I'm the guilty one

(Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty)

// High //

You don't have to be so cautious
If you practice what you preach
Counting up the stacks on the counter
A fucking (disease)
Don't ask me to be righteous
If you practice what you teach
Counting all your blessings
The second you're down on your knees

So why, why?
Don't we get a little high, high?

Don't we get a little
Get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high

Keep my head under the water, pride buried in my chest
Not counting all the minutes, the seconds, not holdin' my breath
Now sinkin' from the surface, swimmin' in my lungs
Losing all my vision, religion, I'm holdin' my tongue

So why, why?
Don't we get a little high, high?

Don't we get a little
Get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high

Don't want to pay attention
To the writing on the wall
Painted with aggression
And dripping when you call
Not gonna learn my lesson
Am I running out of time?
So why?
Why?
Why?

Don't we get a little
Get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high

// IDGAF (Diablo Remix) //

[Dua Lipa:]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Rich Brian:]
Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?"
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck

[Dua Lipa:]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

// IDGAF (Remix) //

[Saweetie:]
I've been winning since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you about to get much sicker
Cause I'm looking in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Beggin' baby, hands is poppin', wrists with six plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, taking meetings in L.A
Glowing up and blowing up, that's what I'm about to do
When it's all been happening since I left you

[Dua Lipa:]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Saweetie:]
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, and I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept a hundred, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realize you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur

[Dua Lipa:]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

// Jealousy //

The more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back

You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial (Denial, denial)
And I'm so over you (You)
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

It's you and your ego that's fighting for the crown
Maybe that is just your insecurity
I gave you attention, left nothing for myself
And you threw it all away, and I said "Fuck that" (Fuck that)
Fuck that

You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're being jealous

Huh, turn it louder
Jealous, so jealous
You so jealous
Owww!

You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
It's runnin' crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

// Kiss And Make Up //

[Dua Lipa:]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control

Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

I've been drinking
Maybe that's, maybe that's why I'm feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Every time that you're next to me
I'm losing patience
So can we go, can we go all night long?

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Take the tension and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

// Lose Myself //

And I keep saying that I love you
I wish you would listen

But there's something missin', mmh

You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow

Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?

// Love Is Religion //

I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
That one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms, 'cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need (Need)
They say love is religion (Oh-oh, whoa)
So say a prayer with me
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Love is a religion!

// New Rules For COVID Dating //

What a year for dating, crazy
Nothin' is the way it was
People textin' exes sex pics
From the basement at their mom's

If you have human contact
Don't know what you'll contract
So your first date's always on Zoom (Oh)
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy

There's no bars, there's no school
Poundin' claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friends

No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When you've gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime

Now you're lookin' ready
Though, it's low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol (Oh)

If you're ever gonna see another person's body
[?] your forehead, you're a total hottie

Wear a mask, wash your hands
It's not like you have other plans
It's awkward, but it's cool
Following all these COVID rules (COVID rules)

One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Start the Instagram
Got a background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin' game
No one's seen you naked since February
And if you hate it all, watch out if you start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new fanbase, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two: Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans

We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for dating

// New York (Mend My Broken Heart) //

Your kiss, your touch, your hold
You know I want you all
The darkness in my soul tells me to let you go

And I need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy

She never sleeps at night
Some nice you name her twice
Without you, I'm alive
But my heart is cold as ice

And I need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy

I ran away from home
I ran to follow my dream
I ran away from he
Would he do this to me?
I needed a way out
I needed to figure how to get you here with me
Maybe you are my dream, oh

So please, New York (New York, New York)
Mend my broken heart tonight (New York, New York)
Cause I left the one I love
New York, take me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy

Tonight
Tonight

Feel my heartbeat
It's the same old feeling coming over me tonight
Me tonight
Feel it buzzing
Said I'm never gonna call, but tonight, I think I might
Think I might

Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby

Major mistake
No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on the run
On the run
It was heartbreak
I can't stand another day knowing that you are the one
You're the one

Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
Dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby

Real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah
(We got that real groove)

Let's go, ah!
Dua's got that real groove
Kylie
Woo, woo
Real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah
I got that real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
Dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you

// Running //

You, you turned gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it

I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

So watch it blow
When I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake
It'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

// Save Someone //

If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart
I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone
No fight for you
I will fight for you
When you're drowning in your tears and no one answers your prayers
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

(Ooh)
When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you, would you save me tonight?

Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

// Scared To Be Lonely //

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely

// Secrets //

Moving too fast, they say it won't last
But I just wanna, yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
'Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna, ooh

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we've been here before
'Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret

Let me savor all your flavours
And I don't wanna, yeah, I don't wanna share with no one
Feel them watchin', but we ain't talkin'
Boy, I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna, ooh

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we've been here before
'Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret

One day we can tell 'em all
We can tell 'em how
We can tell 'em when
We can tell 'em why
But for now, let's keep it secret
One day we can reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now, let's keep it secret

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret

// Swan Song //

I, I can't lie
I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all
Nothing at all
What is the point of my lips
If they don't make noise, ah
What is the point of doing nothing at all
Watching it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time's running, running out
Only I see all the diamonds, diamonds
Breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low

This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a
Swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a
Swan song, swan song
Swan dive (Yeah)
It's a new life

Real fantasy
Wishing it was make believe
What is the reason of doing nothing at all
Watching it fall

The flicker burning
You know the time's running, running out
Only I see all the diamonds, diamonds
Breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning low

// Talk About It //

Blame it on the night
One too many at the dive
Saw you called a thousand times
Can't talk about it, won't talk about it
Danced until I cried
Took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let's not talk about it, won't talk about it

I'm waking up to messages
Don't recognize the name
I'm wondering who the F it is
'Cause I don't know any Janes
Somebody next to me in my bed
Hold up, wait, this isn't my bed

With someone that I just met (Ah)
And the next thing that I know (I know)
Is I wake up in my clothes (Ah-ah)
And the voice inside my head (My head)
Says never again, again

But you won't, won't, won't

// Thinking 'Bout You (DECCO Remix) //

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

(You, You)
(You, You)

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(I can't stop thinking 'bout youuuuu)
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
(You, You)
(You, You)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

// Voodoo //

I can't get away
Found a home in your heartbeat
I keep coming back again
There's a madness that surrounds me

And when you're a thousand miles away
I'm holding on for you
I get on my knees to pray
Cause I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

You're my heavy rain
You drench me off of nothing
For all you gotta say
At least can you mean something

And when you're a thousand miles away
What am I supposed to do
It's strange cause your love stayed
I've fallen under you

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

(Voodoo, voodoo...)

Why won't you let me go
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out
Why won't you let me go
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out

It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love
Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo

It's your voo...

Is this what they call love

I do, I do, I do what I like
I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do what I like
What I like, I like, I like

No, you can't tell me anything
Do what I wanna do, ooh, ooh, ooh

Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
Daddy, I promise
I'm willing to listen, but the choice is mine
I do, I do, I do what I like
I gotta be honest, I made a decision
And the boy is mine
I made a decision and the boy is mine

// Wicked And Wild //

We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise

Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no

We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Fueled by desire)
Fueled by desire tonight (Fueled by desire)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight

It's a ritual, they call us criminals
Even back in school, individual
You don't wanna see our reality
'Cause the only thing you see in us is enemy

Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no

We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Fueled by desire tonight)
Fueled by desire
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
(Fueled by desire tonight)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)

// Wrong Number //

Stayin' up 'til the AM
Call you out on all your bullshit
Whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff
It was sweet before the fall
You and I got comfortable quick
But whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff

You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

When you're thinking of the end
You're only hearin' me say, "I love ya"
You don't hear the door you slammed after
You remember all the good stuff

You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

(Wrong number)
(Wrong number)

If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (You got the, you know that you got the)
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, boy, na-na-na-na)
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

// Yours //

What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow, ey, ey, ey, ey

Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?

All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (ooh...)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo...

Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be, eh

All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (ooh...)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo...

I wanna be fine
I wanna be that favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (ooh...)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo...
