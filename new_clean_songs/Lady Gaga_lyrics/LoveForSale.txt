// It's De-Lovely //

I feel a sudden urge to sing
The kind of ditty that invokes the Spring
So, control your desire to curse
While I crucify the verse

This verse I've started seems to me
The 'Tin Pan-tithesis' of melody
So, to spare you all the pain
We'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain
Come on

The night is young, the skies are clear
And if you want to go walkin', dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
I understand the reason why
You're sentimental 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

You can tell at a glance
What a swell night this is for romance
You can hear dear mother nature murmuring low
"Let yourself go"

Please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
"It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de-limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely"

You can tell at a glance
What a swell night this is for romance
You can hear dear mother nature murmuring low
"Let yourself go"

So please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
"It's delightful (It's delicious), it's delectable (It's delirious)
It's dilemma, it's de-limit, it's deluxe
It's de-lovely"

// Night And Day //

Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of a stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me

And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Day and night
Night and day
Day and night
Night and day

// Love For Sale //

When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belongs to a lonesome cop, she opens shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk, she goes to work
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample her supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
She's been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love, but true love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy her wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
She's been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy her wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

// Do I Love You //

After that sweet summer afternoon
When for the first time I saw you appear
Dreaming of you, I composed a tune
So will you listen to it, dear?
Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you, do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day
What would life be?
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?
Isn't heaven forever more?
Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do
Just as you love me

Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do
Just as you love
Me

// I've Got You Under My Skin //

I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear

Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

Don't you know, silly fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

And I'll love you like a tattoo under my skin
Under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin

// I Concentrate On You //

Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you
When fortune cries "Nay, nay" to me
And people declare "You're through"
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you
On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine
And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first, my kiss you decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine
And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you

// I Get A Kick Out Of You //

My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
I get a kick out of you

Me? 

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a whirl
I get a kick out of you

Get my kicks out of you

// So In Love //

Strange dear, but true dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me, hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love
Am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love
Am I

// Let's Do It //

When the little bluebird who has never said a word
Starts to sing, "Spring, spring"
When the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring, ding ding

When the little blue clerk, in the middle of his work
Starts a tune to the Moon up above
It is nature, that's all, simply telling us to fall
In love

And that's why birds do it
Bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say, "In Boston, even beans do it"
Let's do it
Let's fall in love, oh

Take it, Brian
Yeah

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em, I know
Why ask if shad do it?
Waiter, bring me Shad Roe

In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

Let's do it
Let's fall in love

// Dream Dancing //

When shades enfold
The sunset's gold
And stars are bright above again
I smile, sweetheart
For then I know I can start
To live again
To love again

When day is gone
And night comes on
Until the dawn, what do I do?
I'll clasp your hand
And wander through slumberland
Dream-dancing with you

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time
Dream-dancing with you

Dream-dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream-dancing
To paradise prancing
Dream-dancing with you

Dream-dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream-dancing
To paradise prancing
Dream-dancing with you

// Just One Of Those Things //

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
It was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit
Of the end of it
When we started to paint that town
We'd have been aware
That our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit
Of the end of it
When we started to paint that town
We'd have been aware
That our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, goodbye dear, and amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

// You're The Top //

At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting 'em off my chest
To let 'em rest unexpressed
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you how great you are

You're the top!
You're the Coliseum
You're the top!
You're the Louvre Museum
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
You're a Bendel bonnet
A Shakespeare's sonnet
You're Mickey Mouse

You're the Nile
You're the Tower of Pisa
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top

You're the top
You're Mahatma Gandhi
You're the top
You're Napoleon Brandy
You're the purple light
Of a summer night in Spain
You're the National Gallery
You're Garbo's salary
You're cellophane

You're sublime
You're a turkey dinner
You're the time of a Derby winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
I'm a total wreck, a flop
I'm an option that no one picked up
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top
