// Bring Em In //

I wasn't looking for you
I wasn't searching
I wasn't creeping around
I wasn't lurking
I wasn't sleeping around
I wasn't thirsting
But, I got a thang for you
I got a thang for you

[Verse 1:]
You on ya job, and it damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you,
Hey baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make ya man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through ya city I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminded me of Friday
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parlay, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room
We call this to the hard way? Hard way!

[Hook:]
I put it down
Any spot any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in [x4]
If they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them

[Verse 2:]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl you lookin' like you knew Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
A stewardess yet you flew the Lear
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for you
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catching bodies
How I'm stretching you there's no need to go to Pilates
When I'm sliding thru ya city meet me in the lobby
Then you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the morning? While you moaning probably
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a high way
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy
Don't mind me, I put it down!

[Hook:]
Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and
Tell a friend, to tell a friend
I put it down!

Any spot, any city that I'm in
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind
So tell a friend, to bring a friend
Bring em in [x4]
If they all bad
You can bring em in
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them

[Verse 3:]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the four seasons
Whisper to ya home girls ya love Cole world
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse
You know the type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf football
I got his girl lip-gloss all on my girth
But cause I'm so cleaver better than who ever
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (ahhhh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's oh eleven, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you so fed up and so I had to blow and I ain't talking
Coke header, I won't let up

[Hook]

// Roll Call //

Just got off the phone my nigger smithy
Shit too real back home, bro. real

This for my niggers here, hold your head
I know shit rough but nigger we don't give up
We don't get mad nigger, we just get tough
We just get right nigger, we don't get left
Fuck what they said,
Cause what we learned coming up
You can't teach that shit
Like dealer nigger blows but we eat that shit
This one here's for my brothers we gonna beat that shit
Now, I say my prayers
I got, too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail, or they're dead right now
One time for my nigger crag right now
He in the feds, damn the times change
And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays
You can keep that shit, I just made a million
Call me when reach that shit
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And a young boy from a show down in hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Didn't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep I suppose
But after a year of review
I figured it out it wasn't me
It was you nigger, congratulations

// Be (Freestyle) //

Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrolls
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rolls
Playing Jigga hits he say "good, make more of those"
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digornoes
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the caine'
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just choosing bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got it coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson uh
Firmative; action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a real nigga til' the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know that I'm paid for this shit, nigga you God damn right
