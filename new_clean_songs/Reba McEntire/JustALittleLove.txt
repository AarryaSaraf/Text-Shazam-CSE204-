// Just A Little Love //

When our check bounces at the store

And the whole world seems at war

You bring me peace of mind once more

With just a little love


When the boss says I'm ten minutes late

And the stack of bills just won't wait

Ooo, you take the worries away

With just a little love


Just a little love

And affection

You bring a touch of perfection

To a world that's sometimes crazy

And so mixed up

Just a little love

You have changed me

You make me see why the good Lord made me

And you can do miracles

With just a little love


When our old car won't run

And all my dreams come undone

You'll make it right won't ya hun

With just a little love


When it seems like all the truths are gone

When I'm trying so hard to hold on

You make it easy to be strong

With just a little love


Just a little love

And affection

You bring a touch of perfection

To a world that's sometimes crazy

And so mixed up

Just a little love

You have changed me

You make me see why the good Lord made me

And you can do miracles

With just a little love

// Poison Sugar //

He's tall dark and dangerous

He's a love thief on the run

He's a moonlight bandit

Brother to the devil's son

He'll cover you with sweet talk

Tell you what you want to hear

Then he'll take your smiling face

And he'll cover it with tears


Oh they call him poison sugar

Cause there's poison in his kiss

Oh you ladies warn your daughters

About the stranger with the poison lips


His hands warm your body like the morning Georgia sun

You'll think you found forever in his arms before he's done

With honey dripping off his words

Your passion takes him home

His lying lips won't tell you

You'll be waking up alone


Oh they call him poison sugar

Cause there's poison in his kiss

Oh you ladies warn your daughters

About the stranger with the poison lips


You could find him on a dark street

You could meet him at the store

He could even wake you up

Knocking on your door

Well, I'm talking from experience

I'm a victim of his kiss

I'm just one of the many

He's loved and left like this


Oh they call him poison sugar

Cause there's poison in his kiss

Oh you ladies warn your daughters

About the stranger with the poison lips


Oh they call him poison sugar

Cause there's poison in his kiss

Oh you ladies warn your daughters

About the stranger with the poison lips


Oh they call him poison sugar

Cause there's poison in his kiss

Oh you ladies warn your daughters

About the stranger with the poison lips

// I'm Gettin' Over You //

I changed my number, bought some new clothes

Got some different records and a new stereo

I'm gettin' over you, I'm gettin' over you


I'm goin' out dancin', learnin' new jokes

I'm stayin' out later than I should I suppose

But, I'm gettin' over you, I'm gettin' over you


I took our name off the mailbox

Redecorated our room

I'm not sayin' the hurtin's all gone

But it'll be gone soon


I'm gettin' over you

So what if you're not here

I'm gettin' over you

And it'll happen one of these years


I ordered make-up from Vogue magazine

I'm takin' aerobics two nights a week

And I'm gettin' over you, oh, I'm gettin' over you


I'm gettin' over you, Mmm, I'm gettin' over you


My friends come over and they'll wonder why

You're picture's back on the wall

It's their proof that losin' you

Don't bother me at all


I'm gettin' over you

So what if you're not here

I'm gettin' over you

And it'll happen one of these years


Yeah, I'm gettin' over you

I'm gettin' over you

I'm gettin' over you

Ooh-ooh I'm gettin' over

I'm gettin' over you...

// You Are Always There For Me //

I know sometimes I'm like a child

I disappoint you so

And how you keep forgiving me

I'll never never know

When I stumble and I fall

And need love desperately

You are always there for me


Like an oak in the wind

Like an old familiar friend

Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea

Darlin' you are always there for me


When I take your love for granted

Like I often do

It's not that I don't need you so

It's not I don't love you

It's just that I'm a fool sometimes

Just too blind to see

That you are always there for me


Like an oak in the wind

Like an old familiar friend

Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea

Darlin' you are always there for me


Like an oak in the wind

Like an old familiar friend

Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea

Darlin' you are always there for me

// Every Second Someone Breaks A Heart //

It's a dangerous world we live in

Crime is everywhere

There's always some sad story going down


You can read it in the paper

You can see it on the air

It's an evil epidemic going round


But nobody seems to notice

The saddest crime of all

Oh just how many times a day

Someone takes their love away

And the national statistics

Never put it in the chart

But every second someone breaks a heart


There's a woman out there somewhere

Who feels she lost her life

But her man just shot her world down

And it hurts


There's a guy who just got taken

And it cuts him like a knife

Some girl stole his heart and left him

Without a world


They don't call it a crime of passion

But it kills you just the same

It's murder when a true love dies

Right before your very eyes


And as soon as one is over

Another one will start

Every second someone breaks

Every second someone breaks a heart


If you've got someone who loves you

Be careful all the time

Do you know where your love is tonight

Cause there's always someone trying

To find the perfect crime

And you never know just when

They'll strike


So you better watch your woman

And you better watch your man

Cause no one's safe when love's at stake

Anybody's heart can break


And the next time that it happens

You're not the losing part

Every second someone breaks a heart

Every second someone breaks a heart

Every second someone breaks a heart

// Tell Me What's So Good About Goodbye //

I thought love was meant to last forever

Isn't that how love's supposed to be

Now it seems the good times are all over

It's so funny I guess the joke's on me


Every day I sit alone and wonder

Why I fell in love so easily

And then woke up to find that all he left behind

Are tattered dreams and broken pieces in my memory


So tell me what's so good about goodbye

What's so good about watching good love die

He's the kind you can't forget

So I won't even try

Tell me what's so good

I gave him all I could

Tell me what's so good about goodbye


I don't think I'll ever love another

I didn't know that goodbye could hurt so bad

I know I'll always find he's somewhere in my mind

Still believe the worst of him's the best I'll ever have


So tell me what's so good about goodbye

What's so good about watching good love die

He's the kind you can't forget

So I won't even try

Tell me what's so good

I gave him all I could

Tell me what's so good about goodbye

// He Broke Your Memory Last Night //

Like a rare piece of crystal

Like a fine china cup

I kept your memory all safely locked up

Afraid I could never love somebody new

I was trying to save what I had left of you


Then he broke your memory last night

I felt it shatter inside

I guess he held me a little too right

He broke your memory last night


The moment he touched me with his gentle hands

Your memory crumbled like a house built on sand

He swept all the pieces of your love away

And then gave me his love to put in it's place


Cause he broke your memory last night

I felt it shatter inside

I guess he held me a little too right

He broke your memory last night

He broke your memory last night

// If Only //

If only I'd have thought to send you roses

For no reason just to send you roses

And if only I thought to say more often I love you

But I just assumed you knew


And if only I'd have tried a little harder

If only we'd have talked a little more

If only I'd have held you closer

Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight

If only you, if only I

The saddest words are not goodbye

They're if only


If only we hadn't just pretended there was nothing wrong

It might not have ended

If only we'd have given more attention

To the small things

We might have it all today


And if only I'd have tried a little harder

If only we'd have talked a little more

If only I'd have held you closer

Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight

If only you, if only I

The saddest words are not goodbye

They're if only


Instead of silence

There'd been angry words

If we had only listened

We just might have held our hearts


And if only I'd have tried a little harder

If only we'd have talked a little more

If only I'd have held you closer

Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight

If only you, if only I

The saddest words are not goodbye

They're if only

// Congratulations //

Congratulations

You made a fool out of me

I hope you're happy

So now just let me be


I might be slow to lovers

But I catch on eventually

Congratulations

You made a fool out of me


Anticipation

You kept me waiting in line

Your situation did not allow you time

So I'd sit home alone

Pretending someday you'd be mine

Congratulations

You made a fool of me this time


Then he played it smart

You stole my heart

And tore my world apart

Guess you always knew

I'd be the perfect fool

Congratulations baby

You win, I lose


Imagination

The way I dreamed it could be

Ooo, the sweetest sensation

Of how you made love to me

But now the vision's gone

It's time to face reality

Congratulations

You made a fool out of me

Congratulations

You made a fool out of me

// Silver Eagle //

Luck can always change a state of your direction

Leave you looking for another place to run

There's no carrying the weight of your convictions

You just live with what you've done


Silver Eagle

100,000 miles beneath your wings

Flying down that broken line

No one's gonna know the way I feel


One more lost and lonely stranger by the highway

Tell me that I'll never see his face again

You're the only one who's ever going my way

Don't you know the state I'm in


Silver Eagle

100,000 miles beneath your wings

Flying down that broken line

No one's gonna know the way I feel


Silver Eagle

100,000 miles beneath your wings

Flying down that broken line

No one's gonna know the way I feel
