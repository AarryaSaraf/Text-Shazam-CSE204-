// Can't Stop Now //

I can't say I didn't know what I was doing

I can't pretend things just got out of hand

I should of kept my distance

While I was still strong

But I got caught up in the feeling

Carrying along

But it's too late baby

I can't stop now


Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open

But I was blind when you told me you'd be mine

Just as soon as you were free

I should have slowed down

Before push came to shove

But I was already falling

Now too deep in love

And it's too late baby

I can't stop now


Can't stop now

Crazy heart running out of control

Can't stop now

I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road

I might be heading for a breakdown

But I can't stop now


Well I'm sitting here wondering

How I ever let myself fall

I keep hearing promises

But nothing seems to change it all

The love we made

Has got a life of it's own

It'll keep on going long after you're gone

Now it's too late baby

Can't stop now


Can't stop now

Crazy heart running out of control

Can't stop now

I'll be falling apart somewhere down the road

I might be heading for a breakdown

But I can't stop now


I might be heading for a breakdown

But I can't stop now

I might be heading for a breakdown

But I can't stop now

// You Can Take The Wings Off Me //

Now I've never been in with the fast crowd

I've never been closer than just a little over the line

I know those nights I'd find great temptations

I go home to bed alone

Pull the covers up over my mind


I let it go by and said I'd save my feelings

But until I met you

I hardly used them at all

I should say no

Oh whoah I don't want to

Honey you will be the first one

To watch this angel fall


So you can take the wings off me

Lay them down so carefully

Hold me close tonight you'll see

I am yours and you can take the wings off me


Oh you can take the wings off me

Oh lay them down so carefully

Oh I should say no

Oh whoah I don't want to

I am yours and you can take the wings off me

// Whoever's In New England //

You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there

You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late and you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

// I'll Believe It When I Feel It //

Now when you left everybody told me

That I'd find another to take the place of you

And they all said someone else would hold me

And I'd have a lover to love like I loved you


I'll believe it when I feel it

When somebody makes me feel the way you did

They say he's out there

They tell me someday I'll forget

I'll believe it when I feel it

But I haven't felt it yet


I've heard in time

Time is going to heal me

It's been forever

And I still need you now

Maybe I will someday find that feeling

We had together

Oh but I've got my doubts


I'll believe it when I feel it

When somebody makes me feel the way you did

They say he's out there

They tell me someday I'll forget

I'll believe it when I feel it

But I haven't felt it yet


I'll believe it when I felt

But I haven't felt it yet

// I've Seen Better Days //

The sun is shining down

There's not one cloud around

Morning hits me

Where I lay


Everything was green

A perfect day it seems

Yeah he's got everything his way

Oh but I've seen better days

I've seen better days


When the rain was pouring down

And he had his loving arms wrapped around me

I've seen better days


The neighbors come and go

They smile and wave hello

And all the kids are out to play


Lollipops and good times

They look so much like mine

But he has taken mine away

Oh and I've seen better days

Lord I've seen better days


When the rain was pouring down

And he had his loving arms wrapped around me

I've seen better days


Oh Lord I miss 'em

I've seen better days

// Little Rock //

Well I'm married to the good life

I said I'd be a good wife

When I put on this ring

I drive a new Mercedes

I play tennis with the ladies

I buy all the finer things

But all that don't mean nothing

When you can't get a good night's loving


Oh little rock

Think I'm gonna have to slip you off

Take a chance tonight and untie the knot

There's more to life than what I've got

Oh little rock

You know this heart of mine just can't be bought

I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot

When I slip off this little rock


Well I wonder if he'll miss me

He doesn't even kiss me

When he comes home at night

He never calls me honey

But he sure loves his money

And I'm the one who pays the price

But when he finds this ring he'll see

He keeps everything but me


Oh little rock

Think I'm gonna have to slip you off

Take a chance tonight and untie the knot

There's more to life than what I've got

Oh little rock

You know this heart of mine just can't be bought

I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot

When I slip off this little rock


Oh little rock

Think I'm gonna have to slip you off

Take a chance tonight and untie the knot

There's more to life than what I've got

Oh little rock

You know this heart of mine just can't be bought

I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot

When I slip off this little rock

// If You Only Knew //

So here you are again

Standing at my door

You know I'd understand

Well that's what friends are for


What's he done this time

What did he say

To make you so darn mad

That you're running away

Now you say you want to be like me

Independent and free


But if you only knew

What a single girl goes through

The long working days and the lonley nights

The empty I love yous

Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone

You'd put your anger down

Turn around and go back home


My life looks good to you

I'm always in control

No one to answer to

But no one there to hold

You see in my eyes you are the lucky one

With loving arms that you can lean upon

I'd give anything I could to say

What you're throwing away


Cause if you only knew

What a single girl goes through

The long working days and the lonley nights

The empty I love yous

Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone

You'd put your anger down

Turn around and go back home


I know it's hard to face that love ain't perfect everyday

But I know a hundred girls who would gladly take your place


So if you only knew

What a single girl goes through

The long working days and the lonley nights

The empty I love yous

Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone

You'd put your anger down

Turn around and go back home


You'd put your anger down

Turn around and go back home

If you only knew

// One Thin Dime //

Your mind's made up

You're gonna leave

Nothing I can say will stop you so it seems

But before you up and go

There's just something you should know

When you find that I'm the one you still need


One thin dime

Is all it takes

When you need someone who cares

These arms of mine

Are always open

One thin dime is all you need

And I'll be there


Oh you're chasing rainbows and I understand

When you're through I'll take you back again

I'll be waiting patiently

For when you come back to me

Ain't nobody else can love you like I can


One thin dime

Is all it takes

When you need someone who cares

These arms of mine

Are always open

One thin dime is all you need

And I'll be there


You know the number

I'm always home

So honey just pick up and dial that telephone

When this world treats you unkind

Get your momma on the line

There ain't no need for you to ever be alone


One thin dime

Is all it takes

When you need someone who cares

These arms of mine

Are always open

One thin dime is all you need

And I'll be there


These arms of mine

Oh they're always open

One thin dime is all you need

And I'll be there

// Don't Touch Me There //

These hands

You can hold them all night if you want to

And these lips

Won't mind your kisses

No they don't care

You can lay your head on my shoulder

Maybe even get a little bolder

But when it comes to my heart

Oh don't touch me there


Oh these arms

You can wrap around me gently

And your fingers

You can run them through my hair

But there's one place that's off bounds

From the last time love came 'round

When it comes to my heart

Don't touch me there


Last time I gave my heart so sweetly it broke

He broke it so completely

And even now it's more then I can bear

Now someday I know I'll try again

Someday but until then

When it comes to my heart

Don't touch me there


Oh these hands you can hold them all night if you want to

And these lips won't mind your kisses

No they don't care

You can lay your head on my shoulder

Or maybe even get a little bolder

But when it comes to my heart

Don't touch me there


Oh when it comes to my heart

Don't touch me there

// To Make That Same Mistake Again //

Of all the broken hearts I've had

This one hurts the worst

His love flowed like a river

Now I'm dying of thirst

If loving him too much is why

I lost him in the end

Then I hope I can live long enough

To make that same mistake again


Well they say that love can be so strong that it's the choking kind

I never thought I'd see the day when love would be a crime

Mistakes can cost a lot and it

Sometimes we lose to win

Oh I hope I can live long enough

To make that same mistake again


Oh I may go crazy missing him

Knowing that it's my fault

But how could I have loved him less

Oh I tremble at the thought

And it's amazing how I'm holding on

With the shape I'm in

Oh I hope that I can live long enough

To make that same mistake again
