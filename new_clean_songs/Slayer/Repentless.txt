Album: Repentless

// Repentless //

Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride

My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can't take society any fuckin' more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it everyday
So take your shot, bottom's up, this is no lie
I'll be beating this guitar 'til the day I die

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride

I hate the life, hate the fame, hate fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
We're all killing ourselves a little more everyday

Live fast
On high
Repentless
Let it ride

// Take Control //

Voice is a weapon, bombs are away
Mind's a trigger, fire away
World's in a crossfire, of panic and fear
The war is upon us, I say it starts here

We will take control
Of this abortion called society
I despise the mediocrity
Inject the system with something new
A social terror to lead the few

Why call it the land of the free?
Political banter - If you ask me
Diffusing a problem, the question is how
With imminent conflict, the answer starts now

I can say
We're not the answer to the world's decay
Here to say
We're just the ones who won't go away

We will take control
Of this disaster called society
I despise the mediocrity
So now I'm going to introduce
A social terror that's on the loose

I am the propaganda war machine
The face of fury and obscenity
So when society has gone astray
I'll be the one to pave the way
They'll never fuck with my reality
'Cause this right here to me is unity
When all is done we'll have always shown
A domination that was never known

We will take control
Of this abortion called society
I despise the mediocrity
We are the torch that lights the fuse
A social terror with nothing to lose

// Vices //

Stop and think of society's impotence
And the reason behind its incompetence
Faith in God is the vice, bring on the tyranny
Won't be long 'til you find the real irony

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

Politician that claims to be the innocent
Sells you peace then defies you with his insolence
Greed and power his vices give him what he seeks
Manipulate and divide forever lead the weak

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

You've been powerless to your vices
Self-control defies you
When nothing else quite suffices
Your demons will destroy you

Holy man portrays the face of purity
Hiding behind as shroud of vanity
Pure lust is his vice a sickness to defile
God becomes a device to hide the pedophile

Life drags on and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high

So fuckin' high
LET'S GET HIGH!

// Cast The First Stone //

When war cries echo let it all begin
Never known any other way to fight, just win
Blood of the enemy, when penance is due
You know that sacrifice starts with you

Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood you will pay

I live for battle the intensity knows no peer
Your defiance will prove severe
Choking on blood, beaten in pain
Realizing the fight is all in vain

Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood you will pay

When the war cries echo sacrifice is you

You can feel that it's with me everywhere I walk
Like a devastating fire every time I talk
Manifested confidence you can't stop
A block of granite on my shoulder you can't knock off

Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood you will pay

On fields of blood, you will pay

// When The Stillness Comes //

Blood was like paste on the walls
Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinguished in a rage
So nauseous I don't realize
Incessantly feeding the flies
In a moment of visceral haze
The last thing you see are my crazed eyes
The last thing you see are my eyes

Fear lies beneath your facade
In panic you scream for your God
No way I'll ever abstain
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Patiently I unleash my violence
Ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
In darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood
Blood from above

This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
There's no God pulling at my strings
I'm above all sorrow faith can bring
Disengaged, I see your face
An adrenaline rush I can't replace
Hands around your neck, your senses numb
Staring into your eyes when the stillness comes!

// Chasing Death //

You can never truly see
Inside the ones you know
Until you've found them near
The edge of self-control

All I hear are lies
You're lying to yourself
And everything is out of control

You're just a fuckin' slave of discontent
I'm sick of watching you dig this hole

Time waits - for no one
Won't stop - It can't be outrun
You know - That pain in your head
Won't stop 'til the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop chasing death

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance
Of anything that you've got to say
Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out

I know I should have seen it all coming
But I had to find it out on my own
A whore to incompetence you hide behind
The shadow that once was your thrown
Control is a discipline even when
Frustration just stands in your way
The throes of insanity feel just like
A war inside you everyday

I know I should have seen it all coming
But I had to find it out on my own
A whore to incompetence you hide behind
The shadow that once was your thrown
Control is a discipline even when
Frustration just stands in your way
The throes of insanity feel just like
A war inside you everyday

Time waits - for no one
Won't stop - It can't be outrun
There's just - no way of knowing
How long - paranoia's growing
Please - Just take away this feeling
You know - That pain in your head
Won't stop until the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop until you're dead

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance
Of anything that you've got to say
Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out

// Implode //

So is it just me
Can everyone see
The world drowning in its own blood
Humanity's decline
Dismantled over time
A fossil drying in the mud
Deception and the greed
That germinates the seed
Of dissent growing all around
Is this the beginning or the end
In darkness we descend
And I can't wait to see it all go down

Standing room only all the world will attend
Front row center to the ultimate end
Mankind constantly parading its flaws
Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
Like a firestorm raging out of control
Ignorance of all has taken its toll
It seems that blame is your personal hell
Dish it out to anyone but never yourself

IMPLODE
No resurrection of divine
IMPLODE
Extermination of the swine

Sick of this shit called policy
Life support for a dead economy
Brain dead leaders of the world conspire
Acting with malice only fuels the fire
No wonder people of religion obsess
All it wants a man to do is confess
Arrogance will never let the fools concede
You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

IMPLODE
Cleansation of mankind
IMPLODE
Extermination of the Swine

So many still ask why
I've said a million times
There's nothing godly looking over us
It's just the choice you make
I'll still inject the hate
That brings finality to the fuss
Society will bleed
So watch the violence breed
And deconstruct the protocol
And if I'm proven wrong
I think you know the song
I'm pretty sure that God still hates us all

Standing room only all the world will attend
Front row center to the ultimate end
Mankind constantly parading its flaws
Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
No wonder people of religion obsess
All it wants a man to do is confess
Arrogance will never let the fools concede
You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

IMPLODE
Cleansation of mankind
IMPLODE
Extermination of the swine

No resurrection of divine
Extermination of the swine
It's the cleansation of mankind
No resurrection of divine
Extermination of mankind

// Piano Wire //

The traitor stands within the wolves' lair
Body count now imminent
The tension will rise, the air is on fire
This nightmare will not go on
Prophecy has touched my hand
The outcome starts here and now
Raise the flag as it burns
This nation's blood will not be lost

Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack - continue - never
Never surrender

Your body will hangs piano wire plays
The music will relieve you
So delicate and lifeless now
Is innocence victorious?
Do you think I won't touch your grave?
Devotion to all insane
If war is lost you will die before I
Without dignity for all to see

Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender

We shall be victorious
Attack - continue - never
Never surrender

The terror won't end without you my friend
This philosophy dreams of murder
Liquidated down painless face
Death has come no one to mourn
Who will scream when all are gone?
Not for love, for the enemy
Fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
Divine providence the world's end

Drink the war
Piano wire plays
Your body hangs
Piano wire plays

Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack
Never surrender

// Atrocity Vendor //

You're staring at the atrocity vendor
A fucking equal opportunity offender
I've got the plan that's gonna change this world
Stand back and watch the seeds of hate unfold

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you
Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed
I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulse in my veins, death forever reigns

This is more than just my endless rapture
I'll fucking guarantee of your impending disaster
A socio-path with my thawable control
Aggregate of terror watch the seeds of death unfold

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you
Reeking of his breath, It's a new fucking nightmare
I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real,I can show you how it feels
Violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns

You're staring at the atrocity vendor
A mother fucking equal opportunity offender
I'll introduce you to my own morbid charm
And fist fuck you with your own severed arms

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, torture every part of you
Criss-cross, terrorize, personal genocide
I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels

Violence pulses in my veins, death forever.....death forever reigns.

// You Against You //

I had you back, but it's no use
False accusations are on the loose
You know what? It makes no sense that you tied your own noose
You never felt the sores decay
Your perfect world is ending today
So what? I wouldn't have it any other way

Is this your paradise? You think you thought this through?
'Cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you
Don't care what you do or say, your suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you

You against you
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you

So how's your paradise? Hindsight just laughs at you
With conflict comes a price, that price weighs heaviest on you
I guess I should say thanks, dissension in the ranks
You panic lit the fuel, now it's you against you
You against you

Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you

The seeds are what you've sown
Never should have lit that fuse
Enjoy your paradise
This hell is just for you

You against you
Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you

// Pride In Prejudice //

You made your choice
I'll take my stand
Your life story in my blood stained hands

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence

Abuse of power, civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocent unites

I'm right you're wrong
In number I'm strong
Violence is proof enough that I am

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence
Marshall Law as militant state
Barrel of a gun seals your fate
Fire burns with media hype
Speak the truth through your own lies

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Hate and violence
One gunshot sets the precedence
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me your bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot killed the innocent

Some love to hate
Right in your face
Violence will facilitate

Fuel the fire with racial slurs
And see who kills the other first
