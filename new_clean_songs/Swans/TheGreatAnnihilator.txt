// I Am The Sun //

And I am the sun
I rise above the world
And when the light goes out
I kill another child
And I am insane
I crawl into your mouth
I grow like a flower
I grow a suicide
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
And I am the light (I love everyone)
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

And I am the dog
I cut out my eyes
Yeah I will nullify
My true love creation
And I am the sun
I love everyone
I live inside your chest
I grow like a cancer
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

I love everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone
(I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone)

// She Lives! //

Now I just want to thank you
For going insane
Every second you suffer
Is a loss that I gain
Every breath is a drain down
Down into a hole
And your mind is a shrinking thing
It was crushed by your skull
Now you feel time unfolding
Deep in your chest
And your body's expanding
Now there's none of you left
So I just want to thank you
For losing your mind
Yeah you burned just like Joan of Arc
Purified by the flames
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive

And I just want to thank you
For the light that you spread
And magnesium and sulphur
And the fear in your head
And I just want to tell you
You're nothing so new
Every time that you touch it
It'll turn against you
Now your future's a cold thing
Down in the damp ground
And your memory's a lead room
Containing this sound
So I just want to thank you
For killing your mind
All the life that you bleed out
Well I steal it for mine
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive, you're alive
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive

// Celebrity Lifestyle //

The secret sign of a charmed existence
Is the shiny liquid on her lips
And the ecstasy that comes with her image grows
From the power that the money gives
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
She's just floating in space
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
All her children want a suck and a taste of
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle
Yeah, her celebrity life
And she's just a drug addiction
And a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind

The secret wisdom of 120 days
Is hidden deep in between her legs 
And sexual transcendence is reserved for the wealthy 
But is only one joy that money can make, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she's got a glowing white face, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she ties her naked children up with wires and lace 
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle is the
Product of a celebrity mind, yeah
Oh, her celebrity mouth is the
Perfect image of the end of time

Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle

There's a place in space
Where violence and love
Collide inside 
And solid is wide
And heat is cold
And birth is death
And creation and time
Are made from destruction
From fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction

Now ride

// Blood Promise //

When silence falls
And light remains
And time is born
Beneath the Sun
I'll hide your name
Inside a word
And paint your eyes
With false perception
And I feel your mind
In everything
And every breath
Destroys a sound
And I never will follow
A false sensation
And I'll always believe
Your blood promise

Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na

And every breath
I stole from you
And I never will see
Your broken body
And you never have spoken
An unclear word
And I'll never betray
Your blood promise

Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na

// Mind / Body / Light / Sound //

Throw your mind away 
Fall into the sea 
There's nothing solid here 
Dissolve your body today 
There's a sun in the sky
We're in the atmosphere 
Throw yourself in the sea
There's nothing solid down here

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound

This ordinary night 
This ordinary day 
They're twisted out of shape 
Then they disintegrate 
Cool water runs through the ground 
The ocean blends with the air 
Throw yourself in the fire 
There's nothing solid down here 

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, soundless light

The world was over today
The time is already gone
Throw your mind in the sea
Eternity doesn't last very long
There's some people on Earth
They live in separate minds
Dissolve your body today
There is no more outside

(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, soundless light
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
(Mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound, mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound

// My Buried Child //

My frozen, empty, violent mind caressed the hidden hair that shines
With liquid lust I left behind your body stained with ruined eyes 
I cut the skin, concealed the crimes, with liquid hate I left inside 
And loneliness is buried here in rotting holes beneath your fear 
Your agony, your twisted struggle, two bodies sink in meat-blood strangled 
The smell of death, your tortured gash, enfold me in your mother's arms

Now hold me in your mother's arms
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)

// Alcohol The Seed //

I need alcohol
To open my blood
I need alcohol
To empty my head
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol

I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol
I need alcohol

// Killing For Company //

I couldn't stop myself
I knew I'd do it again
But I could heal myself
If I could feel your skin
And if I comprehend this moment
I know we'll live again
And if I heal your wound
We will make love again
And now we're slipping through
This millennium
We should feel sorry for the people
And can I kiss your skin?
And there's hunger in the desert
And missiles in the sky
And every soul is interwoven
Before the wrong or right

I know we'll live again
Though it's just a feeling
I know we'll never end
I'll keep you company

I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company

// Mother's Milk //

And I'll sleep in the sea 
And I'll wait there beneath the mud 
And forgotten dreams and disease 
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul 
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull 
And where is the wound that shines the blue light 
And who is the dead man my body made love to last night

And I'll sleep in the sea 
And I'll wait there beneath the mud 
And forgotten dreams and disease 
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul 
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull

// Where Does A Body End? //

The future's leaking through a shut lead door 
In the ruins of a city under the forest floor. 
Your naked body's buried in a vacant field 
What does your body feel now

The air is black and has no oxygen 
The bodies in the river float beneath the sun 
Transparent skin it shines a light from deep within 
Where does your body begin

The stars are hidden by a mirrored sky 
And darkness disappears behind reflected light 
Perception is a distance in a closed-in space 
How will your body escape

The crowd is feeling you inside your head. 
Your imagination's canceled by its opposite 
And every possibility's been proved untrue 
Now is your body you

// Telepathy //

And we steal our experience from an object that suffers 
But the brightest pain leaves a shadow on no one 
I saw you through the window masturbating to the violence 
And the blood and the bodies floated through the blue sun. 
And the green earth turns to flesh in your hand 
And the ether was born in the lungs of an ancient man 
We hallucinated at night. 
Our mind's in the light 
But I can't feel the body of the image which is now penetrating my sight 
But you're beautiful. 
And you're real 
Are you beautiful? 
Are you real?

And my body begins where your memory ends 
You were melted from stone. 
I was touched by your hands 
I can feel it when pleasure moves up your spine 
I can tell we're alive because your blood just blended with mine
And the angels of heaven never sacrificed a sensation as pure as the cut of this knife 
And the wisdom contained in the telepathy of fear 
Solidified our suffering into the droning sound I still hear 
But you're beautiful. 
And you're real 
Are you beautiful? 
Are you real?

// The Great Annihilator //

One second burns for a billion years 
And time is relative 
And light is physical 
We feel your body 
We feel your feelings 
We see the eye of god shine through the citadel 
And space is empty behind the universe 
The past and future were simultaneous. 
Inside your body we feel your emptiness 
The light we breathe in is your unconsciousness 
And your body disappears, 
Burning backwards through the years 
And in your hands time was made 
And through breathing 
You'll erase it 
But we can see forever. 
Before love and hate 
And we will fall right through the wall of the place where we were made 
Right into the open mouth of the great annihilator
