Album: Cop

// Why Hide //

My heart pumps
My legs move
I sit down
I rot
I hide my stink
I follow directions
I know how to work
I keep my mouth shut
I know my place
I hide my stink
I need you more than I hate myself
You hurt me then you hurt yourself
Why hide the lie

// Clay Man //

Get into this car
Get into this car
Bow your head down
Your flesh is soft
Your flesh is clay
Flesh is easy to shape
Flesh is easy to shape
Get into your cell
Get into your bed
Your flesh is soft
Your flesh is clay
Flesh is easy to shape
Flesh is easy to shape
Now you're a clay man

// Your Property //

I give you money
You're superior
I don't exist
You control me.
You're corrupt
You deform me
You own me
You own me
I worship your authority
I worship your authority
You're deformed
You're corrupt
You own me
You own me

// Butcher //

You're too close
I don't recognize your smell
You're in the wrong skin
I don't recognize your smell
Your mouth smells strange
Some people want to kill you
Some people want to fuck you
When you say the wrong word
You could be screwing yourself
When you act the wrong way
When you do the wrong thing
You could be screwing yourself
Don't be a whore
You could be screwing yourself
