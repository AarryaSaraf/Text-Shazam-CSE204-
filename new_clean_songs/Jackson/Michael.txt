// Hollywood Tonight //

[Michael Jackson:]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown to pursue her movie star dreams
And she's giving hot tricks to men just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe

[Taryll Jackson (Michael Jackson):]
She gave up her life to follow her dreams (Again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood

[Michael Jackson:]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again
That chance again, babe
You know it, baby

[Michael Jackson {Taryll Jackson}:]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
{She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood}
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
{She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood}
You know it, baby
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)
{She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood}
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)

[Taryll Jackson:]
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood

// Keep Your Head Up //

She's lookin' for a job and to find a place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promisin'
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside every time her baby cries, no

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly

We're killin' up the life in the birds and the trees
And we're suckin' up the air in the earth from under me (It's never too late)
I can't even breathe (Just lean)
I can't even see (On me)
Keep your head up, don't give up today
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today

All you need is love
Tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, want it to
Keep your head up

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
Fly away, fly away, fly away (Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my

Everybody say that time is borrowed
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance
Fight your circumstance
Rise and do it again

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (ho-oh-oh)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly

Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today
Keep your head up
The ol' sun's gonna rise on us today, today
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up (I need your love, I need you now)
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (I need your light from here today)

// Monster //

[Michael Jackson:]
You can look at them comin' out the walls
You can look at them climbin' out the bushes
You can find them when the letter's 'bout to fall
He be waitin' with his camera right on focus

Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air there's a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumpin' like you should
(Too bad)
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you like it?
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Monster, yeah, he's a monster, he's an animal, ho-oh-oh

He's coming at you
Coming at you rather too fast
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
And you're runnin'
And you're runnin' just to 'scape it
But they're gunnin' for the money
So they fake it

Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air, there's a monster
When you see them in the street
That's a monster, monster, monster

(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumping like it should
It's got you bouncing off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like what you see
Monster, he's like an animal, (he's a monster) just like an animal (he's an animal)
And he's moving in the air
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Everybody wanna be a video star

Why are they never satisfied with'n all you give?
You give them your all, they're watching you fall
And they eat your soul (like a vegetable)

[50 Cent:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me in a bad mood, flipping, you'll take a whippin'
Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addiction
Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'
Shiver a second, now, now, now, what is it?
Funerals, cemeteries, don't worry, it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kiddin'?
It's home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
All hail, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there's nothing iller, it's killer
Their vision, they miss 'em, won't impact, this is that
It's the bomb, ring the alarm, MJ number one
It goes on and on, it goes on and on
We get to creeping and crawling in the early morn'
Dream on dreamer, there's nowhere to run
You can try but you're done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come

[Michael Jackson:]
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood has got you jumpin' like you should
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just making me clearer
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you?

Monster, say you wanna be a star
He's a monster, say you wanna go far
He's an animal, why do you keep stalking me?
Monster (what you do to me?)
He's a monster, why'd you take it? Why'd you fake it?
He's an animal, yeah, why d'you torture me?
Monster, why you stalkin' me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal
Why did you do it? Why did you? Why you stalkin' me?
Monster, why d'you torture me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal, why d'you? Why d'you? Ho-oh-oh!

He's dragging you down like a monster
He's keeping you down like a monster
He's dragging you down like a monster
He's keeping you down like a monster

// Best Of Joy //

I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you, I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you", we are forever

I am the one who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be (The only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady, let come what may we do get by

I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you

We are forever (I am forever, alright)
We are forever (I am forever, uh-huh)
We are forever (ah, what you do? What ya' live for?)
We are forever (What you do? What ya' live for? Our love is strong)
We are forever (What you do? What ya' live for? Uh-huh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
I am forever, I am forever (Ah, uh-huh, alright)
We are forever (Hoo-hoo), we are forever (Hee)
I am forever, I am forever

// Behind The Mask //

All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
You know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (Cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask

I walk around I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I don't know

Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)

// Much Too Soon //

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
