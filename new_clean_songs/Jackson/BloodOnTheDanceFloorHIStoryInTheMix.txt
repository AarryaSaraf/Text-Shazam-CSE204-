// Blood On The Dance Floor //

She got your number, ah
She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got your baby, ah
It happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah
Erase the past (Ah)

Every night stance is like taking a chance (Ah)
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it's right (Hoo-hoo)

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend (Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (Ah)
Susie says it's right

It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Hoo!

// Morphine //

He got flat, baby
Kick in the back, baby
A heart attack, baby
I need your body
A hot kiss, honey
He's just a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
So unrelyin'
I'm such a swine, baby
All down the line, daddy
I hate your kind, baby
So unreliable
A hot buzz, baby

Another drug, baby
You so desirable

Trust in me
Trust in me
Put all your trust in me

Kicked in the face, baby
You hate your race, baby
You're just a liar
Your every lick, baby
Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You soul survivor
She never cut from me
She never cut, baby
I had to work, baby
You just a rival
Always so please, daddy
Right up and leave, daddy
You're throwin' shame, daddy
So undesirable

Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Go on, babe

Relax
This won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry
I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away
Demerol
Demerol
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol
Demerol
Demerol
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol
He's tried
Hard to convince her
To be over what he had
Today he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry
I won't resent you
Yesterday you had his trust
Today he's taking twice as much
Demerol

Is truth a game, daddy
To win the fame, baby
It's all the same, baby
You're so reliable

// Ghosts //

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

I don't understand it
Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

Don't understand it!
(Gotta ghost gotta break in the walls)
Yeah yeah!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
You're just a dog gone!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Aaow!

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to scare my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow!

Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

// Is It Scary? //

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?

And if you wanna to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light

But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?
Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
'Cause the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh, boy
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you? Oh, boy
So tell me am I scary for you baby? (Hoo!)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is scary for you baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Am I scary for you? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't wanna talk about it) (Hoo! Hoo!)
(I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it) (Hoo!)

Is this scary for you, baby? (Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby
