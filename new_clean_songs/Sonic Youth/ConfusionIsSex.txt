// (She's In A) Bad Mood //

[Thurston]

She's in a bad mood

But I won't fall for it

I believe all her lies

But I can't fall for it


She's in a bad mood

But I won't fall for it

I believe all her lies

But I can't fall for it

// Freezer Burn / I Wanna Be Your Dog //

[Kim]

So messed up, I want you here

In my room, I want you here

Now we're gonna be face-to-face

And we lay right down in my favorite place


Now I wanna be yr dog

Now I wanna be yr dog

Now I wanna be yr dog


Well, Come on


Now I'm ready to close my eyes

But now I'm ready to close my mind

And now I'm ready to feel your hand

And lose my heart on the burning sand


Now I wanna be yr dog

Now I wanna be yr dog

Now I wanna be yr dog


Well, Come on

// Inhuman //

[Thurston]

Oi

Aha [repeat ten times]


My body is a pasttime

My mind is a simple joy

I learned my lesson

The hardest way

But you don't know me

But you don't know me

A complete inhuman

My body is a past time

My mind is a simplejoy

I learned my lesson

The hardest way

But you don't know me

But you don't know me

// The World Looks Red //

[Thurston]

Push it away

The world looks red

People with fish eyes

The ground sucks

Walk on my fingertips

Displacing the fog

The weight of my body

Is too mush to bear

The memory drained

The life from the dull

An ocean of insects

Worked like a sheet

The immovable fact

Buried my mind

In a horse-hair coat

In a pile

On the floor


Push it away

The world looks red

People with fish eyes

The ground sucks

Walk on my fingertips

Displacing the fog

The weight of my body

Is too much to bear

The memory drained

The life from the doll

The ocean of insects

Moved like a sheet

The immovable fact

Buried my mind

In a horsehair coat

In a pile

On the floor

// Confusion Is Next //

[Thurston]

I maintain that

Chaos is the future

And beyond it is freedom

Confusion is next and next after that is the truth

You gotta cultivate what you need to need

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth


Stick your fingers

In your mouth

Squeeze your tongue

And wrench it out

From its ugly fucking cancer

Its ugly fucking cancer

Root

You gotta cultivate what you need to need

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth


Chaos is the future

And beyond it is freedom

Confusion is next and next after that is the truth

You gotta cultivate what you need to need

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth


Stick your fingers

In your mouth

Squeeze your tongue

And wrench it out

From its ugly fucking cancer

Its ugly fucking cancer

Root

You gotta cultivate what you need to need

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth

Sonic tooth


Tell nothing but the truth

// Making The Nature Scene //

[Kim]

Going back to these origins

The city is a natural scape

Order in the details

Confusion uproar in the whole

In nature reality is selection

The tool of critical intervention

Fragmentation is the rule

Unity is not taught in school

You are an unnatural growth

On a funny sunny street

The city has forgotten you

It's symbols of the past

The meaning of its state

Its order of decay

Stand now in a column

And make the nature scene


Standing now in columns

Making the nature scene

Making the nature scene

Waiting to make their pay

There is no resistance to

The signs along the way

Standing all in columns

Waiting to make their pay

Making the nature scene

Waiting for the day

There is no resistance to

There is no resistance to

Salvation means to count on you

It just means to count on you

Make the nature scene


Making the nature scene

Making the nature scene

Making the nature scene


Going back to these origins

The city is a natural scape

Order in the details

The tool of critical intervention
