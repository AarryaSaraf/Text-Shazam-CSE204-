// Free City Rhymes //

In a free lane

Ghosts passing time

Heat rises

Lights thru the town

Blown soundscapes

Blue city eyes

Black lightning

New angel flies


Make a free line

To the northern sky

Holy rain falls

Ghosts burn to shine

Elevator

Reach for the lights

Intuition

Free city rhymes

// Renegade Princess //

Jet black hair

Tangled stare

Blood inside

Silent stare

Naked heart

Red light night

Tangled heart

Midnight hair

Poor mans bride

Moonlight fight

Renegade

Crystal heart


Make way for the midnight princess

Midnight princess fight tonight

Renegades fight for life

Naked stairs in the midnight rain

Gonna fight for yr blood tonight

Crystal hearts gonna break you down

Tangled hearts in a midnight fight

Renegade princess fight

Fight

// Nevermind (What Was It Anyway) //

Best + sexy what was it anyway

Jean-michel what was it anyway

Saw you there what was it anyway

Kneel right down what was it anyway

Guitar on the ground what was it anyway

Lost yr hand what was it anyway

Hipsters stand what was it anyway

Glitter tongue what was it anyway

Gave you a flower what was it anyway

Gave you the power what was it anyway

Saintly ghosts what was it anyway

Tingling down what was it anyway

Nevermind what was it anyway


Soot me over / feel me naked

Soot me over / feel me escape


Boys go to jupiter to get more stupider

Girls go to mars, become rock stars


Come on down down to the river

Come on down and jump right in

Come on down I dare you to win now

Come on down and down my friend

Come on down and jump in the river

Come on down and jump right in

// Small Flowers Crack Concrete //

Small flowers crack concrete

Narcotic squads sweep thru poet dens

Spilling coffe grabbing 15 yr old runaway girls

By frazzled ponytailed hair + tossing them

Into backseats of cop cars

The narcs beat the bearded oracles

Replacing tantric love with

Complete violence


Lights + mirrors dot the city

Inkstained hippies w/ boxed lunch + marijuana

Mystery plays of shit and nothingness

Blessed by colors from a black hat


Blue lights search thru weeds

Searching for the heart of d.a.levy

And the mind he left behind


What didjoo expect? another mystic wreck?

Thats whatchoo got crawling in yr panic net

Whatdidjoo bring me? not a goddamn thing yet

+ whatdidjoo leave me? another tombstone dream yeh

O salacious mansion, the boys held for ransom

Didja see where he's gone? the blasted summers dawn

Fucked up in cleveland fucked up in cleveland

Short flight to nothing heavens up to something heavens up to something

Levys up to something levys up to something


Death poems for the living gods of america

Plastic saxophones bleat, bleed for nothing, nada

Cops crashing thru doors infuriated by silver charms

Of suburban smoke

At war with patches of red dirt glitter

And bluejean fucking

+ protest

// Side2Side //

Meet me on the corner

Thursday

Wear your

Special

Underwear

Sway side 2 side

Automatic

Special

Underwear

// StreamXSonik Subway //

Flipped on my perceptive cogs

Checked in with the future gods

For melodies of bees and hogs

Start my day the perfect way


Burned a batch of mazzy funk

Poor girl noise and choke style punk

Clapped it on and off I slunk

To the streamXsonik subway


First I need my iris scanned

As I smell the breeze of electric tin

W/ purple lights I'm motioned in

Wink the gain to minus 10


Fell asleep and missed my stop

Got rousted by a low-beam cop

Got a ticket-patch for ilicit flop

Then froze me with his jesus gun


That don't mean I'm shot down yet

The glow below of the whisper jet

It all means so much to us

We dream below the rainbows rust


Clippen on my streetmatik clogs

Pushed thru the hyped-out fervent fogs

Found my way with sensoid jogs

New radio structure


State my name and locus frame

Paid the price for crashing fame

The apprentice sparks his initial flame

The printout says "further"


Antique minds with rivered hair

StreamXsonik subway fare

Stay in touch with electric dear

Our lightmap eyes together

// NYC Ghosts & Flowers //

When the phone rang, 3 in the morn, dead middle of night

There was nuthin on the line

I set back the silent receiver

tiny flames lit in my head

Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember lenny?

I can't remember his last name

He's turned to dust now, one of the chosen few

Left out in the rain, out of town again

Left out in the rain, ocean bound I guess


Between the matress and a column of hazy faces

I remember every word you said

Quite a clear picture ev'ry word you said

The door was open but the way was not lit

And there was no way out of my head


On a crimson hiway by a chrome bumper I last saw you:

Alive

inclined to thrive

evening fireflies lit sparks around yr head


But wait a minute let's back up a bit:

Some famous stars were busted by the thought police down on fashion avenue

Impersonating real men

not knowing who they really were

Now here at dark corners all is calm and quiet and good

The kids are up late dreaming quiet questions in a graceful mood:


Can you please pass me a jug of winter light?

Fold me in an ocean's whim?

In sweet corrosive fire light?

In the city made of tin?


Are you famous under the skin?

Familiar with the things you wanted?

Able now to take it all in?

Making peace w/ every hole in the story?


Did lightning keep you up all night?

Illuminate the soot and grit?

Can you tell how high the sky tonight?

Dig out from under in spite of it?


Can you cover up the one that floats?

Can you push back the hours?

I hear yr voice, I speak yr name

Among nyc ghosts and flowers

Will we meet? to run again?

Thru nyc ghosts and flowers

// Lightnin' //

Lightnin'

Lightnin' strike

Lightnin' strikes

Lightnin' strike me

Lightnin' strikes me

Lightnin' strike me down

Lightnin' strikes me down

Lightnin' strikes me down
