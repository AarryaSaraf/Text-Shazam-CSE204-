// Take This Life //

It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And curse my fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

[Pre Chorus:]
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see. Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

[Chorus:]
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The rain drops just beg to hit me
What now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me free and

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

// Leeches //

Leeches.
Like leeches
"In ignorance we trust"
If you say this way, I'll take that way
Fuel for the fire on which I thrive

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

Leeches, they preach to us
Words of wisdom from blocked minds

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

They make you believe your turn
The chance of a lifetime,
How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet that can't be heard
(And) praise the artist that steals

// Reflect The Storm //

Shot for shot
Many bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don't come much bigger than this
Dark star spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take the chance
Bring me the calm

...And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side,
Aching and emotional,
Expose the dark side,
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me,
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash and burn it
Try and find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

... And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side, aching and emotional
Expose the dark side, impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

// Dead End //

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among hypocrites
The melody of our time

[Chorus:]
So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth
Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster!

What decides when you've lost the war
When the first man falls?
Or when they erase it all?

We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed my life's tear

In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I should care less
'Cause I will die too

[Chorus]

What will it take for us to realize
The more we provoke
Winter will come twice

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

Scream you lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait for ever
Here's the next disaster! [2x]

// Scream //

We are ordinary people
We all live different lives
In the end we're pretty much the same
We're just living in different lies

We just live in different lies
We just live in different lies

They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We are ordinary people
In a world built on stress
When we build walls around us
We end up in a mess

We end up in a mess
We just end up in a mess

They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We just live in different lies
We just live in different lies

They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

// Come Clarity //

Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day... by two
Drawing pictures of innocent times
Can you add color... inside these lines?

[Chorus x2:]
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live
In a dream... one more day

Sure it would change my perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Just don't want to live
In a dream one more day [x2]

// Vacuum //

The yesterday we loved speak of tomorrow
The burden of man is that time never takes a pause
We live from Monday to Sunday but we forget what it means
Then a ghost comes to visit and we tell stories from tabloids

Call all your friends
Watch fake photos
From a made up vacation
Speaking in tongues about ancient artifacts

We steal from beggars and ask for understanding
We lie, rape, steal and murder to make tonights headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get the stronger they become

Listen in silence
Hear a voice
How far are we ready to take this?

Listen in silence
Hear a voice
Before it all crumbles

Lie, rape, steal and murder
Smile, applaud, love, hail

Gather in front of the TV
Exploding sympathy
The weatherman, our trust
Our punctual company

We steal from beggars and ask for understanding
We lie, rape, steal and murder to make tonights headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get the stronger they become

Listen in silence
Hear a voice
How far are we ready to take this?

Listen in silence
Hear a voice
Before it all crumbles

Lie, rape, steal and murder, smile, applaud, love, hail

Listen in a silence, hear a voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence, hear a voice
Before it all crumbles

// Pacing Deaths Trail //

Compassion.
Confession.
It's all a compromise.

Dedication.
Domination.
Please define the lines.

Irritation.
Innovation.
Paired up to succeed.

Totalization.
Termination.
Fake smiles and greed.

Surrender to nothing.
Or run, as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on to what I believe in,
But my heart is in a coma!

Aggression.
Attention.
A need to be seen.

Directed.
Disrespected.
Stand in a line to be thankful
OBSCENE

Surrender to nothing.
Or run, as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on to what I believe in,
But my heart is in a coma!

// Crawl Through Knives //

The black hole forever mine.
I need fear.
Push me out
Oh be brave
Show me signs
Should I feel shame for the questions that I have

If you could be
The things I need.
I'll crawl through knives
An inch per tear.

These knees, they bleed for you.
Let the colour persuade the hate
That you fear.

Feed the lie.
Force the reason.
Leave me in doubt.
Need some motivation

It's in my hands.
The sky is so bright.
It's burning.
It's for me to decide.
If flames will reach heaven tonight.
It's in my hands.

Nailed to the floor
Paralyzed
Emotions drifting
Touch the new

If you could be
The things I need.
I'll crawl through knives
An inch per tear.

These knees, they bleed for you.
Let the colour persuade the hate
That you fear.

// Versus Terminus //

When all is said and done
We'll know what's right, what's wrong
But does it matter then
When all is said and done

When all is dead and gone
We'll know who lost, who won
But does it matter then
When all is dead and gone

See everything go
End of all things
The life that we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the lights go out
We know what life's about
But does it matter then
When all the lights go out

When all that's left is lies
We'll see nothingness and realize.
But does it matter then
When all that's left is lies?

// Our Infinite Struggle //

In a disaster story
A central conflict of primal rage
Usual sort of desperation
Characters remain the same

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

Walk on broken glass
Is the pain safe at the end?
All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

(I cut you in)

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts as I cut you in

// Vanishing Light //

Vanishing light
The end of a compromise
In fury, in rage
A dream will diminish

Behind enemy lines
Learn to survive
Find a way to clone
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

You're on the easy route
Money up front?
There's no doubt

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

It's so sad
But pay no mind!

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

// Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone //

Find time and play with innocence
Like you ever would
I don't see you make any sense
I guess you deliver misery
Just like you should

1 o'clock and you paint the skies grey
It's not your fault We're the ones who betray
But how can you say it with such ease
You want to take a stand or just wanna please

Your bedtime story is scaring everyone
But you make me understand
The evil that man do
The evil that man do
