// Weightlifters //

Back when I had time to dream
I dreamed of ordinary faces
Frozen unexpressed emotions
Trapped inside the wax museum
And what my mind had been curating
Scandalized my sense of station
My face poured in, and I woke up
Feeling like shit when I saw my ordinary face
I should start lifting weights

Put your heart on the target
They expect you to scream
Music blasts through the market
It's the sound of machines
And quarters crushing the penny
One bout turned into many
My resistance is crushed
I'm just here about some tangerines
And maybe grapes without seeds

'Cause I believe that thoughts can change your body
It's all on me if thoughts can change your body
I believe that thoughts can change my body
You don't know me, your body can't change your mind

And maybe if I keep my mouth shut
God will answer all my prayers
Let my secret vision sprawl
Declasssified another ship
And then I put my arms around you
And say, "Thank God that I found you"
I kept my mouth shut
And hoped that this would happen to me

I see the patterns in things
I never knew this was a part of me
He who sings in the choir
I feel the tension, I'm afraid it will break
I should start lifting weights

'Cause I believe that thoughts can change your body
It's all on me if thoughts can change your body
I believe that thoughts can change my body
You don't know me, your body can't change your mind

// Can't Cool Me Down //

(Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down)

Schizophrenia dreaming
I got a real bad feeling
With a taste like lemon
Having trouble breathing
Getting high on nothing
Taking credit for nothing
Inside my head is an empty head
Introducing friends to friends

There is a hole in the ceiling
Everything but me and it has got no feeling
Smoke is pouring out the vents
I crawl like an animal to ya
(Crawl, crawl, an animal to ya)
It's a time of need and I need you to help me
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
Please
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
Animal to ya
(I crawl, I crawl, an animal to ya)
An animal to ya

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, can't cool me down

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down
(No, it can't-)

Vivid visions
It's been so long since I
Heard your voice and
Felt your feeling for me
Camille Raquin at the mortuary
I like Chopin, won't you sing me to sleep?
No, don't, Daniel
(No, don't, Daniel)
You think you see a light but
There is nothing in a flame but fire
(There is nothing)
Is it satisfaction?
(Is it satisfaction?)
Is it only practice for the real thing?
(Is it only practice for the real thing?)
Snap out of the drug trip screaming

Hey, we're not supposed to be here!
(We're not supposed to be here)
Hey, we're not supposed to be here!
(We're not supposed to be here)
Now my blood is dirty water
Drain it, bleed it, wash it down the drain
The devil in the other, somebody else's mistake
I am dripping with sweat, my hands
I can't hold anything in my hands
I've only made one mistake in my life
I've only made one mistake, I'm going

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, no, it can't cool me down
Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down

Cool water on my brow
Can't cool me down, it can't cool me down

Cool

(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)
(Cool me down, cool me down)

// Deadlines (Hostile) //

I never see the threat too soon
The blood on the bandage, the ghost in the room
Got a canvas as white as the moon
But when I see it at night, it's a sickening blue

I was thinking people never change
But there's a new taste of dread that I cannot explain
And the thoughts that make up my life
Get reflected in others from time to time

Now I've got another question
And if we run out of time, can we make an exception
For the piece that needs completion?
And I want to hear more from you, here's what I'd like to do

Oh, temptation
I could be a part of you
(Can't take a message)
Oh, completion (Can't take a message)
Come in closer
Let the candle burn right through
(Can't take a message)
If you can't get what you're after any other way (Can't take a message)

Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
Covered under your sleeve sometime
Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
Alright, I was really a mistake tonight

I won't speak, I don't know what to say
I can see in your prayers, it's the same things we pay for
Got a currency that you accept
If you want to exchange, we can try to connect
Give me the number to your room and leave the door on the latch
There are tigers in the jungle, there's a knife in the mattress
I don't think we broke the glass but hell if I know
I never learned to dance, what the hell do I know?

I know I won't always need you like this
I swear I'm not always falling to bits
But, but in the hallway the moment hits
And the set-up clicks like a safety

Yeah, you could hear a pin drop, feel it
I feel it, you'll feel it
You'll feel it
I feel it, you'll feel it
Feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, two, three, four

Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
I was really in a state tonight
Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
I'm alright, one day hope I see you sometime
Old time, sometime, all the time, no time

Oh, temptation
I could take a piece from you

Oh, completion
Let it burn, let the candle burn right through

// Hollywood //

I'm sick of violence
Sick of money
Sick of drinking
Sick of drugs
Sick of fucking
Sick of staring at the ads on the bus

Hollywood makes me wanna puke
Hollywood makes me want to-

You got a face that you think
Will last as long as the sphinx
But the poster's painted over in a week if it stinks
So let the people decide
On a metro ride
Because everyone's an artist but
No one has the time, yeah

Everywhere I go I'm oppressed by these energies
Like it? Yes I love it
I hear music in my head
Is that a gun?
(You stepped in his gum)
Are my earbuds on the fritz?
There's a hiss on the bus
And it goes round

Hollywood makes me wanna puke
Hollywood makes me wanna puke
Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood

Faces form faces
Phrases come in phases
Take me to the palace
Make me think I'm famous

Okay
Hop inside!
(Come see my movie!)
Hop inside!
(Come see my movie!)
Hop inside!
(Come see my movie!)
(Catch a ride)
It's kinda groovy

You can't disengage with one single aspect
Watching from the sidelines
Supervising lines
Why don't you take what you can get?
No disruptions on the set
You're gonna wind up back home
Where your fear splits in two like Moses

Into Mansons and Monroeses
Logic and hypnosis
Good and evil
Only people
They don't talk about the
12 year olds on pills waking up in beds with big producers
I can make you famous
I can make you something

Don't go back to Oklahoma
What's in Oklahoma?
You know this is not for
Public consumption
You know nothing
This is nothing
That's the slogan
If you're suffering
If you're hungry for something
It's nothing
Don't you watch the news or even movies?
You do?
Me too

// Hymn (Remix) //

I feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart

(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)
(Feel it in my)

If I give this up
Will I be safe?
Will my life be spared?

I feel it in my heart (Oh, I won't take its place)
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart (I won't take its place)
Feel it in my heart (I won't take its place)

// Martin //

Justin
I will find you
In the winter
I will find you
When the world is asleep inside
I will wake my eyes to starlight
I will find you
I will

Justin
Light is falling
In the morning
Someone's calling
I will find strength in your power
I'll stop running like a coward
I will find you
I will

Just when I think I'm gone
You change the track I'm on
Just when I think I'm done
You burn me up before the dawn

Justin
There's no answer
In the end, I know
There is no answer
And when I'm high on things that bug me
The morning news and instant coffee
I'll forget, and forget, and remember
Forget, I will never forget
The way you made me feel

I turn the page
Every pen mark leaves a trace
Stars turn in place
I turn the page
Every pen mark leaves a trace
Stars turn in place
I still can see your face

// Deadlines (Thoughtful) //

I am not awake
I am not asleep
I am not so shallow
I am not that deep

Do you wanna dance?
Someone shut the door
On the losing side
Of some sort of war

He said, "I'd like to do this for a living
But I don't know how"
Why would all the commercials
Sleep in our beliefs

There was a predestined set of symbols
Taking in the place of Prom Queen crown in the background
Stepping out in front, a pair of Vans took me to your place
Your eyes help me

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
Old compassion
It's transforming me into

No long reflection
Swearing all I see is you

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
Old compassion
It's transforming me into

Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(I think I'm on to something)
Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(Shut up)
(Shut the fu-)
Old compassion
It's transforming me into
(Shut, shut up)
(Hey)

// What's With You Lately //

Oh, I never heard back from you

He looks like you but he's not
And he's in your seat
He's copying your style
But he doesn't know the first thing

You know, a couple of the guys
Were thinking about moving away
'Cause there's less and less here
That seems like it's a reason to stay

You're not the only one who's angry
You shut the door, they call you crazy
You always said, "They'll never break me"
What's with you lately?

// Life Worth Missing //

As if on cue
They lit a firework
The sky reeled back
And I ran fast to get to you

I think you knew
Before the war began
What loving to run towards
Something can do to a man

Fall over the edge
Learn to live while falling
Every life is a path worth following
When you put into words
It's comfortingly bland
There's so little left to understand

When we're strung up, hanging
From the knots we've allowed
We call up our angels to cut us down
If you could be proud of anything you've done
What would it be?
Then you disappear and we are up in the clouds

I feel the tension shock right through my body
I am wide awake
Trippin' meant for me

I thought one day
I thought I'd find a hole
In my own backyard
I'd never seen before
Follow it down
Underneath that fence
Come back up on the other side
Live another life

Break down the door, it's yours for the taking
I held it back until you stopped asking
My eyes are blurred, the clock is ticking
I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing
I hear women in my head with ordinary names
That ring like magic to somehow function in my brain
Your hands were warm though you came in from the cold
I took one and held it and suddenly I started to shake
Shake
Shake
Shake
Sha-ake

I feel it break, I feel the weight
Of anger, pain and sorrow
Breaking out of me

The flags are raised
We fought with no more advice
And no tomorrows
This is destiny

Memories of the best regrets
I played my song in every single way
Every note of the symphony

Men will fence with the best of grace
And it's pleasantries to the bottom of the page
I'm sorry

// There Must Be More Than Blood //

I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw
I saw, I saw
I saw, I saw you, I saw you

On the magazine cover, with your
Blue-white eyes
Read it from cover to cover
Looking for ya
But these are not my people here
I think you know that
Nervous like a wild dog
Waiting for the attack

I was living in the delta
Wasting most of my time
You know if I could close the blinds right
I could sleep all through the night
But I've seen the tides are rising
Where once there was a shore
I can still remember houses
Stripped to the floor

There must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
Of this much I am certain

When you're down for awhile trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
When you're out for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
You were playing your music but you got drowned out
You go back to the old house but you've been locked out

And it wasn't for love that you went back home
It was the guilt in your throat like you swallowed a bone
They had all of your life to get it right
They had all of that time just to change their minds
And you're grateful for the bus, it's a place to sit down
Like a spider in the winter trying not to be found
No use trying to heal when you're getting stepped on
No use selling your soul when you're getting passed on

How could they treat you like a forgotten card?
Dear Dad, I'm sorry
Thank you very much
What difference does it make when they throw you away?
Is anybody ever gonna hear what you had to say?

I was flying on a redeye
My hand dropped to the aisle
I could see myself clearly
For the first time in awhile
There was nothing but lines
Nothing but outlines
My gut sank like a stone
But I heard another voice say
"We all walk alone"

There must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
There must be more than fear
Oh, there must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
There must be more than fear

There must be more, there must be more, there must be
There must be more, there must be more, there must be
Must be more, there must be more, there must be
There must be more, there must be more, there must be

No one can see
Matter
Please let this matter
No one can see this
Or know that I need it

Nowhere to turn
Nowhere to turn
Nowhere to turn
Nowhere to turn

I need a break
I need a life that's right
I need to wait
(Any amount of money to get away from here)

I'm tired of coming home safe
Someone will care about this
Please let somebody care about this
