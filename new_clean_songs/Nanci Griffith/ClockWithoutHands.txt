Album: ClockWithoutHands

// Clock Without Hands //

I am a clock without hands
I'm walking through the midnights
Counting all the moments
Of the loves I've left behind
Crying on the shoulders of the days
I've not forgotten now

I am frozen in time
Like the battles of the soldiers
Left displaced of time
Where their tears still fall
Loves that wreck out on the track
Far beyond my looking back to recall
I'm just a clock upon the shelf
Without hands to give the time of day
For love at all

I am a clock without hands
No one understands this
That when the autumn comes
I see no reason for a fall
Spring can fail to move me
With its tulips and its clover
Now the time for love is over
I am a clock without hands
I'm just tickin' and that's all

I recall a time
When love still had the power
To reach inside this clock
Where my hands held a dream
The innocence of passion
And the words of Saint Teresa chiming in
And I recall the faith
Of the love of my life
And the losing of my hands
Which he took with him when he died
I'm crying on the shoulders of his love
That I'm remembering now
It's been ages since this heart has ticked a beat of love
So I've forgotten how

// Traveling Through This Part Of You //

Nothing that I've ever seen
Now means much of anything
In traveling through this part of you
And the Vietnam that I had dreamed
The place you wore your life "fatigued"
I'm traveling through this part of you

Where are you amongst this madness
On the streets of Saigon?
Where were you in 1969?
When I was but a youth
Oh, here were you
You were traveling through this part of you

I'll make my way now on my own
Back to my home to live alone
I have traveled through this part of you
Yet, I will save this time and place
For the time when I can say
I traveled truth this part of you

You were an American boy
Whose innocence was lost here in the wat
And I wear your scars
While traveling through this part of you

Nothing that I've ever seen
Now means much of anything
In traveling through this part of you
And the Vietnam that I had dreameed
The place you wore your life "fatigued"
I'm traveling through this part of you
I'm traveling through this part of you
I'm traveling through this part of you

// Where Would I Be //

Tell me where
Would I be now without you
Without an angel
Watching out for me

Took a long, long time
For me to realize
All my faith in you
Was so justified

Tell me where
Would I be without you
Where would I turn
To find the truth I need

I could never go back
To where I used to be
I've got so used to having
All the love you give to me

Tell me where
Would I be without you now

And every time I stumble or fall
I call your name and you'll be there
Or if I should fly too high
I know your love will reach me anywhere

I could never go back
To where I used to be
I've got so used to having
All the love you give to me

Tell me where
Would I be now without you
Would I be lost
Just drifting out to sea

If I could start all over
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause I know you'll always
Be there through thick and thin

Tell me where
Would I be without you now

// Midnight In Missoula //

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Where the Black Hills know your name
Is the snow piled high around your window frame?
Is there enough frost left to write our names upon the pane?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

I am down in Rio where I cannot find the sky
Our savior on that mountaintop has taught my soul to fly
I am singing Gershwin and children's lullabies
And wondering of you
And if you're sleeping in Missoula tonight?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

I'd love to climb your hilltop and look out upon Missoula lights
Sing Samuel Barber melodies with your viola sweet and high
But I am off to Liverpool on an early evening flight
And wondering of you
And if you're sleeping in Missoula tonight

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Where the Black Hills know your name
Is the snow piled high around your window frame?
Is there enough frost left to write our names upon the pane?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

Are you sleeping now?
Do you know how much I love ya?
Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

// Lost Him In The Sun //

Any given day there's a jet flying somewhere
Oh, we bought a ticket and vanished in the sky
And how was I to know he was leaving in the morning
I never heard him go and then he never said goodbye
I've learned to love the night cause the light's gonna get ya
Right between the eyes in the morning like a gun
And reaching out your hand and he's not there beside you
Oh, what can I say, I lost him in the sun
Hey and what have I done?
I lost him in the sun
I lost him in the sun

Oh, I lost him in the sun
Oh, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun

Fire up your hearts cause the wind is getting cold
It always get cold for the riders of the night
You carry that scar when you know what lonely is
Looking for a home like a bird, like a bird in flight
Oh, and what have I done?
Yeah, I lost him in the sun
Yeah, I lost him in the sun

// The Ghost Inside Of Me //

Every prayer that I'm not praying and every promise I'm betraying
Every price that I am paying, is like a ghost inside of me
Every road I could be taking, every dream I am forsaking
Every heart that's out there breaking, is like a ghost inside of me

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
Every time I look around
There is something haunting me

Every friend I am deserting and every danger I am flirting
Every word that ends up hurting, is like a ghost inside of me
Every heart I could be cheering and every love that I am fearing
Every cry I am not hearing, is like a ghost inside of me

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
If every time I look around
There is something haunting me

Every tear that I'm not crying and every pain I am denying
Every lie I'm justifying, is like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me

// Truly Something Fine //

Oh, love is a hand you hold
When you think you've lost your mind
It is bitter as persimmons
Yet as sweet of rose on vine
It's the thorns upon the vines
That sometimes tear two hearts entwined
It's a gentle breath upon your cheek
That is so truly fine

Love is something truly fine
Love is love and truly blind
Love is only human kind
Love is something truly fine
Oh, love is something truly fine
Something never looked to find
Yet truly something fine

You and I are roses
Chose to wither on the vines
With you, you're back to love
With me, I've run from mine
We are some kind of weather
You're the storm blown 'cross my life
I am leaf of autumn
A fallen tear of something fine

From the shallows of the Mekong
To my Liffey, Dublin's wine
The tide turned me around
And brought the taste of something fine
And something's truly lost
As I'll not try to change your mind
The thorns of taking chances
Made it something truly fine

// Pearl's Eye View (The Life Of Dickey Chapelle) //

Oh, she was high up there in the air
Caught still by a soldier's stare
Whenever it was men amongst men
Down upon the land
And she followed those mothers' sons
She felt the thunder of their guns
From a pearl's eye view, just a camera in her hand
She was born Georgette but the name
Didn't suit her well
So, she blew out of Wisconsin as Dickey Chapelle

So, she flew with a pilot's pride
The first witness to either side
She carried relief to the lost ones
Between the bombs
And we saw it all through her lens
She knew she'll go back again
When the call rang out once more from Vietnam
She's been through this before
She'll tell ya war is hell
Her pearl earrings caught the light
On Dickey Chapelle

Oh, that's the way it was
She was the only one to tell
In 1962
She blew the whistle loud and clear
Now we trace her wings
In her footsteps without fear
To the front lines where she fell
Where she lies still
But she's still there

It was 1965
Over Chu Lai in a free fall dive
In a dawn patrol to cover the dead zone ground
She tiptoed through the land mines
All along the enemy lines
But she never saw the one that took her down
She captured the bloody pearls of war so well
That war was bound to steal the end of Dickey Chapelle

Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle

// Roses On The 4th Of July //

He still sends her roses on the 4th of July
They're always white roses and she never asks why
She still doesn't know where he goes Thursday nights
But his wedding band rests, on the bedside that night

He was a soldier in the Vietnam war
He lost half his right leg whilst daydreaming of her
She lit a candle each holy hour he was gone
"You Were On My Mind" was their favorite song

Love is a mystery
From birth till we die
It's cross words of a morning
By evening entwined
It's all that we dream of, sometimes it's not right
Love is white roses and you never ask why

He's the hands of a draftsman, he's built a good life
She works for a season during IRS time
Two children they've had though their boy has now died
When they wake of each morning, he's still on their minds

Their friends would all tell you they're like day and night
Their daughter's an actress, she is strong and she's bright
He meets with his pals from the war Thursday nights
She still treasures those roses every 4th of July

Love is white roses every 4th of July

// Shaking Out The Snow //

Snowing - through Dakota I once drove
With the wife of my best pal
Who cloaks her heart from cold with gold
It was well into the winter
Of December in the cold
Off to see Mount Rushmore staring through the snow
And to gamble with the boys of Deadwood
As we drove

Snowing - I am shaking out the snow
Oh, the cold that is within my heart
I'm gonna shake out all that snow
Riding years ago
Through those South Dakota roads
When the laughter could thaw Enderby
And shake me from the snow
Like a hurricane through Florida
I'll shake out all this snow

Snowing - one Christmas morn' when I was four
My brother told me it was warm
So a swimsuit I adorned
Then he sent me to the weather
And behind me locked the doors
A four year old in a swim suit and brand new plastic skates
Out into the snow to catch this cold
I cannot shake

Snowing - yeah, it snows in Tennessee
The place where I now make my life
Is still snowing down on me
I'd prefer Antarctica
Perhaps the land of Enderby
Where the weather is my heart and I'm closer to the sea
Since I cannot ever seem to shake the snow
Out of me

And all across the states you see the tractors and the plows
Clearing out the roads
And the bridges north and south
Something they did learn
And I just don't seem to know
How to clear a passage
And shake out all the snow

// Armstrong //

Black boy in Chicago
Playing in the street
Not near enough to wear
Not near enough to eat
Don't you know he saw it
He saw a man named Armstrong
Walk upon the moon

Young girl in Calcutta
Barely eight years old
The flies that swarm the market place
Will see she don't get old
Don't you know she heard it
On that July afternoon
She heard a man named Armstrong
Had walked upon the moon
He heard a man named Armstrong
Had walked upon the moon

The rivers are getting dirty
The wind is getting bad
Wars and hate are killing off
The only earth we have
But the world all stopped to watch it
On that July afternoon
To watch a man named Armstrong
Walk upon the moon
To watch a man named Armstrong
Walk upon the moon
To watch a man named Armstrong
Walk upon the moon

And I wonder if a long time ago
Somewhere in the universe
They watched a man named Adam
Walk upon the earth

// Last Song For Mother //

If I promise not to cry
Will you look me in the eye
And tell me that you've known me?
I was your late, your lonely child
I am enhanced by all you've shown me

And in my youth I did defy you to the end
Please forgive my wildness then
Even I can't comprehend
What a mother's love has lent
To all that is me

And will you sing this song again?
Let us sing it hand in hand
While the band is till playing
Before the light can loose your hand
Before I lose my voice again
Let us sing while it's playing

And if I promise not to cry
Please look me in the eye
And say you've truly known me
'Tis the sweet sound of goodbye
Amazing grace how sweet the sound

Between your soul and mine
If I promise not to cry
If I promise not to cry
