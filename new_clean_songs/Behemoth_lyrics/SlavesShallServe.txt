// Slaves Shall Serve (Album Version) //

Father ov Terror!
Aba ol-Hol
Enter the pylon
Through the galleys ov past
Catacombs ov night
Into the starry womb

Slay, slay!
Asar un-Nefer
We have no fear
Our time had come
Our will is done

Dance, dance!
O Mighty One
In the fields ov Aqert
And spit
Upon slaves ov death

War God!
Trample all weakness
This is your day ov pride
Draw Thy flaming sword
Cut the umbilical cord
To set me free from eternal sleep

[Lead: Seth]

...Step by step
[Khem:] Evolution: spiral vibration
Can you hear?
Can you touch?
Can you see?
Can you really see?

We charm all jins -
Automata, inprinted realities
They creep like snakes
And all we feel
Is painful bliss
As we burn forth
Like winged globe
Like solar disk...
...And penetrate eternity

[Lead: Nergal]

Slaves shall serve!

// Entering The Pylon Ov Light //

Earth bedewed with seed ov death
Sheds the blood red tears
And I saw the hearth ov youth
Painfully torn out by the mighty Apep
Heart which still wants to live

Here, among the sonorous chorals
Ov mourning clothed with rain ov blood
Innocence touches the heart
But this touch penetrates only empty air
There is no life but time for a shadow
And time for a night

Mithras, Abraxas, Phallos
Serpent power, awake the dawn
Rise the pyramids ov the inmost flame
To break through
Illusions ov life and the phantoms ov death

To exist is not given to you
Oh, Asar, you are the Past One
Go and dwell among the sorrows ov Asi
Awaken I dream and see sleeping gods
And I draw the curtains ov all worlds
The veil of Isis and thou art as Persephone
Who touches the flowers ov the underworld
Yeah! I descend into the depths ov thought
To find thee in the kingdoms ov Hades
In the labyrinth ov mind
To bring thee to life, to give a form
To incarnate into the flesh
To give priceless jewels, by sages called delight
And the senses ov the earth

// Penetration //

"Seeing things in my whole life, images exploding. You have been chosen."

"We are free."

Endemion - magical son
Nothing here is real
Lasts forever
Shining like gods
New body, new blood
The fire that I feel
Armageddon
Vision

Penetrating me
Penetrating you
Penetrating deep

Look out

"What's happening is real.
You can't stop them.
What do you think, we just go on forever?"

Ziarahs are all burning ahead
Illuminating ways
I've not dreamed before
Eternals are inviting me in
I see images of you burn forever
Can't contain

Penetrating deep - generating me
Penetrating you - let go

We must go back now
Make my entrance one way
And I can't look in
And I can't look back
We cannot stop, no
Black out
Listen

[Repeat:]
"We have confirmed angel touchdown. The place is completely ablaze of fire. It's like hell down here. I think we're going straight for the fucking light."

Penetrating deep
Penetrating me
Penetrating you
Again

// Until You Call On The Dark //

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be your emptiness
I wanna be the god who kills
I wanna be the Christ who dies
Upon the fires
Of infamy
Can't you see it
Can you feel it

Until you call on the dark

Can't you see it now
How black your future will be
And every emissary that i send you
Will bleed

I wanna be your misery
I wanna be the world you fear
I wanna be the Christ who dies
Upon the fires
Of infamy
Can you see it
Can't you feel it

Until you call on the dark

// Demigod (Live) //

Behold! children ov Cain
All beings not ov reptilian form
Be upon them!
Spare none! mercy cast aside!
Those who feareth not my sacred blade
Shall be blessed

Repent not!
Thou art man
God is no more
Rise now above the weakness ov flesh
Come forth! join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy
Follow the One
Who spurred Roman warring legions

Rise up! o power from sea below all seas
SIRIUS! DRACONIS!
Awake from everlasting dream!
Spirits ov abomination
Formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things

Chthonic gods! those from beyond the stars
Commander ov hosts devour the flesh ov man
May their weapons melt like wax
May their tongues be torn apart
May Apophis grind their bones
May their ashes be scattered all around...

Hear me! o vermin!
How couldst Thou fall so low?
Redemption through denial
Restriction becomes a sin
Mankind! so pure...
Castrate Thy impotent god
Vomit forth the blasphemy
And forever shalt Thee win

// Slaves Shall Serve (Live) //

"Slaves Shall Serve As Crowns Are Falling,
As The Apocalypse Is Nearing,
Slaves Shall Serve As Inferior Life Force,
Slaves Shall Serve As Undead Rivals"

Father ov Terror!
Aba ol-Hol
Enter the pylon
Through the galleys ov past
Catacombs ov night
Into the starry womb

Slay, slay!
Asar un-Nefer
We have no fear
Our time had come
Our will is done

Dance, dance!
O Mighty One
In the fields ov Aqert
And spit
Upon slaves ov death

War God!
Trample all weakness
This is your day ov pride
Draw Thy flaming sword
Cut the umbilical cord
To set me free from eternal sleep

Step by step
Evolution: spiral vibration
Can you hear?
Can you touch?
Can you see?
Can you really feel?

We charm all jins -
Automata, inprinted realities
They creep like snakes
And all we feel
Is painful bliss
As we burn forth
Like winged globe
Like solar disk...
...And penetrate eternity

Slaves shall serve!
