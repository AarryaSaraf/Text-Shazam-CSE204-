Album: OpvsContraNatvram

// Post-God Nirvana //

O libertine
Thy will be done
Shed the bondage ov vulvic slavery
Grind down the walls
Which veil the sun
Conquer today, my brethren, fearlessly

Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx
Hoc Signo Fertote Lvx

And so the sun rose in the West
Only for its blinding light to grow weary in the East
With passions subduing all speech in awe
We worship the devil, we hail the beast

// Malaria Vvlgata //

Let all bibles preach the sermon ov vengeance
Let the hallowed verses call for war
Behold as seraphs fall from ebonising skies
Let's stab the world and halt the cosmic lie

Spare no one
Show them no pity
Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
Hostibvs hvmani natvrae
Begone, all ye fucking cowards

Myself, I am a foe to all your piety
Anointed by the radiance ov warring Mars
Submerged, I am into oceans ov enmity
I'll find no peace in here until I ram the luminous stars

Spare no one
Show them no pity
Tooth for a tooth
Eye for an eye
Hostibvs hvmani natvris
Annihilate the crux ov the untruth

O death
Thou art so quiet that it hurts
Pale, proud and so immaculate
Beyond all contemplation
Beyond perception
Come forth
Eradicate

We shall trample all over thee
Spreading exhortations mightier than the sword
Each word revolts against god-fearing helotry
Restoring the hegemony ov primordial law

// The Deathless Sun //

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun

My god is the all-devouring pyre
My goddess dwells in Hadean somber tides
Burst forth from the crushing depths as Leviathan
And then descend into the bowels of the Earth
The imperial throne is set to dominate
The powers of ruthless zephyr forever shall reign

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Divinvs, the deathless sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Divinvs, the deathless sun

My god is the all-consuming fire
Fated centre of the bottomless pit
He's the void beyond any cipher
Starless night, immortally lit
When the throne of the carnal world is restrained
The powers of ruthless zephyr forever shall reign

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

I am nothing
Without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

Let's drink to he of the shining morn
To the lacerated yet so divine
To the sun that evermore shall rise
To my ascent, to thy demise

I am nothing
But without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the undying sun

I am nothing
But without him, nothing is
I am no one
It is he, Sol Invictvs, the deathless sun

// Ov My Herculean Exile //

A blinded hermit in oblivion, disgraced
Like Odysseus lost in Poseidon's endless domain
In a realm devoid ov solace, I roam
But these sorrows are mine and mine alone
Wayward like a forlorn mutt astray
Stertorous I heave Atlas' torturous weight
I am lost in a moment and the moment is lost in me...
But I shall endure new life in my agony

With anima sprawled open
With corpvs violently split
I bled for you
Now you bleed for me

I do not possess the prowess ov mighty bards and poets
Void ov ambition to evangelise
Yet there's poetry in my blasfemia to be freed
So chant on ye filthy whores, profane and so malign

With anima sprawled open
Corpvs ov boundless rifts
I wept for you
Now you weep for me

With hearts profoundly scorched
Wounds weeping sanguine
I burnt for you
Now burn without and within

Lend thy ear onto me
And heed my prayer
Incline thy all-seeing eye
And heed my call
This war cry could never be silenced
But weep no more my brethren
Thy herculean labor shall endure forevermore
(Forevermore)

Shall endure forevermore
(Forevermore)

// Neo-Spartacvs //

No god reigns over me
I am heathen below
Hear the drums ov war
Ov coming Abaddon

No god reigns over me
Mine is the sanctity below
Hear the drums ov war
I am the clenched fist ov Spartacvs

I forge ahead
Like a meteor adrift in cold decay
Thou must heed the call

(Ordo ab vniverso)
I hail the freedom the gods abhor
To feel greater
To strive higher
To be more

Burn Troy, burn
Savor ashes ov Zion scorched
(Πυρός καί θείου)

Burn Troy, burn
To rubble, tear it down
Cherubs forlorn (Unholy, unholy)
They mourn

I forge ahead
A lost Sisyphus in cosmic fatum
I travail
To and fro

(Γνῶθι σαὐτόν)
I worship the knowledge that gods abhor
To feel greater
To strive higher
To be more

Burn Roma, burn
Savor ashes ov Zion torched
(Ave sanctvs Ignis)

Burn Roma, burn
To rubble, tear it down
(Hannibal ad portas)
Seraphim thrown aground

No god reigns over me
I am heathen below
Hear the drums ov war
Ov coming Abaddon

No god reigns over me
Mine is the sanctity below
Hear the drums ov war
I am the clenched fist ov Spartacvs

No god may cast it's shadow upon us
We, the proud and the few
I am Spartacvs
And so are you

// Disinheritance //

Tantrum, from which the New Man shall be formed
The orphaned blue blood ov the celestial
Who shuns the burdens ov them sainted whores
Shall manifest its splendors from barren soil

Behold his arrival, the Arcadian stray
Reeking refuse ov your tender age
Marches forth and inseminates
Thy ophidian conclave

What is liberty
But when the gods grow sick ov us?
What is mutiny
If not breaking off the shackles ov the gods?

Xαῖρε Ἕσπερε!
Xαῖρε Φώσφορε!

Contemplating millennia past
I wandered through wastelands astray
In company ov that, larger than the gods
With animus that just won't wither away

What is liberty
But when the gods grow sick ov us?
What is mutiny
If not breaking off the shackles ov the gods?

Xαῖρε Ἕσπερε!
Xαῖρε Φώσφορε!

Inquisition in the name ov freedom
Decimation in the name ov democracy
Hidden daggers and poisoned wine
All in the name ov fraternity

Hidden daggers and poisoned wine
All in the name ov fraternity

// Off To War! //

Am I ov God or Satan, or an obsidian hemisphere?
Am I the fated sovereign or sanctitude inverse?
Consider the great solitude ov the truly liberated man
Set forth to raze frail humanity once again

Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll draw blood from stone
Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll be the thundering tremor to whip the storm

Why are we such tender flesh under blackening skies?
Are we defenceless prey in a predator's eye?
Can we stay stalwart in the face ov fated tragedy?
Are we to remain subjugated by fictitious morality?

Am I to act alone?
If so, I'll separate the meat from bone
Am I to act alone?
If so, I shall be the herald ov reckoning's swarm

Host ov the ones condemned
Dethrone god malevolent
Hear the cannons roar
We are off to war
Uncrown he with reins adorned
Blacken the icon
We for whom no god shall mourn
Off to war

Am I ov God or Satan, or an obsidian hemisphere?
Am I the fated sovereign or sanctitude inverse?
Consider the great solitude ov the truly liberated man
Set forth to raze frail humanity once again

// Once Upon A Pale Horse //

I'll ascend
As the sun into the night
I'll appear
On a pale horse alight
Skyward, I climb alone
Yet, bound forever to this Earth
Quench my unholy thirst
To will is to dissent

I'll ascend
As the sun into the night
I'll appear
On a pale horse alight

Go forth
And conquer
In thy own name
For thy own flesh
Forsake shame
Forsake guilt
Do what thou wilt

Onwards, driven by doubt
Carving my beastly ways
Never will I submit
To will is to disobey
Hail empower thyself
Strive forever to more
And make heel the universe
So the last will be the first

Onwards, driven yet calm
Carving malevolent ways
Never will I submit
To will is to disobey

Go forth
And conquer
In thy own name
For thy own flesh
Forsake shame
Forsake guilt
Do what thou wilt

Go forth
And conquer
Forsake shame
Forsake thy fucking guilt

For love is the law
Love under will

// Thy Becoming Eternal //

O blest be thou, as vast as the night
(In nomine igni)
Thou who dost spawn the infernal and divine
(In odivm fidei)
O blest be thou, as bright as light
(In absentia christi)
Armadas ov rebellion align

I shall bathe myself in wine and gold
I will tear the arteries ov cosmos so it may bleed
Behold the malignant salvo ov my crimes
Abysmal eons that have wandered by
Where would I seek the truth but here
Where mutiny and chaos bloom?

I satiate the ferocious hunger ov the beast
(In nomine igni)
Cast the flock in great fury upon the Earth
(In odivm fidei)
From South to North, from West to East
(In absentia christi)
In unity my fleets traverse

I shall cause thine overwhelming hatred to consume
Among the sainted legions where black hearts ignite
Forsooth, the branches ov this wretched tree I'll wound
And rob its pestilential scions ov their lives
Where should I seek the truth but here
Where mutiny and chaos bloom?

Be praised
O be glorified
Exalted, honoured and lionised
Breathe in and breathe out
Cleansing fire from within and from above
Thy becoming is eternal
The thrusting spear disinheriting the meek
By the name ov the borneless one
We hail Satan
We hail thee

// Versvs Christvs //

He, who is
From another light
He is the bellow
Ov a shooting star

He who impels
Frenzied storms to cease
Behold, Qasidah
For our lord Iblis

I've sworn to be a channeler ov thy rays
I have succumbed like a moth to the flame
For my legions demur to submit
I am thy devotee, o lord in the abysmal pit

Sever the tongue
Ov Cicero
Gauge out
Copernicus' eyes

Stone Shakespeare
For the heresy ov his scrawl
Undo the surge
Mar the tide

Wingless
With feet upon the horizon
Let's rise at morn
Herald the Sun
Render unto Caeser
The things that are Caesar's
Deliver man all spoils ov the divine

Magnificamvs te
Versvs Christvs
Tibi deo satanae

Confuse, we shall live in tongues
Devitalize the populist mandates
O demagogues ov miserable worth
No seed will bloom upon mother Earth

No grain will  blossom in the daylight
The Sun shall perish, turning cold
And when the desert typhoon smother final gospel
Rise up, thou wicked
And blow the doomsday horn

Wingless
With feet upon the horizon
Let's rise at morning
To herald the Sun

Gebt dem Kaiser
Was des Kaisers ist
Deliver man all spoils ov the divine

Magnificamvs te
Versvs Christvs
Regnamvs tibi lvcem ferre
Tibi deo avrorae

He, once banished, forever shall return
He, once fallen shall rise again
And at the hour ov our death
The infinite
He shall remain

He, once banished, forever shall return
He, once fallen shall rise again
And at the hour ov our death
The infinite
He shall remain
