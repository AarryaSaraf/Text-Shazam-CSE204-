// It's A Beautiful Day //

It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah

It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama

Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless - so hopeless to even try

// Made In Heaven //

I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see?

Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh, can't you see?
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes, it was meant to be, yeah

When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies
Break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

Made in heaven

I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody
Everybody tells me so
Yes, it was plain to see
Yes, it was meant to be

Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars

// Let Me Live //

[Freddie Mercury:]
Three, four

[Choir:]
Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

[Freddie Mercury:]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give and all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand-new start?

So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand-new start

[Roger Taylor:]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm asking is a chance to live

[Freddie Mercury:]
(So let me live) so let me live
(Leave me alone) let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me
Make a brand-new start

[Roger Taylor:]
And it's a (long hard struggle)
But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

[Brian May:]
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop living a lie?

[Freddie Mercury:]
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love?)

(Go for it, baby)

Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

Let me live
Let me live
Come on
Let me live

[Choir:]
In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece)
(Take another piece
Take another piece)
Oh, why don't you
Take another piece
(Take another piece, piece of my heart)

[Freddie Mercury:]
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand-new start
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby
All you do is take
(Let me live) Ooh ooh, let me live
(Oh yeah, yeah) Let me live

// Mother Love //

[Freddie Mercury:]
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life
Is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman
Gives me sweet mother love ah ha

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world
And they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy
And my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me
All the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha mother love

[Brian May:]
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

(Mother love, mother love
Love, love, love, love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm going back to the things
I learned so well in my youth

// My Life Has Been Saved //

This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go (here we go)

We're right back
Where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray, hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page, oh
Oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved

My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life
My life has been saved

// I Was Born To Love You //

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day (Day, day, day, day, day)
Alright, hey-hey!

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity, ah
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me

An amazing feeling
Coming through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) Yes, I was born to love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
Every single day, day, day, day, day of my life

An amazing feeling
Coming through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life, yeah
I was born to love you
Every single day (Day, day) of my life

Go, woo, I love you babe (Hey!)
(Born to love you)
Yes, I was born to love you, hey!
I wanna love you
Love you, love you
I wanna love you, hey, yeah!
(Ha ha ha ha ha, it's magic!)
(What? Ha ha ha ha)
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
I wanna love you (It's magic!)
(Love you, love you)
Yeah, give it to me

// Heaven For Everyone //

This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection
You come to me
And everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days
Of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me
Soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free
This world could be one
We should bring love
To our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could
Be heaven for everyone

You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

Listen, what people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

// Too Much Love Will Kill You //

I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you if you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster, 'cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Oh, yes!

Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

Yes, too much love will kill you, it'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you and you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul, but here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

In the end
In the end

// A Winter's Tale //

It's winter fall
Red skies are gleaming, oh
Seagulls are flying over
Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney tops
Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon
Up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standing by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind
Of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry
Laughter skipping by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beating on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of, the hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting
In the sky, yeah!
Mountains are zooming higher, uh
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning
And spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable, sends me reeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

Ooh
It's bliss
