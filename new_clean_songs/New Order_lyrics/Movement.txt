Album: Movement

// Dreams Never End //

My promise could be your fiend

A given end to your dreams

A simple movement or rhyme

Could be the smallest of signs

We'll never know what they are or care

In it's escapable view

There's no escape so few in fear

Give in a changing value


To be given your sight

Hid in a long peaceful night

A nervous bride for your eyes

A fractured smile that soon dies

A love that's wrong from your life and soul

A savage mine had begun

Hello, farewell to your love and soul

Hello, farewell to your soul


Now I know what those hands would do

No looking back now, we're pushing through

We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see

But never guess how the him would scream

But never guess how the him would scream

But never guess how the him would scream

// Truth //

Oh, it's a strange day

In such a lonely way

I saw some children dance

I watched my life in a trance

And the people around me

Seemed so glad to be here

Will my time pass so slowly

On the day that I fear?


And the noise that surrounds me

Pulls so loud in my head

From the promise that healed us

To the lies that I said

Oh, it's a strange day

In such a lonely way

Some people look down on me,

I know they like what they see


Strange day,

Such a strange day

Such a strange day

// Senses //

My eyes are weary of you before me

I see for their sake, the light of daybreak

It shines upon me, this day we'd all see

No reason ever was given

No reason ever was given


Two ides of recoil, this moment's glory

A failed reminder of a broken story

My vague emotions one day will find

No reason ever was given

No reason ever was given

// Chosen Time //

One day it's now or never

To stay at home

Sometimes the dreams are better

One thing you hold

Believe that all these changes

Keep me alone

What brought the last reaction

I'll never know

I'll never know

I'll never know


Believe me, all I said to you

Believe me, all I did for you

All I did for you

All the times it takes to complain

But live in doubt

Sometimes they keep you waiting

For a look around

I've got a friend in here somewhere

Who can help me out

Believe me, all I said to you

Believe me, all I did for you

All I did for you

// ICB //

My love falls from heaven

To talk of this strange design

Then it goes forever

Where all things never die

People look whenever

These races have been won

Minds just for breathing

When the means for this have begun

It's so far away, and it's closing in

It's so far away, and it seems to travel in


Taken from the killing ground

By all dividing hands

With no sense or reason,

They came, they found, they ran

Taking good advantage of

All the things they are told

I washed my hands of innocence

When you started taking control


It's so far away, and it's closing in

It's so far away, and it seems to travel in

// The Him //

Some days you waste your life away

These times I find no words to say

A crime I once committed filled me

Too much of heaven's eyes I saw through

Only when meanings have no reason

They're taken beyond your sense of right


Small boy kneels, wandering in a great hall

He pays pennance to the air above him

White circles, black lines surround me

Reborn, so plain my eyes see

This is the reason that I came here

To be so near to such a person


I'm so tired, I'm so tired

// Doubts Even Here //

Those steps which seem to take a lifetime

When eyes just turn and stare

The day begins, collapsing without warning

You fade from sight, there's nothing there


No hope allowed, calls are answered daily

Questions are on your side

Deeply moved, beyond all consolation

You felt the pulse, now hear the cry


In my mind, thoughts are becoming clearer

I'm watching every move you make

Counting time spent in observation

A single blow a false mistake


Then you revealed to me

All that I need to know now

(The close went down to times

too, too much behind us)

Then please don't turn away,

Why can't I talk to you now?

(The number of forgotten years

Where my honor isn't deepest

Grows the deepest feeling and it

Grieved for safety and despair)

There's nowhere left to go

Where is this taking her and how?

(The torish threats forevermore

Over our natural favor

And us and he's and I'll fall

Far in it, and it sees enough

In our failures and it's not time.)

There's nothing more I want

To know beyond your trust now

(I missed his promised time again

For my friend)

Don't throw our joy away

Why must you just you leave now?

(Has God forgotten to approach us?

Has He rememberd to not despise us?)

Memories are all that's left

I need you near to me now

(There, now, now, don't come to mind my deeds

And call out in defiance of times gone by)

// Denial //

Here I am in a house full of doors but no exits

In a light that is grey like the stain on my windows

All of this is a gift, such a painful companion

Inside of me


It's just something I know, the answer's not there

It comes and it goes and it frightens me

It's just something I know, the answer's not there

It comes and it goes and it frightens me


This feeling inside me can't confront the decay

To fall down on my knees and resume this charade

Believe me, this distance, it's not  what I need

Inside of me


It's another story, some of it is blurred

I tried to understand him, I tried so hard

Time worked so well upon us inside of me

Inside my soul, Inside my soul


Time worked so well upon us

Inside of me, inside my soul

Inside of me, inside my soul
