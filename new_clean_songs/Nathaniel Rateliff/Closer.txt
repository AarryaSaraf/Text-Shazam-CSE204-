Album: Closer

// Liverpool //

I wish I could know it when
But it don't seem right, hang on
Really it's just in time, and you know it when
It'd have to fade in the night
Do you still sleep on your side

How can I be so far dead
Leaning on one side
I wrote it down but can't remember it
Ain't that the story of our lives
And there's one more prayer and goodnight
And we'll be dead and it turns night
And we'll forget it all in time

// Easy //

Think that you walk in two strides in front of
While everyone else just stand
Youalways pick the right best fruit
And it always rots in your hands
But did you dig through the nest
'Cause the cold man's honey
The sting has got stuck in your head
We could tweeze it them out
Let the swelling go down
But it's probably too late for that

It was mocking every single known
It was filling the space that we left
We don't have to be too bright to see
That it's too cold here to dance
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy

Why don't you draw me a map to nowhere
Well if you know as much as you said
Maybe your talk it ain't that funny
Like the time your burned off all your hair
Or you can hear from the skies
And if it still leaves your mire
Well at least you're an honest man
Well at least you've got something left
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy

I wanna be a marvelous time and
And all my time is spent on
Someone who cannot tell you
And I almost forgot myself
And all in hand, and all it is
It's colliding, nothing else
I want it easy, I want it easy
I want it easy, I want it easy

// Something Beautiful //

I was out
Skippin' stones
In the end it's what you know
Found my feet
They were firm
What you leave is what you burn
Won't find me
In the second verse
Never found me in the first

Away
Does it bound and break
And you look so vain

Broke my heart
Broke my will
It was all so much to fill
Every turn
Every road
It would all lead back to you
Feel my words
Running out
How we end we're livin' down

Away
And I have a say
And it's not too late

Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful

I was out 
In the dust
Kickin' weeds out from the trucks
I was old
You were young 
Who believe it ever come

Away
My hands can take
The trucks and breaks
But there's nothing left of me

Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful 
Show me something beautiful

// Closer //

When I was sick and lonely,
what can admit it's cold
Well I dreamed the sun was shining
as I walked the drifts of snow
don't let it pack on our only love you know

Wishing it was summer
weather this slow pace
come on stop crying;
and wipe the ice from your face.
I don't mind the freeze as long as you're hear to hold
This blanket of frost is going to melt, I know
We know there's some summer breeze
Watching over you and me
in our bitter leaves, we'll be covered

We're closer now,
we're closer now,
than we ever been
We're closer now,
we're closer now,
than we ever been

Than we ever been
where the thaw began
Can I face the wind
That I'm standing in
if I had a guess, it could only get so cold
You can sleep on a bench but maybe your just too old

Well in our frozen slumber
its stillness and its grace
And I whispered of the spring
And the warmth upon your face
When it all starts to melt,
you forget of the ice and snow
When waters rise, they carry you some place warm
I forget our colder dreams, together
and in our summer breeze, we'll recover

We're closer now,
we're closer now,
than we ever been
We're closer now,
we're closer now,
than we ever been,
We're closer now,
we're closer now,
than we ever been
than we ever been

// Winded //

The air I owe
All of it sold and be
My mean too low
And too low to offer you

Honey, I do lay again
All the air I lost in bed
In the end it cuts the same
So call the blows

The air for all
All of its salt in me
My name in rows
They still owe than offering

Oh, to bare themselves again
It's only eyes if nothing's said
In the end I love her name
Heart and all

The air I owe
The air I want to be

Running over me in my head
All the ashes rise again
All the crawling that I did
To come running home

The air I owe
The air I owe
The air I owe it all to you
