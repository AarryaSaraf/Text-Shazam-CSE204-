Album: GiveItUp

// Give It Up Or Let Me Go //

Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door,
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know,
Oh honey, if you want me to love you,
You've got to give it up or let me go.

I know it's useless to be jealous, I couldn't tire you if I tried,
But when I think of you messing behind my back
It brings a pain I just can't hide.
Oh baby, I've been true to you.
And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too.

Well, you come home drunk and nasty, you won't tell me where you've been.
Just when things are nice and sweet, you go back out again.
Why do you wanna mess up a good thing?
I'm gonna find me another man, one who wants to give me everything.

Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door.
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know.
Oh honey, if you want me to love you,
You've got to give it up or let me go.

// Nothing Seems To Matter //

Seems like such a long time since I held you my arms,
And felt you close and warm beside me,
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache
And the memory of you beside me.

Darling, I've never been so blue,
I've tried to see it through,
There's nothing I can do.
I won't make it on my own,
So won't you please hurry home,
'cause nothing seems to matter without you.

Last time I saw you,
There was nothing we could say,
We knew it was a time for a change,
A time to think you said that night,
And I lied and said all right,
I left you in the morning,
I watched you in the window,
And Mexico will never be the same.

It was time to be apart,
But somehow it seems this heart of mine,
Will never find a way to live without you.
And now I'm out here on the road
And I'm feeling bought and sold,
And tonight I just can't but think about you.

Darling, I've never been so blue,
I've tried to see it through,
There's nothing I can do,
I won't make it on my own
So darling won't you hurry home,
Because nothing seems to matter without you.
No, nothing seems to matter without you.

// I Know //

I know you don't love me no more;
No, no more; and I don't
(don't) wanna be hurted any more,
Any more; yeah, yeah,
I've loved so hard, everything I did was no joy; if I can't
Love you right, baby, I don't have to love you at all

I know you don't want me no more, no more
No, no more
And it had to be someone loving you more
Lovin' you more
Ain't no use in me cryin' now all because you have put me down
If you don't want me no more baby, ain't no use in me hanging around.

// If You Gotta Make A Fool Of Somebody //

If you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me
I'm the one that'll worry
[Repeat]

Daytime nitetime
Anytime at all
I'll be there waiting
Anytime you call
Just to be near you
You know
That anywhere I'll go
How could you hurt me so

// Love Me Like A Man //

These men that I've been seeing, baby
Got their soul up on the shelf
You know they could never love me
When they can't even love themselves
But I need someone to love me
Someone to really understand
Who won't put himself above me
Who just loves me like a man

I've never seen such losers, darlin'
Even though I tried
To find a man who could take me home
Stead of takin' me for a ride
And I need someone to love me
I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man

They all want me to rock them
Like my back ain't got no bone
I want a man to rock me
Like my back bone was his own
Darlin', I know you can
Believe me when I tell you
You can love me like a man

I come home sad and lonely
Feel like I wanna cry
I want a man to hold me
Not some fool to ask me why
And I need someone to love me
Darlin', I know you can
Don't you put yourself above me
You just love me like a man

// Too Long At The Fair //

Jesus cried, wept and died
I guess he went up to heaven
I've been downtown such a long, long time
I'll never make it home by seven
Won't you come & take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well I went down to chason's
Walked 'til my feet got sore
I never knew what laughin' was
'til you walked out the door
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

Well, you can give my soul to abraham
Give my soul to saul
Give my bones to canada
My feet they don't hurt at all

I don't know who made the highway
I guess that's just my pride
But I have heard the prince of darkness
On his charger ride

The silver blade is gleamin'
The scales are in his hands
I swear another night is fallin',
Don't you lose another man
Won't you come and take me home
I've been too long at the fair
And, lord, I just can't stand it anymore

// Under The Falling Sky //

Warm and lovely mystery, fire smiling through
Before this moment fades away I want to know you
I've got lightening in my pocket, thunder in my shoe
Have no fear I've got something here I want to show you

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you
And in your eyes the distance left is closing
I've got a feeling in my oceans
Blood underneath my skin
That into your bright fields this prison is opening

Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why
They hope and try - live and die
So leave them in their frozen world
Come and be my lover
If only for one stolen moment
We will live forever

Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?
Voices can no longer hold my desire
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire
Angels wait to take me higher and higher
Higher and higher

// You Got To Know How //

You can make me do what you wanna do
But you got to know how,
You can make me cry, you can make me sigh,
But you got to know how,
You can make me do like this, you can make me do like that,
Woh, baby, but you got to know how.

Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine,
But I got him back, now,
It's the same old song, she couldn't keep him long,
'Cause she didn't know how.
Well, I love my man, I make him holler,
Woh, my,
Yessir, I really know how.

Technique ain't tough, if you care enough,
You can learn to know how,
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint
If you yearn to know how,
Well, don't tell me about the life you led,
Don't try to drink me into bed,
No, baby, no, that ain't the way how.

You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime
If it lasts all night.
I think you'll be ideal when you begin to feel
That you're doin' right.

When you love me right, you hear me holler,
Woh, my,
Yessir, when you really know how.

[Instrumental break]

And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be
When we finally know how,
We'll get a house in town, no need to move around
When we really know how,
Well, there's tricks that I don't even know,
Ones we'll make up as we go.
Woh, mister, when we really know how.
Yes, mister, when we really know how.

// You Told Me Baby //

Told me baby,
You were just too tired to try,
There was nothing left for you to give
And no more tears to cry.

I know she hurt you,
But you know I've been hurt too.
You just come to me, we'll see
What a love can do.

Told me baby,
I was still too young to know,
All the ways that love was going to drag you down,
And just how low I'd go.

In love and time between us,
Makes no difference at all.
You know, You're as desperate to get back up,
As I am not to fall.

Oh, baby, I've been looking for a man like you. . .
Oh, darling,
After all we've been through
There's no one left to fool;
Nothing left for us to do,
Except me and you.

[Instrumental break]

Told me baby,
To find somebody new.
Do you really think that I'd come this far,
Just to lose a man like you?

You know you've got to take a chance,
If only you will stay.
And if you've got the time baby, I've got the love,
We might just find a way [4x]

// Love Has No Pride //

I've had bad dreams too many times
To think that they don't mean much anymore
Fine times have gone and left my sad home
Friends who once cared just walk out my door
Love has no pride when I call out your name

Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again
And I've heard you talk, "she's crazy to stay"
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say

Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again

If I could buy your love, I'd truly try, my friend
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees
Asking for you to come back, I'd be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me

Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
Yes, I'd give anything to see you again
