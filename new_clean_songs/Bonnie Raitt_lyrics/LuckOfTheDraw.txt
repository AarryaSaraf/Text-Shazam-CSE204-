// Something To Talk About //

Ooh, ooh, ooh,
People are talkin', talkin' 'bout people,
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it.
They think we're lovers kept under cover,
I just ignore it but they keep sayin' we...
Laugh just a little too loud,
Stand just a little too close,
We stare just a little too long.
Maybe they're seein', somethin' we don't darlin'.

Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about
(Somethin' to talk about)
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about
(Somethin' to talk about)
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about
How about love?

I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You act so nervous, could you be fallin' for me?
It took the rumor to make me wonder,
Now I'm convinced that I'm goin' under.
Thinkin' 'bout you every day,
Dreamin' 'bout you every night.
I'm hopin' that you feel the same way,
Now that we know it, let's really show it darlin'.

Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about
(Somethin' to talk about)
A little mystery to figure out
(Somethin' to talk about)
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about
How about love?

Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about babe,
A little mystery to figure out.
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about,
How about love? Ooh...
Listen to 'em baby
(Somethin' to talk about)
A little mystery won't hurt 'em
(Somethin' to talk about)
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk
How about our love, love, love, love
Whoowhoo mmmm hey oohh whoowhoo
About love, love, love, love
How about they talk about it? uh huh
Talk about love........

// Good Man, Good Woman //

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Midnight, I'm wound up tight
Slowly comin' down in the daytime
I been lyin' low from work, hangin over from the hurt from you babe
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain, till I get a better thing with you
Darlin, me and you.

So hard to see so far ahead
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed
Gotta find me a good man, a good man, good man. Yeah

You better stop, think about what you're saying
I was seriously dedicated, in the game of playin'
You made ten thousand promises you couldn't keep
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped
Put up with your disrespect and neglect
What an experience, I'll never forget.

Till now, everything I did was wrong (I'm sorry, baby)
Today you're free, but we live alone.
Gotta find me a good woman...Good woman...Good woman...Yeah.

It was twelve o'clock in the midnight hour
I heard the door slam, and then the shower
When I got up, you were already gone
I slipped and fell, from the water you left on.

Gotta find a good woman
Gotta find a good man
Gotta find a goodwoman
Gotta find a good man

// I Can't Make You Love Me //

Turn down the lights;
Turn down the bed.
Turn down these voices
Inside my head.

Lay down with me;
Tell me no lies.
Just hold me close;
Don't patronize.

Don't patronize me.

[Chorus:]
'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't.
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't.
Here in the dark
In these final hours,
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power;
But you won't.
No, you won't.
'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't.

I'll close my eyes,
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me.

Morning will come,
And I'll do what's right;
Just give me till then
To give up this fight.

And I will give up this fight.

[Chorus]

// Tangled And Dark //

Gonna get into it
Down where it's tangled and dark
Way on into it, Baby
Down where your fears are parked.
Gonna tell the truth about it,
Honey that's the hardest part.
When we get through it, Baby
You're gonna give up your heart.

Gonna get into it, Baby
Gonna give them demons a call
Way on into it Baby
Gonna find out once and for all
Gonna get a little risky, Baby
Honey that's my favorite part
When we get through it, Baby
We're gonna give up our hearts.

Well, there's no turnin back,
No turnin back, this time
Well there's no turnin back,
No turnin back

No use in runnin
It's always the same
You can count on the panic
It's the faces that change
To get this love off the block
So take a deep breath
Let's look under the rock

[Repeat 1st verse]

// Come To Me //

All I ever wanted was our love to be true
More than just enough to get me by
I want a love to see me through
I don't need another well-spent night,
Another clever sideways glance
I wanna look my baby in the eye
And know there's nothing left to chance

Well if you're tired of being lonely, beat up and confused
Darling, there's only one thing you can do:
Come to me
Don't be the one who's waiting
Come to me
Babe, I got what you need
Wont you come to me
There won't be no hesitating, babe
I know what you mean to me

I'm gonna hold out for no one
Ain't gonna settle for less
'Cause the kind of love I'm looking for, baby,
You can't fake, you can't finesse
I ain't looking for the kind of man, baby,
Who can't stand a little shaky ground
Who'll give me fire and tenderness
And has got the guts to stick around

Well if you're tired of being lonely, beat up and confused,
Darling, there's only one thing you can-
I got what you want, baby
Oh, and I got what you need
Well if you're tired of being lonely, beat up and confused,
Darling there is only one thing you can do:
Come to me
Be the one who's waiting
Come to me
Ooh, I got what you need
Come to me
There won't be no hesititing, babe
Won't you come to me
I got what you want now, baby
I got what you need
Won't you come
Won't you bring it on home to me
Won't you come
Won't you come on baby, bring it on home to me
Won't you come to me
Bring all of your sweet love home
Won't you come to me

// No Business //

Yes, I'm lonely-hope you don't catch it
Don't want to be down where I last behaved
I broke his heart now I can't patch it
This time it's grave.

I kept track of all the love that I gave him
And on paper, well, it looked pretty good
He left a note that said he couldn't stay here
As if I could...

[Chorus:]
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name
I guess my love's got no business, no business to blame.

One of these days I thought we'd get it together
After all that boy was made for me
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers
Little bird got free.

He always said my love was one sided
I tried to keep up with supply and demand
But there was one way that pie was divided
It was a big piece plan.

[Chorus]

Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby getting illegal
I got the law doggies on my trail
The hawk's out and I could use and eagle
To go my bail.

You say you're itching baby, so go ahead and scratch it
But if its jumps off, don't look at me
You swore to God that I couldn't catch it
But your dog's got fleas.

[Chorus]

// One Part Be My Lover //

When he looks in her eyes
He sees only the truth
Tellin' him he's been living a lie
Over and over like a line in a song
About all the love he let pass him by
To her he might be the man of her dreams
To find what she's been hiding inside
Broken or battered it really don't matter
Her hearts like a wave and he's the tide

[Chorus:]
They're not forever just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away

He's like a boxer who had to retire
After winning but killing a man
All of the moves and none of the courage
Afraid to throw a punch that might land
Not too much later she can't meet his glance
You see her start pulling away
Over and over like fire and ice
One is colored, one is gray

[Chorus]

If you know how why don't you say em' a prayer
They're gonna need all they help they can get
They remember too much about what went wrong
It might be they should learn to forget
Forget themselves in each other
And leave what belongs in the past
Carry thier hearts like a new born child
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.

[Chorus]

One part go away

// Not The Only One //

[Chorus:]
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one.

One chance intervention, see what it can signify
The slightest misapprehension, baby
And we'd have passed each other by
When I heard your sweet voice callin
Saw your light come shinin throught
I couldn't stop my heart from turning
Churnin out my love for you, my love to you.

[Chorus]

True love or perfection
It seems like it's overdue
Then just when you least expect it
It comes sneakin up on you
When I thought that I was dreamin
Felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning
Together till the end of time.

[Chorus]
I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
Feeling that I'd always be the lonely one
When I saw your face through the web of my confusion
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one

// Papa Come Quick (Jody And Chino) //

Papa come quick, Jody's gone to the city
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone
She left a note on the TV and Papa it's a pity
What we gonna do now that Jody's gone.

Mama's been cryin in the kitchen since mornin
She cried right through As The World Turns
I seen it myself and Papa it's a bitch'n
Let's haul ass before the baby gets burned.

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start about half a day
Load up the shotgun, put it in the gunrack
Jody's with Chico down in East LA.

It must've been that wild-eyed, silver-tongued schemer
A girl like Jody don't think for herself.
Him and that Harley and his damn Jalapena
Smokin that stuff'll make you hurt yourself.

Papa come quick
Papa come quick
Papa come quick
Papa come on.

[Repeat 1st verse]

Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map
They got a head start about a half a day
Stop at the Mobil, pump up the flat wheel
Jody & Chico and his ding dang deal.

// Slow Ride //

Feels like nothin happens fast enough
Well maybe I just want too much
But when something's wrong between us, Baby
Nothin feels right.

I think it's time we cleared the air
Take a long drive far away somewhere
Tell me everything you feel inside
We got nothin but time.

Slide over, Baby
Here by my side
I wanna take you on a Slow Ride
On a Slow Ride.

Your history shows on your face
Yeah, you've been hurt you've been betrayed
Now we can't change the past, but we can
Leave it behind.

We'll forget about tomorrow, Baby
We'll just steal away into the night
And we'll just be two shadows, Darlin
In the dashboard light.

Slide over, Baby
Here by my side
I wanna take you on a Slow Ride
On a Slow Ride

// Luck Of The Draw //

You dust the bottles on the bar counter
You're writing screenplays on the side
Three nights a week can keep a girl workin
Sometimes it's good to lose your pride.

These things we do to keep the flame burnin
And write our fire in the sky
Another day to see the wheel turnin
Another avenue to try.

It's in the Luck of the Draw, Baby
The Natural Law
Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
It's in the Luck of the Draw
The Natural Law
(flame keep on burnin)
Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
(wheel ever turnin).

You turn around and say it's last orders
You fix the ribbon in your hair
Tomorrow's letter by the hall doorway
Could be the answer to your prayers.

// All At Once //

Had a fight with my daughter,
She flew off in rage.
Third time this week,
Don't tell me it's the age.
Don't know how I've lost her,
Only know that it's a shame.
Ever since her daddy left,
The girl ain't been the same.

[Chorus:]
All at once I hear your voice,
And time just slips away.
Nothing they can say can hold me here.
Take me where I only feel,
The wind across my face.
Let me know there's some place left for me.
Waiting there for me...

Aww, who'm I kidding?
I should've known he'd never leave.
The time we spend together,
Is harder than the time between.
You wouldn't think it could hurt so,
To see them out the other day.
If that's what he calls leaving...
I guess I threw it all away.

[Chorus]

They say women, we're the stronger.
Somehow we always make it through.
Well, that ain't what I feel right now.
I don't even think it's true.
To me there's lots more broken,
Than anyone can really see.
Why the angels turn their backs on some;
It's a mystery to me.

[Chorus]
