Album: SemperFemina

// Soothing //

Oh, my hopeless wanderer
You can't come in
You don't live here anymore
Oh, some creepy conjurer
Who touched the rim
Whose hands are in the door

I need soothing
My lips aren't moving
My God is brooding

Drawn in chalk across the floor
You made it yours
Your private door to my room
May those who find you find remorse
A change of course, a strange discord resolved

I need soothing
My lips aren't moving
My God is brooding

I banish you with love
I banish you with love

You can't come in
You don't live here anymore

// The Valley //

I know she stayed in town last night
Didn't get in touch
I know she has my number right
She can't face seeing us

She sings in the valley in the morning
Many a morning I have woke
Longing to ask her what she's mourning
Course I know it can't be spoke

Perhaps she's had too much of love
Can be a sickly thing
That's why she mourns the morning dew
And the newness that it brings

She sings in the valley in the morning
Many a morning I have woke
Longing to ask her what she's mourning
Of course I know it can't be spoke

I love you in the morning
I love you in the day
I'd love you in the evening
If only she would stay

We love beauty 'cause it needs us to
It needs our brittle glaze
And innocence reminds us to
Cover our drooling gaze

She's down there in the valley
I know she wanders there
She's down there in the valley
I can see her golden hair

I love you in the morning
My angel of the west
I love you in the evening
And I will do my very best
I'll do my very best

// Wild Fire //

You wanna get high
Yeah overcome those desires before you come to me
I think your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take it all away
You can stop playing that shit out on me

She keeps a pen behind her ear
Because she's got something she really really needs to say
She puts it in a notepad
She's gonna write a book someday

Of course the only part that I want to read
Is about her time spent with me
Wouldn't you die to know how you seem
Are you getting away with who you're trying to be?

Of course there's things upon the Earth that we must really try to defend
You lonely beast
You kind heart
Something we can all trend
I do it all for her, for free
I need nothing back for me
There's no sweeter deed maybe
Than to love something enough to want to have to get free

Is there something on your mind?
Something you need to get by?
D you cry sometimes?
Do you cry sometimes?

You always say you love me most
But I don't know I'm being seen
Maybe someday when God takes me away
I'll understand what the fuck that means
I just know your mama's kinda sad
And your papa's kinda mean
I can take it all away
You could stop playing that shit out on me

Is there something on your mind?
Something you need to get by?
D you cry sometimes?
Do you cry sometimes?

I know your mama's kinda sad
I know your papa's kinda mean
I can take it all away
And you can stop playing that shit out on me

// Don't Pass Me By //

You see my oldest friend
Tell her that I'm gone again
You take my old guitar
One that I once said was ours
Don't be blue

You haul that old tune
One I used to sing for you
When we were alone
You ask her if she knew
Was this something I would do?
From the start

Please don't pass me by
If I'm walking but I don't know why
It something that I have to try
Can you love me if I put up a fight?

Take my old guitar
And sell it off for parts
As you should
Take my old tune
Turn it into something new
Something good

Please don't pass me by
If I'm walking but I don't know why
I can't keep you off of my mind
Can you love me if I put up a fight?

Is it something you've made a habit of?
It's not what I need from love, right now
Right now, right now, right now

// Always This Way //

I'd like to say that I could've stayed
But she didn't want me to
I'd like to know if she had to go
Or if she made a point to

It's so hard to say
"Is it always this way?"
Must every heart break
Like a wave on the bay

Like to think that we're all a link
In what makes the world go round
Lately I wonder if all my pondering's
Taken up too much ground

I make my own way
So at the end of the day
At least I can say
That my debts have been paid

25 years, nothing to show for it
Nothing of any weight
25 more, will I never learn from it
Never learn from my mistakes

It's too soon to say
"Was I always this way?"
Well at the end of the day
My debts have been paid

Now she's gone and I'm all alone
And she will not be replaced
Stare at the phone, try to carry on
But I have made my mistake

At the end of the day
At least I can say
I made my own way
And my debts have been paid

// Wild Once //

They put my hands in water
Told me I'm a god
I might be someone's daughter
Might be somewhat odd

But I was wild once
I know I can't forget it
I was wild, chasing stones

The martyr who feels the fire
And the child who knows his name
They remember that there's something wild
And it's something you can't explain
Oh it's something you can't explain

They are wild
And they can't forget it
They are wild, chasing stones

It's hard if you can't change it
It's worse if you don't try
You will sit down to explain it
And you're constantly asking why
You are constantly asking why

Well, you are wild
And you must remember
You are wild, chasing stones

Does no one understand you?
Is that tired and familial long?
You must change what hands you
Give me something to go on
Give me something to go on

You are wild
And I won't forget it
You are wild, chasing stones

There is something just beneath
There is something just beneath
Something shy and hard to see
It's a ring that is clean
It's a ring

// Next Time //

It feels like a long time since I was free
It feels like the right time to take that seriously
It feels like the trees are a peculiar green
It feels like the air is hung heavily

I don't want to be the kind
Struck by fear to run and hide
I'll do better next time

It feels like warning signs were there for us to see
It feels like they taught us ignore diligently
I feel her, I hear her weakly scream

Am I really so unkind
To turn around and close my eyes?
I'll do better next time
I'll do better next time

It feels like the last breath we will ever share
It feels like the last time I'll run my fingers through you hair

I can no longer close my eyes
While the world around me dies
At the hands of folks like me
It seems they fail to see
There may never
Next time be

// Nouel //

She sings along to sailor's song
In a dress that she made
When she's gone I sing along
But it doesn't sound the same

Oh Nouel, you seem so well
Sing only for me
Fickle, unchangeable
Though I may always be

I pulled a thorn from her tiny paw
Her feet were unclean
Fetch water, blessed twice
And hand that sponge to me

I do well to serve Nouel
Whatever service I may be
Fickle, unchangeable
Weighing down on me

She speaks a word which gently turns
To perfect metaphor
She likes to say I only play
When I know what I'm playing for

Oh Nouel, you must know me well
And I didn't even show you the scar
Fickle, unchangeable
Semper femina

She'd like to be the kind of free
Women can't be alone
I wish I could hit the switch
That keeps you from getting gone

Oh Nouel, it must hurt like hell
When you're so afraid to die
Semper femina
So am I

She lays herself across the bed
The origine du monde
Slight of shoulder, long and legged
Her hair a faded blonde

Oh Nouel, you sit so well
A thousand artists' muse
You'll be anything you choose
Fickle, unchangeable are you
And long may that continue

I do well to serve Nouel
My only guiding star
Fickle, unchangeable
Semper femina

// Nothing, Not Nearly //

I won't forget the late September
Where we danced among the midnight embers
But it's going like a half-remembered dream
Left and north of where we met
Thinking better of going west
Yeah we lost each other in a river stream
I thought I'd come and find you there
Wait until you lost your hair
And got your place out in the woods
You're not afraid of trees or bears
Or anything with tendencies
To wanna hurt you good

The only thing I learnt in a year
Where I didn't smile once, not really
Nothing matters more than love, no
Nothing, no, not nothing no, not nearly

We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone it's gone

I won't forget the late September
Where we danced among the midnight embers
But it's going like a half-remembered dream
Left and north of where we met
Thinking better of going west
Yeah we lost each other in a river stream

The only thing I learnt in a year
Where I didn't smile once, not really
Nothing matters more than love, no
Nothing, no, not, nothing no, not nearly

We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone it's gone
Love waits for no one

We've not got long, you know
To bask in the afterglow
Once it's gone it's gone
Love waits for no one
