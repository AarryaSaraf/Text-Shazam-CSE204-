// The Muse //

God's work is planned
I stand here with a man that talked to me so candidly
More than I choose.

My lips once rouged
I feel again the blues of longing, ever longing, to be confused

He wrote me a letter
Saying he would love me better
When my poor sons begetter the rules

Spoke of love like hunger
He at once was younger, younger, ever younger, in my hunger for a muse

Finest man that I've seen ever since my eyes have been
But his honesty did gleam me blind

Keep those thoughts from sight
Follow me into the night
And you can call on me when you need the light

You know what I need
Why won't you giveth me?
Must I fall down at your feet and plead?

Don't you be scared of me
I'm nothing but the beast
And I'll call on you when I need to feast

// I Was Just A Card //

I was just a card, caught up in the stars,
Looking down to Mars.
You know, you know
I know, I know something
About you that you don't want me to know.

Never found a solid hand till I found that man,
Till I found that man of mine.
You were looking at me, thinking,
"Who am I?"

Never knew the sky was white till I took that flight,
Till I took that flight to him,
Tonight.

I was just a card, caught up in the stars,
Looking down to Mars.
You know, you know
He knows, he knows something
About me that I don't want him to know.

Could've sworn I had that man when he took my hand,
When he took my hand down near you.
You were looking at me, thinking,
"Who is she?"

I didn't even see the night till I said goodbye,
Till I said goodbye to him,
Tonight.

// Don't Ask Me Why //

I choose to stay far away
From the ones that think
Money is money to share
Don't ask me why
And I'll tell you no lies

Sonny don't come here no more
He don't drink from this well
O he's done with the world
And done with the girl
And I don't ask him why
And he tells me no lies

Those of us who are lost and low
I know how you feel
I know it's not right but it's real
But it's real.

I don't ask for love
And I don't beg for money
I'm just asking for grace and forgiveness
Now honey don't ask me why
And I'll tell you no lies.

Been looking for answers
In unsavoury places
On the highest of mountains
And on the lowest of bases
And I still don't know why
I still don't know why.

Those of us who are lost and low
We know how you feel
We know it's not right but it's real
But it's real.

I took the wind from the sea
I took the blood from an arrow
I took the wisdom of spring
And I was thrown and blown and tossed and turned until
Time found its hand and called an end
Me and time we go way back when
I was a child
And I always knew why.

I knew my name
I knew my road
And I stayed away from heavy loads
I'm still, I'm low
O lord am I low

Those of us who are lost and low
We know how you feel
We know it's not right but it's real
But it's real.

// Salinas //

I am from Salinas
Where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother was a saviour
Of six foot of bad behaviour
Long blonde curly hair down to her thigh
Oh my mother
Oh my friends
Ask the angels
Will I ever see heaven again?

Late into the evening
They would take each other screaming
Looking darkly to the back of her eyes
A careless beast was bleating
That the air behind was breathing
That they mustn't ever look up to the sky
There no answers
There are found
Ask the angels
Am I heaven bound?

Mmmm put it down to me
I, who speak awkwardly
Any word if it is heard is not intended to be
Not for him and not for her
And not for them and not for me
Oh and that gun will turn
Before the sun starts to burn
Understand

Mmmm when the clouds roll in
We start to pay for our sins
With a gun in my hand
And my son at my shoulder
Believe I will run
Before that boy gets older
Oh when that gun will turn
Befor the sun starts to burn
Understand
Oh when that gun will turn
Befor the sun starts to burn
Understand

I am from Salinas
Where the women go forever
And they never ever stop to ask why
My mother she is a saviour
Of six foot of bad behaviour
With long dark curly hair down to her thigh
Oh my mother
Oh my friends
Ask the angels
Will I ever see heaven again?
Will I ever see heaven again?
Will I ever see heaven again?

Punish them all for they speak too much
Hate the world for what it did to us
Will I ever see heaven again?

// The Beast //

Where did our love go
You will never know
How did you get home
You will never know

Did you catch yourself in the mirror?
It's a sight I understand
You considered it all for a second
And put it down to slight of hand

You know I've been running 'round for hours
Calling my egyptian blood to bear me flowers
Calling sophia, goddess of power

Instead I got the beast
And tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes to beast

You're okay now, I suppose
You're not pulled by the rope
I'm pulled by the pull on my throat
I'm pulled by the rope
I swing from the trees into the slope
Hold my head high, just by the tip of my toes
And he lies, he lies so sweet that I choke

Tonight I choose the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes the beast

Put your eyes away 
If you can't bear to see your old lady laying
Down next to the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes the beast

Look at yourself in the mirror
It's a sight I understand
You consider it all for a second
And put it down to slight of hand
I give you the best, the best that I can

I suggest that you be grateful
That it's your blood on my hands
And assume yourself weaker, the fall of man
And look out for the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes the beast

Put your eyes away
If you can't bear to see your old lady laying 
Down next to the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
And here comes the beast

// Night After Night //

Darling, I loved you,
I long to become you
And know what it is that you gave

We dance the sorrow
Forgive me tomorrow
I pray 

Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken
My mind drift away?

Dear lover forsaken
Our love is taken away
You were my speaker
My innocence keeper
I don't 

Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken,
My mind drift away?

Dear lover forgiven
My love is driven by rage
Oh I should just leave you
Instead I've deceived you
But I don't 

Night after night, day after day
Would you watch my body weaken 
My mind drift away?

I count no one, hold nobody's ear
I sold you my hand once and you hit me in fear
I don't stand for the devil
I don't whisper in ears
I stand on the mountains and call people to hear

It's a sudden burst of light
It's a fate foretold 
It is knowing, it is knowing

He longs for the answers, as all of us must
He longs for the woman who will conquer his lust
He screams in the night, I scream in the day
We weep in the evening and lie naked and pray

Night after night, day after day
Night after night, day after day
Could you watch my body weaken
And my mind drift away?

It's a tempting communion
It's a fate foretold
It is knowing, it is knowing
What it is that you're told

// My Friends //

My friends, my dear friends
And lovers, oh my lovers
I'd leave you for them
They got a hand on my back

Mama has money now and Mama has friends
She's making rags for some uptown hags
With their money in bags
And why are you so sad?

Why are you always so sad?
Why do I not understand?
Why don't I see what it is you see?
Why can I live and just be?

I'm full of guilt
I am full of guilt
You're very tall, you're very handsome
You have it all, your skin smells like man

And I, you never know how I ache
You will never know how I ache
Don't touch that in grace

Ever considered the sea?
I heard you had to be strong
Why not float around with me?
It won't take you so long

You can go where I'm at
You can hang around with me
And a few good men will go where they all
Where they all not be
And a few good mothers go for what they,
What they all not teach

And I long for a touch or reminder of us but,
But it must not be

And a few strong branches over water reach for what they all not reach

I hope your mother knows where it is you have been
I hope your mother knows what it is you have seen
She'd be so proud
She will never know how I ache

// Rest In The Bed //

There lies a man of my heart
A fine and complete work of art
Here I his woman
His home and his heart
And proud to be playing that part
And proud to be playing that part

Rest in the bed of my bones
All that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall live.

The sirens come
Feel your call as a sound as I
Believe in you

The first deal's the hardest I'm sure
Where our shadows come to the shore
Know that it's you and I till the end
And all I want from life is to
Hold your hand

All that I have are these bones
And all that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall live.

The sirens come
They always will
But the dart between my heart and his
Is as good as a diamond chain

Rest in the bed of my bones
All that I want is a home
And all you can do
Is promise me bold
That you won't let me grow dark
Or cold
As long as we both shall live.

// Sophia //

Oh I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Shy and tired eyed am I today

I'm wounded by dust
All I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Tried and tired eyed am I today

Sometimes I sit, sometimes I stare
Sometimes they look and sometimes I don't care
Rarely I weep, sometimes I must
I'm wounded by dust

When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day,
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman that is going to place claim but you said that it was coming on judgement day

Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust

When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day,
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman that is going to place claim but you said that it was coming on judgement day

Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust
Now Sophia

// All My Rage //

Stole my children, left my son
Of all of them, he's the only one who did not mean that much to me
I tip my cap to the raging sea

Oh cover me up, I'm pale as night
With a mind so dark and skin so white
Is this the devil having fun?
I'd tip my cap to the raging sun

Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun

Stole my children, left my son
Of all of them, he's the only one who did not mean that much to me
I tip my cap to the raging sea

My daughter, she's the pretty one
I married her off to the reverend's son
Now she lives in a sin-free world
Tip your cap to the brave old girl

Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun

Now all my rage been gone
Now all my rage been gone
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun
I'd leave my rage to the sea and the sun

// Flicker And Fail //

He took a bus to meet me in a bar in a Tuscan hill
Oh a sight I'd never seen, I believe in God still
But you wouldn't be able to stop me if I feel like running away
Wouldn't be able to stop me if I didn't want to stay

And the rain fell on the houses
And on the late swaying trees
It fell its fiercest on the skulls of the willingly deceived
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God

Said he'd been sleeping lonely, spending nights under the stars
Little darling, we're all lonely, we don't all show our scars
It's my heart, and my burden, and I would never bring you down like that
My heart, my burden, I would never bring you down with me

And the rain fell on the towers and on the late swaying trees
And it hammered and it raged on us unwillingly
And the believers were forewarned, and they ran into the storm
And watched the earth's light flicker and fail
Watched the earth's light flicker and fail
Flicker and, flicker and fail

They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God
