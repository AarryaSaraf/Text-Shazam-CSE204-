Album: Changes

// All Around Me //

Not sure what I was doin' before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the take down
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feeling I can't ignore

I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home, to the road, I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable, our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah

Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feeling I can't ignore

I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home, to the road, I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable, our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Habitual //

Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual, yeah

Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

Just to think that we've been out here this whole time
Workin' through the seasons
Never crossed paths 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (So habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah (No)
Never ungrateful for it (Never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it (Oh)
Habitual (Ooh, ooh)
Can't nobody keep me like you (Oh, keep me like you)
Call it unconventional (Call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (Our love is habitual, oh)

Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

// Come Around Me //

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me even though you been with me

Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got influence on me, can't comprehend
Oh no, next thing you're on top of me
Ok with this I call that a win-win

So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me even though you been with me

Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively

Who taught you how to drive stick?
You a fool with it
Love the way you fool with it
And the way you motion
Motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it

So when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me even though you been with me

Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Pull me down aggressively

When I rise up
Baby don't shy up
Open your mind
Don't knock it 'til you try it, darling
Show off
When you come closer
Don't waste no time
I love it when I'm in it, shawty

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me even though you been with me

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me even though you been with me

(So when you come around me)
(Do me like you miss me)

// Available //

Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always 'bout me
Don't make any sense in you bein' lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available

Nothin' like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they're off me and let it sink in
Hear me talkin', don't ignore me
I was just about to call it, what you thinkin'?
Been thinkin' 'bout you, can't get this vision out my head
Got a grip, I'm holdin' onto every thing you say
Ain't makin' this up just to get you in my bed
If you ain't left, yeah, you can go ahead

Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always 'bout me
Don't make any sense in you bein' lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

I get frustrated when you're busy
Lately, that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feelin' less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, trippin' in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

Are you available (Yeah-yeah) now?
Oh, here I am, (Yeah-yeah) oh, here I am
Are you available? (Yeah-yeah)
Just tell me, "Yeah"
'Cause for you, I am
You know I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
Are you available (Yeah-yeah)
Like I'm available?

Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

// Running Over //

[Justin Bieber:]
From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

[Lil Dicky:]
LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up? (Breast)
How you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just

[Justin Bieber:]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

// Take It Out On Me //

Kid
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me

Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh

You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me

Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that

You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might (Hey)
And get it all out 'til you feel light (Ooh-oh)
And take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)
You can take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)

// Second Emotion //

[Justin Bieber:]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seen ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up? I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't

Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

[Justin Bieber (Travis Scott):]
Got me feeling giddy (Ah), like, "La, la, la, la" (Yeah)
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la" (It's lit)
You got the keys to my city (Ooh), like, "La, la, la, la" (Straight up)
Do you second that emotion, baby? (Ah, yeah)

[Travis Scott:]
Mmm, yeah
Out to big boys (It's lit)
Spring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit
Movin' like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)
So you know there's room (Skrrt)
So, baby, please
(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)
Don't like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?

[Justin Bieber:]
Did I come 'cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
It's just a part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby

Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it (Ooh-wee)
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head (Hey, hey, hey)
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it (Ooh-wee)
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)

Got me feeling giddy, like, "La, la, la, la"
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la"
You got the keys to my city, like, "La, la, la, la"
Do you second that emotion, baby?

// Get Me //

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Kehlani:]
Ooh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny this energy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no

[Kehlani & Justin Bieber, {Kehlani} *Justin Bieber*:]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me (Yeah, you really get me, {ooh})
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me *Ooh, that's where you send me*
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me *Ooh, you really get me*

[Kehlani & Justin Bieber (Justin Bieber):]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Ooh)
Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Oh, oh)

[Kehlani:]
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah

// E.T.A. //

Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago

I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been?"
Love me like you don't want it to end

I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be

// Changes //

Some days I move like water
Some days I burn like fire
Some days I wanna push further
Some days I wanna do nothin'

And I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes we might disagree
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

Sometimes I'll go to sleep early
Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

I be goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change
Yeah, I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes (Ooh, yes I am)
Though I'm goin' through changes (That's right)
Don't mean that I'll change, woah

La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum
La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum, no
La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum
I'm going through changes
No, I ain't changed, yeah
Uh, people change, circumstances change
But God always remains the same

// Confirmation //

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now (One more time)

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud

Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Look at how it's all unfolding
Yeah, persistence at its finest
Like you wanted in before the door was open
Instead of lettin' what's scripted play out

Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

And we've got the rest (Hey, hey)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest (Oh-ooh)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
Yeah, we've got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

// That's What Love Is //

Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side

Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time

I reach out to you
But my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide

Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life

Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense, to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now, I know what love is

I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low, you lift it right up through the ceiling
Ooh-whoa

Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
No

(Ahh-ah-ahh)
(Ahh-ah-ahh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what love is
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la-la-la-la)

I appreciate you (Ahh-ah-ahh)
God bless your maker, hey (Ahh-ah-ahh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what love is
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what love is
(La-la-la-la-la-la) Look at this love

// At Least For Now //

I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

Right leg crossed while you're smoking a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody taking pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watching you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
At least for now, at least for now, oh

Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done

Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

You already know I got it
Can't keep flexin' on you when you can't stop this
You already know you want this
If you talkin', then you ain't doin' nothin'
Oh, when your hands on my body
In the AM or PM, you'll get what you're needin' from me
Sugar, honey, so sweet
