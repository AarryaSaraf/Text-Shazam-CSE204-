Album: ATributeToTheBestDamnFiddlePlayerInTheWorldOrMySaluteToBobWills

// Brown Skinned Gal //

About the time the late and great Jimmie Rodgers career came to an end
Another young fella by the name of Bob Wills
Was makin' preparations to become a legend in his own time
Somewhere round about 1934
He formed the group called the Texas Playboys
With the help of these original musicians
On this album we're gonna turn back the pages of time
And recapture some of the great sounds of legendary Bob Wills and his
Texas Playboys

// Right Or Wrong //

Right or wrong I'll always love you
Though your're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret.

All along I knew I'd lose you
Though I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you.

All along I knew I'd lose you
Though I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you...

// Brain Cloudy Blues //

My brain is cloudy my soul is upside down
Lord my brain is cloudy my soul is upside down
When I get the slow down feelin' I know the blues must be someplace around
Well you gotta treat me right honey day by day.

Get out your little prayer book get upon your knees and pray
You're gonna need you're gonna need my love someday
And you're goin' to be sorry oh you treated me this way.

Well good evenin' don't that sun look good goin' down
I said well good evenin' don't that sun look good goin' down
And don't your home look lonesome when your lover ain't no place around
Well I tried everything baby to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna stop my cryin' and leave you alone
You don't believe I need it you can't count the tears I'm gone
Cause you're gonna need you're gonna need my love someday
And Lord you're goin' to be sorry oh you treated me this way...

// Stay A Little Longer //

[Spoken:]
Biffy on the drums and Dennis, you on the bass
When I count this off, ya'll give me a little Texas
Playboy type rhythm, okay
One, two, three four.

[Spoken]
Gather round friends, why hurry
Let's all stay a little longer.

[Sang:]
You oughta see my blue eyed Sally
She live way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate, the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store.

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why ya don't stay a little longer.

[Spoken:]
Georgie French on the piano
Good mornin' Joe

Can't go home if you're goin' by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
The big creek's up and the little creek's level
I plow my corn with a doubled shovel.

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why ya don't stay a little longer.

[Spoken:]
That's Tiny Roy
Hey

Sittin, in the window singin' to my love
Slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and grasshopper eatin' ice cream
The mule got sick so they laid him on the green.

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why ya don't stay a little longer.

Grab your gal and pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits feed her corn bread
girls on cripple creek, bout half grown
They jump on a man like a dog on a bone.

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why ya don't stay a little longer.

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
Don't see why ya don't stay a little longer...

// Misery //

(Johnny take your banjo there I'm gonna try to do Tommy Duncan's part
And Eldon and Tiny and Roy you can make a whole thing called Misery
Two three four.)

Went to bed last night wasn't sleeping
Wondering what's happening to me
You took my heart and left me lonely
Now I've got nothing left but misery.

Wondering if you have found another
Love brings no consolation to my heart
Some of these days you'll be sorry
That you fill my heart with misery.

Some of these days you'll be sorry
That you fill my heart with misery misery...

// San Antonio Rose //

Deep within my heart lies
A melody, a song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I lived with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon and all your splendor know
Only my heart call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals
Falling apart speak once again of my love my own

Oh, broken song empty words
I know still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone

// I Knew The Moment I Lost You //

A man may have his trials and tribulations
And at times he feels so low and so blue
But from now on I will be entirely different
And I knew the moment I lost you.

Well to all my worries and my disappointments
There is still a little light shining through
Still within my heart I know there is another
And I knew the moment I lost you.

There is nothing we can do to get along
Now that's been proved unto me and to you
So why not let's be fair to each other
For I knew the moment I lost you.

If there's something I have done you've not forgiven
Just remember that I'm human same as you
Why not let's consider our mistakes dear
For I knew the moment I lost you...

// Roly Poly //

Hey Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly knowin' all the biscuits
Long as he can chew it it's okay.

He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes everything from a soup to hay
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
And he's gonna be a man someday.

Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast bread
And jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly eats a hard day dinner
It takes lots of strenght to run and play.

Bowls up weeds and does the chores
Run both ways to Holday's stores
He wears up that apetite that way
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
But he's gonna be a man someday...

// Old Fashioned Love //

Got that old fashioned love in my heart
And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same.

Got that old fashioned fate in my heart
And nothing can tear us apart
Dry land may turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
Got that old fashioned love in my heart.

Got that old fashioned love in my heart
And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same...

// Corrine, Corrina //

I love Corrina tell the world I do
I love Corrina tell the world I do
Just a little more lovin' makes your heart beat true.

Corrine Corrina where you've been so long
Corrine Corrina where you've been so long
Ain't had no lovin' since you been gone.

Corrine Corrina where you stayed last night
Corrine Corrina where you stayed last night
Came home this morning sun was shinin' bright.

Goodbye Corrina this is fare thee well
Goodbye Corrina this is fare thee well
When I get back babe Lord you never can tell...

// Take Me Back To Tulsa //

Where's that gal with red dress on
Some folks called her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Little bee sucks the blossom
Big bee makes the honey
Poor man raise the cotton
Rich man makes the money.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

We always wear a great big smile
We never do look sour
Travel all over the country
Playing by the hour.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry...
