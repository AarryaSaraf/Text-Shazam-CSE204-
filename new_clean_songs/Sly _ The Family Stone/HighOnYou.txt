// I Get High On You //

When push comes to a shoving
I'd rather make some lovin'
And without being sneaky
Or sounding to you freaky
I get high

To know you is my pleasure
And you're my only treasure

Your body seems to creep in
And slowly you awake me
Wow Mother Nature takes me

You know what I've been doing
I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
Naturally I get high yes on you
I get high on you

// Le Lo Li //

Different pills for different thrills
Different days for different ways
Different freaks for different weeks
If you just spent your last dollar
And it didn't make cents or sense
If you just wanted to follow
And you're running out of presidents
Sing it
Le lo le lo le lo li le
Le lo le lo le lo li lo

When nighttime finds you wishing
'Cause daylight has to bring
The one thing that could be missing
Is a melody to sing
Sing it
Le lo le lo le lo li le
Le lo le lo le lo li lo

Shakabra
Shakadida
Means right on brother and right on sister
Anyway I learned it in Hawaii
Now it's time to do some wailing
Come on and dance with me
Nothing is to gain in failing
So come on and dance with me
Sing it
Le lo le lo le lo li le le lo

Feels pretty good to hum sometime
If you just wanted to follow
You're running out of breath again
Le lo le lo
Le lo le lo
Le lo le lo
Le lo le lo
Le lo le lo
Le lo le lo

// My World //

My world
My wish upon a star
Is never ever far
My world
A feeling deep inside
My magic carpet ride
My world
The one thing I defend

She's my friend and best of kin
My world
My troubles disappear
Anytime she's near
My world

My world
The answer to my prayer
More reason why I care
My world
The joy in all my fun
A woman and a girl in one
My world

The reason for my smile
The mother of my child
So much I have to give
The life I have to live
The reason for my smile
The mother of my child
So much I have to give
The life I have to live

// So Good To Me //

You're good to me
Because you're people
You're good to me
Because you're people
So you see me and we party
And you know I party hearty
Should I offer a joint to you
You can say yes or no
Let me offer a point to you
You can slam my front door

I love you anyway
Cause you can be yourself today
You're good to me
Because you're people
Don't you feel a little stronger
Little more real a little more longer
Should I offer a drink to you
Just because your throat is dry
Let me offer a point to you
You should not wonder why

I love you anyway
You can be yourself today
You're good for me
I know it
I can't blow it
You're good to me
All you people in general
You're good to me
Because you're people
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
