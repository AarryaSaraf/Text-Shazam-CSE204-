Album: BackOnTheRightTrack

// Remember Who You Are //

When we know we are hearing
Everything we say
What they think they're feeling
Are the games they think we play
And if you're like nobody
Remember you're nobody else, too
Know you tried too hard to get along
Then you're only bein' yourself

Remember who you are
Remember, that's who you will be
Remember who you are
Remember, that's the person
Who's gonna be free

When things seem so hazy
And facts attempt to blind
The few that think it's crazy
Confused with peace of mind
They must know you're hearing
Everything they say
Giving you more of a reason
To keep on goin' your way

Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are

Flirtin' with what you shouldn't
Very little chance to grow
Hurtin' when you know you wouldn't
No win, no place, no show
Somebody else's medicine
Could be a poison to you
But you can always bet it some
'Cause when yon play yon play

Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are

// Back On The Right Track //

Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

I know the feelin' of bein' without
When deep within you're deep without
Only way to clear the doubt
Is turnin' all your insides out

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track

Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

Sometimes... that has caused so much
Is really not at all to touch
If what I see is right in front of me
There's no reason to need a crutch

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track
[x2]

Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

Ain't it sweet when finding out
That deep within you're not without
When nothingness had...
I'm just turnin' my insides out

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track

Time in for gettin' back [Repeat and fade]

// If It's Not Addin' Up... //

When it's not addin' up
Baby, you should multiply
Everything that they subtract
If they know something we should try

Choosin' ways we're livin' in
It gives so many reasons to play
If your vision starts givin' in
When you need it most to stay
Looks like it's not addin' up
Looks like it's not addin' up
Seems it's not addin' up
Looks like it's not addin' up

Although Mom she raised no fool
Like all guys I'm tryin' to blame
Little no no's tryin' to be cool
And she's the one that gave me my name
If it's not addin' up
If it's not addin' up
Seems it's not addin' up, y'all
Seems it's not addin' up

ABC to XYZ
What a pretty alphabet
When you're finding out and you see
It has stopped and where it is yet
If it's not adding up
It seems it's not adding up
If it's not addin' up
If it's not addin' up

Don't you think like it's not addin' up

// The Same Thing (Makes You Laugh, Makes You Cry) //

The same thing that makes you laugh
Could make you cry
And the same food you eat to live
Can make you die
The same truth you thought you heard
Could be a lie
That's why the same thing that can make you laugh
Can make you cry

Same thing that'll make you laugh
Will make you cry
Same thing that'll make you laugh
Will make you cry

The same thing that makes you laugh
Will make you cry
The same food you eat to live
Can make you die
The same truth you thought you heard
Could be a lie, check it out
The same thing that will make you laugh
Will make you cry

The same thing
Yes the same old thing that make you laugh
Can make you cry
The same thing that make you laugh
Can make you cry
The same thing that makes you laugh
Can make you cry
The same food you eat to live,
Could make you die well
The same truth you thought you heard
Could be a lie, check it
The same thing that makes you laugh
Will make you cry

The same thing that make you laugh
Will make you cry
The same thing that make you laugh
Will make you cry ......

// Shine It On //

Bo bo bo bo bo when you want to
Shine it on

They may not like the way you walk
They may not listen when you talk
But... will understand
If what you're doin'
If what you're doin' is all you can

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

Sometimes the pressure could feel like tons
But keep on stickin', stickin' to your guns
When you're tryin' to do your best
Don't you worry, worry, worry about the mess

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on

One ounce of label is all they need
And a pound of care you give indeed
But when they notice only one gram
You can assume they don't give a damn

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
[x4]

Sometimes the pressure could feel like tons
But keep on stickin' to your guns
When you're tryin', when you're tryin'
To do your best
Don't you worry about the mess
Shine it on

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
