// Underdog //

Hey dig!
I know how it feels to expect to get a fair shake
But they won't let you forget
That you're the underdog and you've got to be twice as good (yeah yeah)

Even if you're never right
They get uptight when you get too bright
Or you might start thinking too much, yeah (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels when you know you're real
But every other time
You get up and get a raw deal, yeah (yeah yeah)

Say I'm the underdog
I say I'm the underdog
Say I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog

I know how it feels to get demoted
When it comes time you got promoted
But you might be movin' up too fast, yeah (yeah yeah)

If you ever love somebody of a different set
I bet the set didn't let you forget
That it just don't go like that (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels 
For people to stop, turn around and stare
Say goodbye and they low rate, low rate me (yeah yeah)

I don't mind I'm the underdog
No I can handle it I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog, yeah
Underdog

I know how it feels to be played upon
See you at the party
But you're really, you're really all alone (yeah yeah)
They just underestimate me

I know how it feels when you're feelin' down
And you wanna come up but you realize
You're in the wrong part of town, yeah (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels to have to go along 
With people you don't even know
Simply because there happens to be 
A whole lot more of them, yeah (yeah yeah)

Say I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog
I don't mind 'cause I can handle it
Underdog, It's gonna be alright
I'm the underdog

// If This Room Could Talk //

I've made a mistake in this room
I did something I had to do
I wish that I was dreamin'
So, I could wake up and, wooo...
Wake up and love you, oh yeah

I'm sorry but you pushed me too hard
You walked all over me
It seemed like you were jesting
To see if I could be

If this room could talk
You would know that I love you
I need you
I want you, and furthermore
I got to have you
I got to have you, oh yeah
I got to have you, oh yeah
I got to have you, yeah

I know you don't expect me to call you
If this room won't give me a hand
I would rather be without you
Cause I would be less than a wooo
Less than a man, ooh yeah
Less than a man

If this room could talk
You would know that I love you
I need you
I want you, and furthermore
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to, ooh yeah

// Run, Run, Run //

Run, run, run, they don't like what we're thinking
At least we are not staggering from drinking

Say, dig!
Don't try to figure out 
What's happenin' inside their head
Ain't too much goin' on 
Inside the head of the dead

Run, run, run, to avoid the hasslin'
When he bugs you, you know his mind is wrestlin'

Say, dig! 
What?
The groovy music, inside my head is soakin'
And the... to tell me what I should be smokin'

Bop-bop...

People, listen!
People, listen!
People, listen!

People, people

Run, run, run, they don't like what we're wearin'
The colors we like, they're doin' a lot of starin'

Say, dig! 
What?
Things we do upset their flesh and blood and bone
But I got an idea!
Maybe what they oughta do is leave their flesh and blood and bone at home

// Turn Me Loose //

Loose, two, three, four

Turn me loose, you got my mind
You got my body, you got my soul
Turn me loose, I'm incomplete
She got my heart, I'm out of control

You tell me to leave I like you
If you tell me stay I hate you
Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose

Turn me loose, I'm feelin' down
I'm on the ground, you turn me around
Turn me loose, hey, I feel so bad
I'm going to say, I feel this way

You tell me to leave I'll thank you
If you tell me stay I hate you
Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose

Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose, I don't like to groove
Turn me loose, you hangin' my mind up
Turn me loose, I don't believe you

You tell me to leave I'll thank you, sir
If you let me stay I'll hate you

Turn me loose, keep on
Turn me loose
Turn me loose

// Let Me Hear It From You //

If you talked about me
Behind my back
Let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

And if another man has hold of you
Woman, because of something I lack
Let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

It's bad if you fell me
But it's not so bad if you tell me
So if you do anything I wouldn't want you to do, girl
Let me hear it from you, yeah
Let me hear it from you

If you have a love, love
For another man
Why don't you just tell me
And I know I can take it

And if, and if
You just don't think I can
Why don't you just write me a letter
And I know that I'll make it

I said, it's bad if you fell me, no no no
But it's not so bad if you tell me
So if you do anything I wouldn't want you to do now
I said, lord, let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

If you've done anything I wouldn't like
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me, what did you do last night?
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me

// Advice //

Take my advice if you want a lover
I'm not going to be your brother
Are you afraid of what you might want to do
Or is reality hard for you

You used to get yourself together
I've been treating you like bad weather
Scared your friends will get on you
You were too cautious when I warned you

One of these days you're gonna take off my shoes
You're gonna bring me the paper so I can read the news
I'm gonna love you so good
I'm gonna throw your mind
The fort of my love will got to dry your tide

Ain't nowhere for you to run
Your hope and wishes killed all your fun
Exhibition of what you don't know
Might be the reason for you to throw upon

Relax your mind and show your heart
I've never been your brother even from the start
I've always loved you, let me see your heart
Take down that wall to play your part

// I Cannot Make It //

I cannot make it!
I'm so hip!

If I make till tomorrow I'll be surprised
(I'll be surprised, I'll be surprised)
I am left with all the sorrow, look at my eyes, girl
(Look at my eyes, look at my eyes)

I been thinkin' I been fooled
There've been times when I've blown my cool
Said I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Don't be a fool today

The very next line will blow my mind, girl
(Will blow my mind, will blow my mind)
Yes, I love her but she's takin' all the time
(All the time, all the time)

I will not accept another
I would rather be her brother
Said I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Don't be a fool today

Wanna keep me
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
Cryin'
Wanna keep me (yeah yeah)
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
I wanna hear you say

If I cannot keep a watch on your daily news
(Your daily news, your daily news)
I might lose my head from havin' all these blues
(All these blues, all these blues)

I know then, that I shouldn't
Plus the fact I probably couldn't
Say I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Won't be a fool today

Wanna keep me
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
Cryin'
Wanna keep me (yeah yeah)
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)

I cannot make it!
I'm so hip!

// I Hate To Love Her //

It's about my heart
Kind of shaky inside
It's about my tears
I can't even hide

No, no, no

It's about my future
That I can't focus in
It's all about my past
And the times that I spent with her

I hate to love her
It's no fun
I would leave her
If I could

She doesn't love me
She can't even fake it
She won't respect me
If I stay I won't live another day
No, no, no

It's all about my baby
It's all about my
Why won't she be honest
And leave me behind to get over her

I hate to love her
I must hate myself
I hate to love her
It's bad for my health

// That Kind Of Person //

I met you
Then I wanted you
You shunned me
Then I haunted you

Now we're together but it's not the same as it was when I first met you
It's hard to believe that you could treat me this way
You just didn't seem like that kind of person at all

I love you when you shun me
I love you when you fun me

I thought, I thought you were much more human
It's hard to believe you could treat me this way
You just, you just didn't seem, seem like that kind of person at all

Let me tell you one thing, now, listen to this
I remember that you made me feel so good just to be near you
You've let me down so much, I fear you
My love you been wasted
You don't love me, I'll face it

It hurts when I think of how you treated me
It hurts when I think of how you cheated me
It's hard to believe you could treat me this way
You just did not seem like that kind of person at all

// Dog //

The purr of a tame house cat
The smile of a Miss Congenial
The worth of a poison rat
This at last

The nerve of you
The nerve of you
You treat me like a fool
Tryin' to make me blow my cool
You think you know it all
But you've got a lot to learn

Every dog, yeah, has his day now
Now I'm gonna see you get yours
You took the key to my heart
Now I'm gonna change the lock on the door

One dog, yeah, one day now
When it's over I'll be on my way singin'
Doggie, doggie, doggie, doggie
Singin' dog dog oooh dog

The sweetness of a flower
The love you put on me
The glow of a silver moon beam
The sting of a mad queen bee
You stung me

The nerve of you
The nerve of you
You treat me like a fool
Tryin' to make me blow my cool
You think you know it all
But you've got a lot to learn

Every dog, yeah, has his day now
Now I'm gonna see you get yours
You took the key to my heart
Now I'm gonna change the lock on the door

One dog, yeah, one day now
When it's over I'll be on my way singin'
Doggie, doggie, doggie, 
Singin' doggie doggie ooh
Dog dog oooh dog
Dog dog oooh dog
Dog dog oooh dog
