Album: WhenTheWindForgetsYourName

// Gonna Lose //

Don't you believe what you wanna see
Your mind keeps playing tricks on me
I wasn't sure 'cause you never know

Gonna lose your mind
Gonna lose your mind

What could be more disorienting
Than being on acid in a dream?
Thought I was done with that kind of fun

Gonna lose your mind
Gonna lose your mind

Now you know it's what you know
Yeah, you know it's what you know
Yeah, you know it's what you know

I've come to realize time's all wrong
Answers materialize then they're gone
They were here, but the ones like that
Disappear and they don't come back

Tell me again about this memory
Are you sure you didn't just see it on TV?
Do I need to tell you what you're gonna lose?

// Fool's Gold //

I'm gonna keep trying
Keep trying
I'm gonna keep trying

Well now it's been an hour since I woke up
With this song running through my head
And the feeling that it gave me has started to slip away
It was only a dream but it still felt good
To spend a little time thinking something mattered
And I want to tell you something I got nothing to say

I'm gonna keep trying
Keep trying
I got a chance
I'm gonna keep trying

Just a dream
Just 'cause I'm asleep
Just a dream no one else can see
Just a dream
Just a dream

I'm gonna keep trying
If I don't keep trying, I'm never gonna make it
I'm gonna keep trying

Fools gold made me rich for a little while
Rich for a little while, rich for a little while
Fools gold made me rich for a little while

Just a dream
Just a dream

Fools gold made me rich for a little while
Rich for a little while, rich for a little while
Fools gold made me rich for a little while

It don't matter what they say
I'm gonna break my heart someday
Don't matter what they say
I'm gonna break my heart someday
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)
Don't matter
(White noise let me sleep for a little while)

// Understood //

How can I hear, how can I see
When no one really knows how it's gonna be?
You read it in a book, you hope it isn't true
And the next thing you know, it's happening to you

It's been a long time since we took a trip
To the bottom of a canyon in a rocket ship
Nothing's resonating in my mind
So I'm doing my best to be unrefined

You can always choose, but you don't
And you could be amused, but you won't
There's no way to figure it out
Life's just understood

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know

The deaf hear, the blind see
Just different things than you and me
The deaf can hear, the blind can see
That's what I've been told and that's what I believe

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know

You can always choose, but you don't
And you could be amused, but you won't
There's no way to figure it out
Life's just understood

It's been a long way, since the start of it
And part of the problem is... you're such a part of it
Seems like whatever we do is null
Why can't we ever just be left alone?

The blind see, the deaf hear
Exactly what is not clear
The blind can see, the deaf can hear
Finding out what is my greatest fear

You wanna move around, you wanna stay still
You wanna have a life, but not too real
Don't know what it means, but I know what it's like
To be floating down the canyon in a rocket bike

But really I don't know
But really I don't know
Really I don't know

// Elements //

Swimming down the river white
Into the ocean blue
And in a cave beneath the ocean floor
You find another you

You feel the ground beneath your feet
Makes you feel so strong
But when the earth
Begins to quake
You know there's something wrong

You feel the breeze at your back
It makes you feel so bold
But when the wind forgets your name
The world can be so cold

Up in the stars
Up in the sky
Another world abounds
And I don't know just what it means
But I like the way it sounds

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

// Rocksteady //

I like waking up Saturday
'Cause I'm all forgetting all my troubles behind
And I don't wanna see no other way
I don't wanna have to mess with making up my mind
Geology genealogy
Arbitrarily eventually came up with me
Sometimes we're high, sometimes we're low
High low, high low, I guess that's just the way we go

I don't wanna be constantly taking these
Long hard looks at myself
This psychology's been inside of me
I don't know how to be anybody else
Nobody else save me
Nobody else save us all

And now my heart don't have time for that
It's too busy pumping blood
My heart don't have time for that
It's too busy pumping blood

I don't see how anyone does anything
How they even make it through their days
And god don't ever help anyone
He's too busy working in mysterious ways
Geometry trigonometry
I don't know what they mean...

I know none of that's
Gonna help with all this pain

// Spiderweb //

Started out right in the night
Had a few fights with my mind
I saw the future and I saw a ghost
I saw a creature you know, you know
Someone's gonna mess up your mind
That isn't hard to find
How you gonna take it in your soul
No one may ever know

Who's gonna waste all your time

I've had these feelings for a long time
Ever since I was a kid
I thought they go away by now
But now I see they never did
I learned a lot about the way things are
And what we're supposed to do
And why you're me and why I'm you

Who's gonna waste all your time

And if you wanna know a secret
You better want to take it to your grave
I know you'll wanna talk about it
But talking doesn't make it go away
It's a sticky situation
And that's why everyone gets stuck
Now you know and now you know it's gone
Now you feel it now you're feeling wrong
Maybe we'll get it maybe we'll get along
Now you know and now you know it's gone

And we'll be alright in this spiderweb of love
And we'll be alright in this spiderweb of love

// Never Alright //

It's never how you remember
It's never quite the truth
It's never enough to get there
It's never enough for you

It's never been what they said there
It's never been what they do
It's never enough to get there
It's never enough for you

It's never alright
It's never alright

Breaking your heart must break their hearts
Breaking their hearts must break your heart

I can never see
I can never see beyond this
Beyond this, I can never see
I could never see beyond this, beyond this

Where they are
They could never be honest
Where they are
They could never be honest

No one can ever help no one
Not get their heart broken
All of this longing makes all of these days seem so long

And every day, everyone tells you
Everything you oughta be
I know that you don't believe 'em
But you take 'em so seriously

It's never alright
It's never alright

// Alright //

We can make it alright
We can make it alright today
We can have a new life
We can start a whole 'nother way
We can take it all back
So we can say whatever we feel
We can make it alright
We can make it alright and real

Now you can see I've got nothing to hide
Isn't it strange we're still strangers inside

We can't do what we want so we do what we can
Fuck all those people who don't understand

And your eyes will never see
They mean everything to me
And I can't see you without them
And I'll see this to the end
You're better than a friend
Ah we'll never know

Why can't we just get along?
How can we get each other so wrong?
Back and forth till all meaning is gone
And I'll open up for you
But I'm not a parachute
And I can't keep you from falling
Take some chances on yourself
You belong to something else
Ah we'll never know

Life goes on and on year after year
Don't recommend it, but I'm glad I'm still here
Let's get up and get over this fear

// Comes A Day //

Comes a day no one gets away
Nothing stays forever
Comes a time when nothing comes to mind
Nothing's fine forever
Life is long when waking up feels wrong
Think of how it's gone forever
Comes a day we'll never be the same
Something's changed forever

There is no, no, no more time left
There is no, no, no more time left

Comes a day nothing will remain
Nothing stays forever
The blind can see all eternity
The deaf can hear forever
Comes a day nothing gets away
No one ever stays forever

We can never know that
We can never show that
We can never understand why
How can you be for this?
How can we ignore this?
How can we be so blind?

I am not a shirt
I am not a shoe
You don't have to ever put me on
And for the record
I am not a record
Don't put me on
Did you ever wander?
Did you ever wonder?
Did you ever understand why?

And you'll never know 'cause you'll never know what's real
We're all paralyzed with life
And when you realize you can realize what's real
Isn't there something we can bide besides our time?

Well we think we know a lot of stuff
But this knowledge is really rough
We can read and write just enough to lie about it
You say it's lonely at the top for you
With no one to share the view
Well it's lonely at the bottom too
It's just more crowded

And you'll never know 'cause you'll never know what's real
We're all paralyzed with life
And when you realize you can realize what's real
Isn't there something we can bide besides our time?

I never wanted to be so lame
It just ended up happening
The only reason I did anything was to be loved
And staying cool when things are bad
Takes more courage than I ever had
So easy to just get mad
And how can you still complain?
There's no reason to explain
What we all go through is not the same
