// Famine //

I wake up early one morning
Then I went down to Spanish Town
To look for a friend of mine who called seminaya
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Old Harbour to look for my brother John
To ask him how is life and things and things and things
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said the situation is getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Clarendon to look for my family
Into a little district called Treadlight
That's where I was born
And we started to have a little talk together together
About the situation
And this is what they said
They told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said this cost of living getting so high high high
Getting so high

// Feel Free //

Make you feel free
Make you feel free

Something hidden inside
That really should come outside
So let's talk about what's hidden inside
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
It will make you feel free

Someone is inside
But really wants to come outside
Just to talk about what's hidden inside
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
It will make you feel free

Something is on your mind
That's keeping you so confined
So let's talk about what's on your mind
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free, yeah
Free at last
Hear the children sing, yeah

Make you feel free, yeah, free
It will make you feel free

Something is on your mind
That's keeping you so confined
So let's talk about what's on your mind
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
Make you feel free
Free as a bird up in a tree
Free at last, free, free, free, at last, yeah

Sometimes you let me feel like I'm not real
I want to say I'm free at last
When I was out, you didn't take me in

When I was hungry, you gave me no food
Though I was thirsty, you gave me no water
Should feel free from all misery

// Get Up Stand Up //

Get Up, Stand Up
Get Up, Stand Up
I was going... to see my love
And I was going
Get ready, brother

Get ready, sister
I was going... to see my love
I was flowing
Get on board the train

For the evening train would be too late
Get on board the train
For the evening train will be too late
But I don't hear it

Where is the evening train?
Sitting in the brightened sun
Waiting for the day to come
Wishing for the night to come

That won't help
Sitting in the brightened sun
That won't help
Each the night and day will come

That won't help
Get up now
Get up, stand up now
Sitting inside a soul

Crying every day for more
Crying every day for more
That won't help
Crying every day for more
Fly a bird in the evening sun

Burning out of control
Burning out of control
That won't help
See'mon, see'mon...
Get Up, Stand Up

Time is going down now
My summer love is fading

// Rhythm Down Low //

Rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Rhythm down low

I wanna sleep in the night
But the music is too high
Turn off the bright lights
And everything is alright
I wanna get my rights
In the middle of the night

Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Rhythm down low

I want to concentrate
I won't hesitate
I wanna sing my song
Sing it, sing it all night long
Because we really don't play
And we really won't wait

Turn the lights down low
Turn the rhythm down low

Listen...
All my life I've been feeling this rhythm
It makes me feel alright
All night long it's the same thing, repeated
Again and again and again and again and again

Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low
Turn the rhythm down low, babe

I feel alright
Oh, and everything is alright
Turn the bright lights off
Let me come into my bed
I said the music's so high
Ohh, but the rhythm down low...

// My Love Is So Strong //

Every day you say
That you wish if I could go with you
Every night you keep on telling me
That you wish if I could follow you

Every time you keep on worrying, worrying me
That you wish if I could go with you

But it's a good thing I didn't follow you
Just to do those funny things you wanted me to do
Honey, you tried to, to bend my love, yeah
You made a fool of me

One time I know is not the same
When we used to play in the sun
We used to hold each other's hand
Remember we used to play in the pond

So all the good looks that you have
Would not break my heart
My old heart still remains the same
Honey, you tried to bend my love
And made a fool of me, yeah

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a look at my face
You will see that my future's still bright

Oh, bright as the sun in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine, yeah
Shine as the stars in the morning
The pattern in the sky, oh yeah

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a good look at my face
You will see that my future is still bright

Oh, bright as the stars in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine
Shine as the morning stars
That shine on the sky, yeah, yeah

Oh, that good thing have been for you
Oh, you do those funny things
Avoiding me for good

Oh, my love is so strong
