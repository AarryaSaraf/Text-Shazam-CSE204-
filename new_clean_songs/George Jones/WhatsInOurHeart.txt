// Flame In My Heart //

You cheated on me (you cheated me)
I tried to be fair (I tried to be fair)
But you don't believe enduring your share
But I've learned my lesson (I've learned my lesson)
And now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me like they used to do
Your arms only chill me I'm glad that we're through
My heart was once yearning (my heart was once yearning)
But now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fool me a while (you fool me a while)
You thought you were wise (you thought you were wise)
You even believed I fell for your life
But the trick's turned on you (the trick's turned on you)
Now gladly I say (now gladly I say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me...

// Let's Invite Them Over //

I know why you're lonely
And I know why you're blue
You're lonesome to see him
And you long to see her too

We're not in love with each other
We're in love with our best friends
So let's invite them over again

We've talked it over and over
And we know it's not right
We should stay away forever
But we're lonesome each night

Yes, we stay away for a while
But we know in the end
We'll invite them over again

We've talked it over and over
And we know it's not right
We should stay away forever
But we're lonesome each night

Yes, we stay away for a while
But we know in the end
We'll invite them over again
Let's invite them over again

// Suppose Tonight Would Be Our Last //

Suppose tonight would be our last night together
And the love we have known came to an end
Would we laugh and tell ourselves think nothing of it
Or would we cry together for what might have been
I know I'd die in just a little while without you
Another dawn I wouldn't want to see
If you're supposed tonight would be our last together
Oh what a long and lonely night it would be
I couldn't live long without your arms around me
Too soon the blues would come moving in on me
If you suppose tonight would be our last together
With you tonight would be the last night for me
I know I'd die in just a little while...

// I Let You Go //

I let you go when I needed you so
Not knowing then I want you back again
Now that you're gone there's one thing I know
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind
That you was within these arms of mine
It's too late now another's love you hold
I'll always regret I let you go
It hurts to know it was you I love so
Old mem'ry of you comes back to make me blue
One thought of you and tears begin to flow
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind...

// Multiply The Heartaches //

Once I thought two happy hearts would someday be as one
But then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
I count the many times I said I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by counting dreams that never will come true
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches

// She's My Mother //

I'm thinking of a little lady
She bears her load without a friend
The one who rocked me in my cradle
And through the years she loves me yet

The roses on her cheeks have faded
And when they pass her on the street
Would break my heart to see them mock her
Although she may not dress so neat

She was the first to ever love me
The first to hold me to her breast
God bless her 'cause she is my mother
And she'll be the last one I'll forget

Her way may seem a bit old fashioned
And some may laugh when passing by
I'm not ashamed to call her mother, my love for her I'll not deny
She was the first to ever love me

// What's In Our Hearts //

Everybody tells me you're a cheater
Yes and everybody says you cheated too
Should we believe them and let them tear our love apart
Or should we believe what's in our hearts

I believe in my heart the one I love is true
And I'd never take a chance on losing you
Side by side hand in hand we'll never be apart
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts

Only your two lips could make me happy
And I'm sure you know I feel the same way too
Together we will share a tender love no one can part
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts

I believe in my heart the one I love is true...

// Until Then //

I know I was a fool to let you go
I know it's true because my heart tells me it's so
My only chance at happiness is someday when
I'll win you back but I'll be blue until then
You mean the world to me my life my destiny
Your true love means everything to me
I try to lose the thought of loving you again
But memories are just a story with an end
For you the flame of love will burn till someday when
I'll win you back but I'll be blue until then
I try to lose the thought of loving you again...

// Don't Go //

As I sat at home with my troubles today
I was tempted to walk the wrong way
I remember the voice that once led me from sin
And I heard the same voice again
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back to the tavern and sin
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back and start drinking again
I could hear lots of laughter just over the way
My friends sounded happy and gay
I started to walk but my knees gave away
As I fell I heard the voice say
Don't go don't go don't go don't go just kneel by your bedside and pray
Don't go don't go don't go don't go God will answer your prayers today
God freed me from sin like he did once before
Now I'm happy as a man can be
God's voice sounded pleased as he spoke the next words
God must have seen a great change in me
Go on go on go on go on ask your friends there to kneel down and pray
Go on go on go on go on ask God will answer their prayers today

// Now Tell Me //

Have you ever come home tired and all worn out
Life is gay and you're wonderin' what it's about
Still you find out what is it mothers comin' for a visit
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever asked you hubby for some dough
With a dirty look he'll tell you where to go
Oh, you thought you had a thinker, but it turns out he's a stinker
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

We're not sorry we got married
Even though sometimes we fuss and fight
We're so happy we're together
Hope you know that everything will turn out right.

Have you ever called your wife and made a date
Just to have your honey show up three hours late
While across the floor you pace she's a-fixing up her face
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever spent the day a-scrubbin' floors. oh me
You've washed and ironed and done up all the chores
Well, your so tired your life is ruined then hubby asked what you've been doin'
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever set and worried about your debt
You wonder how you'll ever get 'em met
Then wife says she needs some cloths she's just got to have some dough
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

We're not sorry we got married
Even though sometimes we fuss and fight
We're so happy we're together
Hope you know that everything will turn out right.

Have you ever called up your honey for a date
Just to have your honey show up three hours late
While across the floor you pace she's fixing up her face
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?...

// There's A Friend In The Way //

We can explain this one too clearly cause he's known he's a friend
That's standing in the pathway of our love
Yes we love each other dearly but we just can't find the way
Night and day there's friend in the way
I told him once I loved him too and he thinks I'd never lie
To me he's been like my right hand he thinks I'm quite a guy
Yes we love each other dearly but we just can't find the way
Night and day there's friend in the way
I told him once I loved him too...
