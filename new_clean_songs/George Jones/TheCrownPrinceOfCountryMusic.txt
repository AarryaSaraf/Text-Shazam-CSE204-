// Maybe Little Baby //

Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
So everybody's thinkin' of somebody else
But nobody's thinkin' 'bout me

When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die
I bet, I'll have to go and hire me someone to cry
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's longin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's dreamin' 'bout somebody else
But nobody dreams about me

All I need is a bride who wants a big hearted groom
I wouldn't care if she came ridin' in on a broom
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's pinin' for somebody else
But nobody's pinin' for me
Everybody's crazy 'bout somebody else
But nobody's crazy bout me

Oh, I shine up my shoes and then, I slick down my hair
Put on my Sunday suit but I ain't goin' nowhere
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's yearnin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's fallin' for somebody else
But nobody's fallin' for me

Now, I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib
It looks to me like, I've been cheated out of my rib
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

// Run Boy //

Well, you and your true love have parted
And you left her all alone
Don't tell the kids until it's to late
Just say that the fault was your own.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry that you had to part
And don't break her heart in two.

She needs your love now more than ever
For she's all alone and blue
Don't fill her life with sorry and strife
Go Back and start over anew.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry you had to part
And don't break her heart in two.

Go back in that church, she'll forgive you
For doubting her love was true
Don't be ashamed to say your to blame
Her arms are still yearning for you.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry you had to part
And don't break her heart in two

// Heartbroken Me //

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you

// 'Ð¡ause I Love You //

I've had my problems with running 'round
But now I want to settle down
There nothing I won't do to be with you
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There nothing I won't do cause I love you

I did agree to set you free
On you I have no claim
But now I see you're for me
Won't you please take back my name
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There's nothing I won't do cause I love you

I did agree to set you free
On you I have no claim
But now I see you're for me
Won't you please take back my name
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There's nothing I won't do cause I love you

// You're In My Heart //

Please believe me when I say I can only feel one way
Every minute of the day you're in my heart
As I go down life's highway every night and every day
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart

Nothing dear could change my mind
You're in my heart to stay all the time
There will never in this world ever be a sweeter girl
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart

Nothing dear could change my mind
You're in my heart to stay all the time
There will never in this world ever be a sweeter girl
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart

// You All Goodnight //

The other day I met a girl while strolling through the park
And pretty soon this little girl was flirting with my heart
I'm so glad that I was there to find this lovely queen
The clock was striking romance right at two-fifteen
I kissed her once and held her tight and then I kissed her twice
She snuggled in my arms and said you kissed me oh, so nice
So far was I lost in a dream because she was my kind
Was then that I decided I would change her name to mine

At four-fifteen I bought the ring and bought the licence too
We stood before the preacher then and we both said I do
The preacher said my children I pronounce you man and wife
May your troubles all be small ones for the balance of your life

We found a furnished bungalow, the answer to our dreams
And we became the owners at exactly nine-fifteen
At ten-fifteen we locked the doors and turned out all the lights
And here my story ends my friend, I bid you all goodnight
And here my story ends my friend, I bid you all goodnight

Honey, is it morning yet? It ain't, well, goodnight...
