// Dixieland For Me //

I'm dreaming tonight of the mountains that's where I long to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day in my Dixie home sweet home
Old people here they just don't care I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
I'm going back to my old home in the mountains far away
Where the wild red roses smell so sweet and the rippling waters play
Old people here they just don't care...
This city life is not for me I'm going where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
Old people here they just don't care...
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me

// Once More //

Once more to be with you dear just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune if I could see you once more
Forget (forget) the past (the past) this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love (your love) I crave (I crave) I'll be I'll be your slave
If you'll just give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you dear...
Forget (forget) the past (the past)...

// I'd Jump The Mississippi //

I been lonely much too long I'd give a Yankee dime if you come back home
Honey won't you let me hold you tight
Tears keep a fallin' my eyes are blurred if I had the wings of a pretty little bird
I would fly right to your arms tonight
I'd jump the Mississippi deep and wide if you was a waitin' on the other side
Honey just to hug and hold you tight
I'd jump across and never get wet right there by your side I'd set
Yes indeed everything would be alright
If you would come back home to me make me happy like I used to be
I'd start and meet you halfway
I'd leave here and never look back I'd run a mile in a minute flat
To get to you before the end of day
I'd jump the Mississippi deep and wide...
I'd jump the Mississippi deep and wide...

// Please Be My Love //

I wanna be with you I can give you love that's true
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
No one could take you place with me don't ever think of setting me free
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love
No one can thrill me like you do I've spent the lifetime loving you
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
I think of you each day and night I just wanna hold you tight
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love
No one could take you place with me don't ever think of setting me free
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love please be my love

// I Dreamed My Baby Came Home //

I went to sleep last night lonely and blue
Tears were falling like the morning dew
But when I closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
And you were holding me kissing me like you used to do
My heart went crazy when you whispered I love you
Yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
Like you had never said goodbye to me
For just a little while my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
I went to sleep last night lonely and blue...
And you were holding me...
Yes you were standing there...

// Blue Moon Of Kentucky //

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on the moonlight night the stars were shining bright
It whispered from on high your love has said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said goodbye
I said the blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining...
Well it was on the moonlight night...
Well it was on the moonlight night...

// House Of Gold //

People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on the Judgement Day
That gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not pure and true?
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

// Wait A Little Longer, Please Jesus //

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many still wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

Here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
And their weary hearts are yearning for a rest
And they find they're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where they'll receive such peace and happiness

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many still wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

We look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes
And our weary hearts grow heavier with each day
We cry, oh Lord, please come
Come and take your children home
But then we look around us and we say

// I Can't Get Over You //

Oh well don't let the spinning ever stop you've got me spinning like a top
Going round and round is all I do
I can't tell the day from night I don't know the wrong from right
I only know I can't get over you
I've got an angel on one shoulder the devil on the other
I'm in between oh tell me what to do
One tells me let you go the other tells me no
I only know I can't get over you
You've got me spinning like a top don't let this spinning ever stop
Just tell me that your love for me is true
My heartaches disappear when you say I love you dear
I only know I can't get over you
I've got an angel on one shoulder...
I've got an angel on one shoulder...
I only know I can't get over you

// I'll Be There To Welcome You Home //

I remember my childhood my mother said son
Prepare to me Jesus when your work here is done
When I die just remember my soul will live on
I'll be there to meet you and welcome you home
I'll meet you in heaven some wonderful day
When the dark stormy clouds of life roll away
When your life here is over in this world of sin
I'll be there to meet you and welcome you in
When the cold hand of death comes and takes you away
Be ready to meet Jesus be ready today
Don't put it off as time passes on
Be ready to meet Jesus we'll welcome you home
I'll meet you in heaven...
