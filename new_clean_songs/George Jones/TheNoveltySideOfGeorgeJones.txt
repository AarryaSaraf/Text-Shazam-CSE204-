// White Lightning //

Well in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down
Then he'd fill up a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin my pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men revenoers too searchin for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin tryin' to book him but my pappy kept on cookin
(Whew white lightnin)

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
And my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Light has started flashin thunder started krashin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men...

Well a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I want to taste that powerful stuff
He took one slug and he drank it right down I heard him moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty mighty pleasin you'r pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men.

// Jambalaya (On The Bayou) //

Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh, my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou.

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file' gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Thibodeaux, Fontainbleau, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file' gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou...

// Revenooer Man //

Well, I was sent to a place in North Carolina
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my suprise
I could see a little light on the hill
Well, the fire was glowing and really I was knowing
I was really hot on the track
But in D.C. they said it couldnt' be
But I'll be the one to bring 'em back.

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Hey, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket
And a gun on my hip
And them moonshiners
Better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can.

Well the moon was shining bright
As I looked down the river
I noticed on the side of the hill
I can see a red light that was glowing bright
I knew it had to be a still
Well, the people down the road said it wasn't far
But I better know someone
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star
I'll bet my bottom dollar I'll have 'em on the run.

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket
And a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can.

Well when I got back the woods were bare
Must've knew I was on my way
Well, I heard the branches shatter
And they started to scatter
I heard two or three of them say
It's the revenooer man
It's revenooer man
He's got a big 45 and loads to fill
Dragging and shagging to another hill
It's the revenooer man
And he'll get us if he can.

Yeah, I'm the revenooer man
And I'll get 'em if I can...

// Slave Lover //

Well, I just get in my slippers and I light up my pipe
Sit down in my easy chair and fill the thing up right
I hear somebody holler and I jump to my feet
Go take out the garbage or you're gonna hear from me
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She'd tell me not to wait, don't you hesitate
Slave lover, that's what I am.

She sent me upstairs, downstair looking for her brother
Uptown, downtown looking for her mother
People think I'm buggy 'cause I'm lost like a lamb
Won't you tell me baby, who do you think I am
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover.
She treats me so unfair, she says that I'm a square
Slave lover, that's what I am.

Well, I go turn out the light and then I jump in bed
I got to get up early 'cause that's what she said
I go to church on Sunday and I hurry home fast
I just get through the door and she says take out the trash
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She tells me not to wait, don't you hesitate
Slave lover, that's what I am.

She sent me upstairs, downstair looking for her brother
Uptown, downtown looking for her mother
People think I'm buggy 'cause I'm lost like a lamb
Won't you tell me baby, who do you think I am
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She treats me so unfair, she says that I'm a square
Slave lover, that's what I am.

Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am...

// Too Much Water //

Well, I've been thinking about you all night long
What you been a doing to me
You told me that you love me, I thought that you loved me
But you never was true to me.

Well they say you're getting tired of all your running around
You're wanting me to settle dowm
It too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.

Well, there's things I've been wanting to tell you
There's a lot of things you need to know
And I don't think I'll wait for a later date
Now's the time to let you know.

'Cause there's been too many nights I've waited at your door
While you run around on me
But I got to thinking my ship started sinking
And I thought I'd better swim the sea.

So now my telephones ringing, pretty girls singing
So go ahead and run around
It's just too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.

Well, there's things I've been wanting to tell you
There's a lot of things you need to know
And I don't think I'll wait for a later date

While you run around on me
But I got to thinking my ship started sinking
And I thought I'd better swim the sea.

It's just too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.

// Battle Of Love //

(Battle of love)
For over a year I've been in love with a girl so sweet
But the guy next door has declared a war and I won't retreat
He hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
But I'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
We're just beginning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
He was once my friend through thick and thin but now I draw a line
For he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
But I know his plans so I'll take my stand and defend her
He's gonna find that I'm not the kind to surrender
I'm out for winning this mighty battle of love
(Battle of love)
Now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
I can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
I know I'm right and ready to fight for my true love
He's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
So I've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love
(Battle of love) 
Now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
And when they say I do I'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
If he wins her love how I ever learn to live without her
Cause here she is in my arms so why should I doubt her
If I'm really winning this mighty battle of love
I'm really winning this mighty battle of love

// Sparkling Brown Eyes //

There's a rambleshackle shack
Down in old Caroline
It keeps a callin' me back
To that gal of mine.

Yeah, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love.

Those two brown eyes
That sparkle with love
Shines down to me
From Heaven above.

Well, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love.

When the whippoorwills call
On the hill far away
We'll, you could sing a love song
It's gonna help me to say.

My love for you
Ain't gonna never, never die.
Yes, I'd rather sing a song
Everyday that I die.

// If I Don't Love You (Grits Ain't Groceries) //

Well, you got my heart a-feelin' used and junky
The road of love is gettin' mighty, mighty bumpy
Tell me pretty mama have I filled your heart with hate?

Well, with someone new you're affiliated
And it's makin' me feel like I'm outdated
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate

Well, let me know honey, tell me what's a-matter
Let me know what's on your mind
If I don't love you ain't a cow in Texas
They're raisin' 'em there all the time

Well, I don't want to sound like I'm demandin'
I just wanna get a little understanding
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate

Well, won't you tell me something, baby
Tell me what's a-matter
Let me know what's on your mind
If I don't love you ain't a cow in Texas
They're raisin' 'em there all the time

Well, I don't want to sound like I'm demandin'
I just wanna get a little understanding
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate

// Big Harlan Taylor //

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

I once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens
She outshined all others that I'd known by far
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor
Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan
I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'
She lost her desire to become my young wife

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan
Then I started wondrin' what good would it do
If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition
Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

If I figured them all out it would take many years...
