// It's Ok //

George Jones & Melba Montgomery
It's okay that you are leaving, it's okay if you don't care
It's okay that you are happy long as I don't interfere
It's okay with me sweet baby, I've been fed up from the start
It so fine to find another sucker, it's okay to break his heart
If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay , it's okay, it's okay

It's okay you found another, it's okay if he wants you
It's okay to leave tomorrow that just what I hope you do
It's okay if your a cheater, it's okay if cheaters win
Cause it's best to be a loser when your in the shape I'm in
If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay...

// Let Him Know //

Lost his love and started drinkin'
Trying Hard to stop from thinkin'
He found out it was not the thing to do
There no reason to be sobbin'
It won't stop your heart from throbbin'
Stop and think just why he left you there so blue.

If you see you were mistaken
Never a'gain you'll be forsaken
Can't you see he wants to do the thing that right
Let him know if your still greivin'
If you are he'll soon be leavin'
Let him know then he'll be right there tonight.

If you think he's gone forever
That's no reason while he'll never
Change his mind when your memeory starts to burn
Why don't you try to be stronger
Be with the one you love a little longer
Give him plenty of time to think it's now his turn.

If you see you were mistaken
Never again you'll be forsaken
Can't you see he wants to do the thing that right
There no reason to be sobbin'
It won't stop your heart from throbbin'
Let him know then he'll be right there tonight...

// Play It Cool //

Now if your baby's steppin' out
And makes you feel like a fool
Don't blow your top, don't rave and shout
Play it cool, man, play it cool

She'll run around and have her fun
She'll act like a kid in school
But she'll get tired and come back home
Play it cool, man, play it cool

She's really smart but she may act like a dunce upon a stool
Don't get the sweats, she'll come back yet
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now if you think she's flippin 'round
Like a fish that's out of its pool
Don't you fret or get all wet
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now if you think that your darlin'
She can use you like a tool
Just lock the door, and don't beg for more
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now she don't know just what it's like
To make a fool man drool
Don't lose your head and wish you were dead
Play it cool, man, play it cool

// Ragged But Right //

Well I've come here to tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a gambler I stay out late at night
But a porterhouse steak steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this old town can afford
Well I got big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy playin' rounds at my feet
I'm a rambler and a gambler and I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

Well then I got married I knew I'd settle down
And I built a little love nest right here in my hometown
Now I've got a family one that I'm proud of
I know that I'll be happy cause they're the ones I love
Well I got big electric fan...
I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

I'm a rambler and a gambler I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

// Yearning //

Yearning to be with the one I can't agree with
Yearning to hear you call my name
Like a fool I left you and now I can't forget you
Please forgive me take me back again.

I'll never be the same without you, darling
You'll always be my everything
My love for you's still burning and my poor heart is yearning
While you wear another's name.

Yearning to hold you, to let my arms enfold you
Yearning to hear you call my name
Yearning to kiss you, oh darling, How I'll miss you
Oh, how I wish you felt the same.

I never knew how much you cared about me
I thought that you were fooling me

Now I'm yearning to kiss you, oh how I'll miss you
I wish that we could make our romance restart

// Still Hurtin' //

I'll tell you the reason I sit here a-greivin'
I want you to know one by one
I've been defeated by someone who cheated
My heart out of all of it's fun
Happy we could be if you had stayed with me
But you wouldn't see it my way
But I'm still a-hurtin' and I know for certain
I'll even with you day by day

There's no use denying, you know you were lying
You wouldn't admit it was true
But soon you'll be paying for things you've been saying
That made me defeated by you
Happy we could be if you had stayed with me
But you wouldn't see it my way
I'm still a-hurtin' and I know for certain
I'll even with you day by day...
