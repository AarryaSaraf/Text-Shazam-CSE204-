// Begger To A King //

I had sunk as low as a man could go
The world had turned me down
Then you picked me up 
And you kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king.

Yes, you took the rags from off of my back
And you gave me your love to keep me warm
Yes, you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
And changed a beggar into a king.

I had walked the streets 
With my head bowed low
The sun for me would never shine
Then you came along into my life
And changed a beggar into a king.
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back
And you placed the crown on my head
Yes, you picked me up and kissed me sweet
You changed a beggar into a king.

You changed a beggar into a king...

// Three's A Crowd //

I've been looking through the window of the past
And I've seen the reasons why our love can't last
You've been seeing him and this I won't allow
Don't you know that two's a marriage three's a crowd
You're still keeping little things he gave to you
There are pictures and some letters tied in blue
And that night I've heard you called his name aloud
It's not right for two's a marriage three's a crowd
If you love him you don't need my company
Either close the door to him or set me free
You're the reason I'm alone with my head bowed
Don't you know that two's a marriage three's a crowd
One is lonely two's a marriage three's a crowd

// Poor Little Rich Boy //

(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Now theres an old saying I used to hear keeps a-running through my mind
How a baby boy born with a silver spoon was in for a mighty bad time
Pity the rich kid I've always heard, I can't for the life of me
While he's a-wading in a pool of riches I'm sinking in poverty
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
I work and sweat and played all day but what good did it do
[?] that I wasn't thinking of you
Cause a poor boys chances are mighty slim cause when I got into town
I walked by your house and saw your porch light burnin' and I knew who'd been around
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy...)

// Root Beer //

Well, I sent my pretty baby to the neighborhood store
My head was vibrating from the night before
I said: "You'd better hurry", as she went out the gate
My system needs a helper and I don't mean a steak
She had a cold six pack when she got back, but it was...Ahhohhh...hic-up...Root Beer

Well, now you can just imagine I was shocked to death
For nearly twenty minutes, couldn't get my breath
My mind began to wonder; Would I ever get well?
If I leave it to my baby, well, you can't never tell
'cause everything went numb when I saw what she'd brung it was...Ahhohhh...hic-up...Root Beer

Home Brew, Lightning, Bay alcohol, even good ol' Mountain Dew
Moonshine, Grapevine, any ol' kind would do

Well, now you could be my doctor, or my little nurse,
but get me something quick before I die, or get worse
I only need a toddy; just a little drink
Yeah, that should be enough to put me back in the pink,
but everything went black when I looked in the sack, it was...Ahhohhh...hic-up...Root Beer

Well, I began to thinking: "I'd be better off dead", 
but then I just remembered 'bout my ol' Uncle Ned
He's got a little business squeezing juice out of corn
and I began to praise the day my Uncle was born
'cause you can't get any kicks when you're in this fix; out of...Ahhohhh...hic-up...Root Beer

Home Brew, Lightning, Bay alcohol, even good ol' Mountain Dew
Moonshine, Grapevine, any ol' kind would do

Well, now you could be my doctor, or my little nurse,
but get me something quick before I die, or get worse
I only need a toddy; just a little drink
Yeah, that should be enough to put me back in the pink,
but everything went black when I looked in the sack, it was...Ahhohhh...hic-up...Root Beer

// What Am I Worth //

I know momma loved me
I reckoned that dad
Thought I was a pretty good kid
I've been blamed but I'm not ashed
Of a couple of things I did

I learned the golden rule
Before I started to school
Like ever'y little young'n should do
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you

What am I worth here on earth
Darling, If I can't have you
I just can't find no peace of mind
With anything that I do

I don't know why you made me cry
Honey, won't you give me a clue 
What am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you

I might get sent to be president
Yes, I'm sure I could do it for you
They would feature my face all over the place 
For all the good thing I do

I might get my name in the hall of fame
Or even in the book of who's who
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm mot worth anything to you

What am I worth here on earth
Darling, If I can't have you
I just can't find no peace of mind
With anything that I do

I don't know why you made me cry
Honey, won't you give me a clue
What am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you...

// She Once Lived Here //

The mayor gave me the keys to the city
the welcome wagons already appear
but again I'll be packing and leaving
for it's plain now that she once lived here
it may be that I'll never forget her
cause she's love and love lives everywhere
could it be that I'll always be saying
I've got to go for she once lived here
I see her face in the cool of the evening
I hear her voice in each breeze loud and clear 
oh there must be a town without memories
but not this one for she once lived here
I've got to go now for she once lived here

// Imitation Of Love //

They're making cheap imitations of everything
From rubber tires to leather gloves
But the cheapest imitation that I've ever seen
Was your imitation of love.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only foolin', you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of livin'
You were only givin' an imitation of love.

Why, when I first met you, you were so sweet
I thought you must have come from above
So I feel for you but when you made your play
It was an imitation of love.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only foolin', you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of livin'
You were only givin' an imitation of love.

From the very first time that I was kissing you lips
Till the last time I was in your arms
You were copying love and making believe
The you were faking with all of your charms.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only fooling, you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of living
You were only givin' an imitation of love...

// Open Pit Mine //

From Morenci, Arizona where the copper mines glow
I could see Clifton in the canyon below
In Clifton lived Rosie; we danced and we dined
On the money I made in the open pit mine
I loved my sweet Rosie and she loved me too
There was nothing for Rosie that I wouldn't do
Her hugs and her kisses, they were something divine
Gave me reason for working the open pit mine

While I was out walking with my Rosie one day
We passed a store window with rings on display
I bought the one she wanted; how they really did shine!
Spent the money I saved from that open pit mine
Her love would bring heartbreak that I would soon learn
Cause she would two-time me when my back was turned
Rosie would go dancing and drink the red wine
While I worked like a slave in that open pit mine

One night I caught Rosie on her rendezvous
She was huggin' and kissin' with somebody new
It was there that I shot her while their arms where entwined!
Then I buried her deep in that open pit mine
I took a look at my future and what did I see?
There was nothing but trouble a-waiting for me
But on the sun's next risin', I'll be satisfied
Cause they'll find me there sleeping by my sweet Rosie's side

// She Thinks I Still Care //

(She thinks I still care)

Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care

But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh, how could she ever be so foolish?
Oh, where would she get such an idea?

Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her, then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care

She thinks I still care...

// Running Bear //

On the bank of the river stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be.

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die.

He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting there on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave.

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die.

Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground.

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die...

// Best Guitar Picker //

I didn't think too much about books and schoolin'
'Cause there was more important things to do
I'd just sit out in the yard and pick my old guitar
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do

I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower
Wore my little fingers to the bone
Well, I said I would never rest 'til I am the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county

I said someday I know, I'll win my fame
One day all the world will know my name
I worked so very hard with that old guitar
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do

I would sit there all alone tryin' to pick out, old sweet home
While everyone was in the yard
Well, I said I would never stop 'til I've reached the very top
The best guitar picker in the whole county

The years have passed I haven't changed my mind
'Cause I still pick the guitar all the time
Because I know someday I'm bound to learn to play
All the things the big hillbillies do

I just sit her in my shop pickin', foggy mountain top
Tellin' everybody ain't that great
'Cause before I go to rest I'm gonna be the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county

I would sit there by the hour pickin' wildwood flower
Wore my little fingers to the bone
But I said I would never rest til' I am the very best
The best guitar picker in this whole county

// Sometimes You Just Can't Win //

Just when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
Then the clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just cant win.

My love never meant much to you dear
Or yo you I was always a friend
Oh, why did I call, 
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just cant win.

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I should't care 
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just cant win

And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's 
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win...
