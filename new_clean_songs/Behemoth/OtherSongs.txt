// A Forest //

Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl
If you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes

I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
Just follow your eyes
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again and again

// Conjuration Ov Sleep Daemons //

Ascending a fyre
A pillar ov flame on the wynd
Groan ov night I hear, howl ov gale
Lords ov green fields caressing the earthe

Silver sparks up high
Is Mercury above?
Is Mercury below?

So sleep!
And paint the pictures ov thy paradise
So dream!...
...waking dreams...safely
In accursed 'eternity'

I can't hear you from the lost ways
I don't want to look into thine sleepy eyes
Ov black soil I feel refreshing cold
Stone altars ov primaeval glory

And thunders are rumbling
Wyld waves are foaming
When I'm playing with the dancing fyre
With the terrifying grim ov freedom

Zechesh du kem Sphinx
Cuitem ino cuitem
Zechil' ru shechen soish
Dechep sechesh k'Nu
Zacho cem Had

I conjure the spirits ov sleep
I unite the circles ov beings

// Dark Triumph //

primeval god finally returns
comes a sound of triumph
I hear his voice
a dawn of evil prayer
a raise of million hands
revelation of our dreams

I open my eyes
I'm into the tomb
feel a touch of cool
carry beneath the gates

...and now lucifer comes
rides on the wings of winds
opens the gates of ancient towns
leads us to eternal delight
among the thousand flames
from dark to black again

his eyes are dark and cold
like northern frost
and icy breath
is a wind for the faithful

bring me there
where daylight never exists
and people live on gloom
bring me there
where I will be free
from god's tyranny

// Evoe //

Harken the laments ov the martyrs
The very music ov Thy name
Thou art the beginning and the end
Alpha and Omega
The creation and remains

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence

Thou art the asymmetry to the covenant divine
The magnet bonding black with white
Thou art unanswered "what" and "why"
Ignited passions and the longing in the prophet's eye

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence

I call upon Thee
Hermits ov the Earth

Pater Ecstaticus - come forth!
Pater Profundus - come forth!
Pater Seraphicus - come forth!
Come to reclaim the throne!

I sing my song to Thee
O planetary soul
In rapture I shall burn
To worship the unknown

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence

// Rise Of The Blackstorm Of Evil //

my black face in the shadow
of the pentagram
among the silent forests
in the never existing town
my fingers touched the sky
I was god in forgotten times
jesus and his servants were
sucking my feet

...lucifer, give me the power to rise

now I'm fallen
a down of misery
among the blurs of evil
hidden in morality
I had power to destroy god
my demons ruled the crowd
now I can do nothing
alone in black crypt

...satan, give me the power to rise

but there will be days
when I shall rise
a dawn of my kingdom
slowly comes
I will fight again
will take your mind
to sit on the golden throne
somewhere in the sky

...belial, give me the power to rise
...oh... oh... satan, give me the power to rise...

// Shadows Ov Ea Cast Upon Golgotha //

Am I the only one who beholding the sunrise?
In the ganglion ov deathless nights?
Drought I became, for all those at the bottom
As I shed lion's skin off my back
Into dismal deserts I crawl
To sustain my pilgrimage on Earth
Within your blood I submerge, my Lord
Within your blood I am drenched

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters surround
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters surround
Fire flows inwards

No words can voice the poetry ov my wrath
No foe dares to challenge my fury
My legions crushed, yet they speak my names
A pale halo casting shades ov disgrace
With blood ov the lamb I shall seal this pact
Amidst the sun and the moon
I am the spear ov Longinus
I am the arrows ov doom

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Ea turns inwards

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Ea turns inwards
