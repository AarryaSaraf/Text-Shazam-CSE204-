Album: AntichristianPhenomenon

// Antichristian Phenomenon //

Been haunted be the paws ov fear
And felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
And my voice was heard no more in heaven

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
Un not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

Come over to seduce your angels
Been born to rape your mother's holy womb
Rebel
So call me now
As I stand above ye all

Leave me unworshipped
In the dens below forever I shall dwell
Malice in heart was bred and lives again
My legions hid in south Eden
My flaming passions
Oceans ov love
And all thou call'st
The evil
I summon thee
Bringer ov war
Bearer ov light
Earth's son

Great in power
Thus call'st me almighty
In not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

// From The Pagan Vastlands 2000 //

From the land which hasn't entered yet
into the history
From the depths of swamps we are bringing
Proudly our name
As night, kissing the moonlight
-rebel children living in twilight
Like wolves...
...some named us so...

union with people from the sign
Of the half moon
To crush the golden walls of earthly heaven
To strangle the pestilence
Th the lands of mighty Empire
Others even think about us with fear
We invaded a state with a sword
In ours hands Roma means nothing
In the land of Slavs

Today forests sing about the legend
Long forgotten spirits
Whose names nobody remembers now
Waiting their day to reborn
Their visions of past
Are torturing our souls
Whispering in the dark
They will come again
To reign supreme
Believe my woods

From unrememberance
From Fire and Water
Ancient powers gather
From the burnt Arcona
...From the Pagan Vastlands!

Black horse rides across the sky
With a sword we will open the amber gates of Nawia!

Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidzš Chrystusa!
Dzieci Svantevitha nienawidzš boga-krzyża!

// Satanas //

On fire of darkness
rise a scream of hate
Sathanas want vomit
on son of God's face
your eyes have wrath
and promising a slaughter
the angels of Lucifer
are ready to destroy

Sathanas

Sathanas revenge's started
and the heaven is burning
God angels are deads
and the survivors are praying
the sacred cross is breacked
and demons are smiling
because your lord Sathanas
raped the mother of false

Sathanas
Sathanas

// Hello Spaceboy //

Space...
Space...
Spaceboy

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free

Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days

But moondust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me
Space fucking boy

Spaceboy, fuck you
Space fucking boy

Bye bye love
Bye bye fucking spaceboy
Bye bye love
Fuck up Spaceboy!

Bye bye my love

// Day Of Suffering //

A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come for me
And again you must die

So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words, feel my hate descend

Lord of light
I will swarm against you now
Gods perverse
Wickeds at my side
Misery
Thorns to lance your every word
Nazarene
Now I crown you king in pain

Suffer

Witchcraft, blood and Satan
Meet the face of Death
Blood
Fire
Torture
Pain

Winds of war, winds of hate
Armageddon, tales from Hell
The wage of mayhem, the wage of sin
Come and hear, Lucifer sings

Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood, command for war
Command for Satan, command for Hell
Command for blood
Command for Satan
Command for you
