// The Act Of Rebellion //

fucked by hecate
yet I shall not be yours
no fantasies nor the promised grace
I will chase you down
rid me ov slavery
strengthen up my mind
with a bliss from below

call me not, never, bow ye down, honour

ride the southern blaze, lighting up my throne
see me star arise, hear my nature's call
I summon the beast, call loud out its name
will never to fall, yet to be restored

heal me not, never, bow ye down, honour

te'o enashet anakaelo hecate seloen es esseka a
eloeono tee beyes emeggiel ekse derete ena'tiru
kaeon per'aa a emiel eschetar esie kau neres

// Inflamed With Rage //

listen ye all who can preach
I am the god's begotten son
I tell three woe shall be no more
woe, thou shalt end up in flames!

no horns I have nor pair ov wings
I am the balance ov thy universe
I have no number
I have no name
not fear'd ov laws
need to restrain

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones

speak ye all who can speak
keep thy instincts ever alert
thou art the stars that shine among us
and honour me as thee adore the sun

and stand ye all brave and proud
and watch the babel hill turn into ash
admire my shapes among the ruins of jericho
behold my wrath I hath showered the earth

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones
the paynim rite drew in my shade
I am the one who begot the earth

// Pan Satyros //

I, pan satyros
rise I through ye spiral light
follow'd I ye path ov a'yin,
where ye all-begetting eye rests
across ye cascade ov sensations
and ye consciousness ov body
volcano ov emotions am I
ye ring ov saturn -
two thousand years am I and more

by ye four powers ov sphinx
ye book ov albion open'd -
and four cherubic beasts
each in one quarter
wander'd across ye world

ye holiest gathering ov souls
ov ye fool empty sight -
ye devil - wild laugh
and my mourning, as snow white
paradox ov meanings
sacrifice is done
dogs ov darkness to ashes reduc'd
in ye sirius shine
that my way illuminates
in company ov heaven
ye eternal one
in madness ov night
in madness ov day

// Natural Born Philosopher //

without sin I can't make religion
as without sin there's no whoredom
and when in my heart god becomes a harlot
I shall sin, sin, sin again
("...every world has its space
every life has its time
every mass has its god
every god has his guillotine...")

to possess thy mother I desire not
nay, to slay thy father neither
'tis thy god I yearn to kill
thus reigning universal

with my beak I wanna peck at his face
and from ye golden cups divine blood drink
trespass borders which do not exist
I wanna be born, grow and rise again

and become! become you unity!
be all and nothing equally -
dust ov universe and its essence -
and look attentively
every star is a stone
in the cosmic pavement on which step you
and your oddysey has no beginning
and never look to far, you fool!
'cause it has no fuckin' end!

by nails tear this thin membrane
show me ye eye ov revenge
spit out half dead foetus out-consciousness
long live the man!
to god - quick death!
(your god is dead now...)

// Christians To The Lions //

behold bastard son
I am the evil one
no glory to be reached
no more thy slavery
the passion I besieged
spawn terror
smash thy will
ye pale dominion fades away my
will dominates

and watch my star arise
burning up the earth
sun - the eye of gods
threw into the space
watch ye moon eclipse
falling from thy grace
watch all nations cry
all feared ov his name
praise the flame!
watch angels falling from the skies
praise the flame!
I killed thy god
my will is done!
thou art lord

rise me! rise me high!
lead thru the gates ov sun
rise me! rise me high!
where angels do not dare to fly
invite to feast ov gods
and let me drift away
leave flames ov infamy
and watch me kiss the stars

// Inauguration Of Scorpio Dome //

mere emeles
mere selem
I em'a den
lashtal
lvcifer!
lvcifer!
aivass!

so every man and woman is a star
but who is scorpio by fire ring'd
where fall means increase?

when on the throne ov life he seats
the bloody sword ov freedom sways
and light ov hells in his eyes
and secret breath ov love

as the first whore ov the world
banish'd god from body
carnal divinity she restor'd
as infinite ov nightsky
augmn ov sothis
when tunnel ov tuat means disorder
past, future, painful
and from the eternal revolt we're born
to word can make flesh

a breeze- a leaf- a shadow the falling of a bud-
the wind across the meadow- a flesh of light-
a call- a patter on the wall-the air is bright as
blood a moment stands a shadow a moment
sounds a call

// In The Garden Of Dispersion //

on ye hill
where ye sun behind horizon hides
there is nothing
except our breaths
and crux of events
and some crux ov our hands

on ye hill
where shadow wings fell
wind rose ye to song
and we plung'd in its deep
and in plaitiv waterfall depths

evanescent recollection ov atavisms
secret ov living in ye death posture
and then...
the ye seal in the garden ov dispersion
closes ye mouth
closes ye eyes
closes ye ears

in fields ov eden
under ye first tree's rotting root
there's feast
typhon's feast
and night came moonless
but yet ye light appear'd -
picture ov sigillic angels
grafting in our holy body and mind

// The Universe Illumination //

ov circus my world wiseman call'd
ov drunken trickster bed
and not violators of thoughts they're
for life is a theatre
in which actors all we are
but when curtain is open
there is no time for any reh's

and as all lights turn'd on were
and the first act is begun...
...and the last my mouth I open'd
i, purple sage in the universal
and I speak in tongue unknown
and behold all stood in flames

su na'aq tem kah chaph keb ngaa sul tamed mes
no sedem cha'no umes maog etem chaph keb la'at
qui sulib

and hardly ye remember dark november days
when received ye rain ov sulphur
when earth came apart under thine feet
and wasn't it rage ov thine god
and wasn't ye his somdom
it's "only" laugh mine empty
sob silent and helpless gesture

// Vinvm Sabbati //

waters' running down
by the silver moonrays -
towards the foundation
reflecting themselves
in the mirror ov dreams
and creating deadly forms ov life

vinvm sabbati
crystal formula
melted by the fire ov lust

etera zetgiell
emoke selene a helios
bey este'ike eliech
zeresse'naa essekeeee

astral dominion
by the witches virtu's rul'd
desire equinox
tension releas'd
liberated
in the senses dance

vinvm sabbati
where the sigil branded
on the breast, for'head
and temple ov atlantis

rise we upon the ladder
ov blasphemies
towering o'er the heavens
where our empty laugh rings
and fingers touch the face
ov god disabled

// 23 (The Youth Manifesto) //

23 year ov long journey
among the living dead
on nonsense nourish'd I
my naked soul and where am i?
in the palace ov underworld
without enemy nor friend
pay I for fathers legacy
half-man, half-beast
DEMIGOD

and my hunger was never fed
my desires never fulfilled
but my wish to become
the one with universe
has always entangled me
and forsaken I shall not be
though my flesh is torn apart
though my heart seems dead and cold
my will transgress
the spirit lives on!
