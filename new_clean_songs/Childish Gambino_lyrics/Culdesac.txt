Album: Culdesac

// Difference //

[Verse 1:]
Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rapping shit's my Tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say hay like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy, vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
Facebook messages asking how I did it
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try to go hard

[Hook:]
I am just different

[Verse 2:]
I am so different, the games on lid eye
Listen to my mixtape, change your all shit up
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones
Haters say I'm changing, but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I ruined all their favorite songs
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate
Hatin on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape
Black Clark Kent, all I needs a Lois Lane
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane
Voice mail, E-mail, sending text message
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast
Believe me you don't want this, I am all about business
Life is a bitch, I must be dating her sisters
Got to be different, take chances like pictures
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches
I'm not at the top, but y'all niggas know I'm comin' fast
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one
Springsteen this city cause this city we were born to run

[Hook:]
I am just different

// Hero //

Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop

(Cheezy wassup)

[Verse 1:]
Let me hear you holla bitch: actor, writer, rapper
Nigga I do all of it
Lactose tolerant, addicted to cheddar
And I spent it on a jacket man I don't know no better
Yeah it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather
Yeah my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto
Keep my swagger Polaroid you can watch it develop
Ain't it funny in a year I went from different to special
Yeah I got it together, yeah I took those chances
Labels on me like I might cause cancer
Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom
I'm just talking real shit, hopin' you can handle
Sleepin on the jet like "lier" like chandle
Flyer than a jet women hoping they can land him
How we turn everything to gold that they hand em?
I am just different, that's the only answer

[Hook:]
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop
I'm a hero [x8], yeah

[Verse 2:]
Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater
She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater
Style with no name, they just want to label me
They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be
APC store walkin' out with eight bags
Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tag
You ever spend three grand on designer vision
When you should really spent it on your little sis tuition?
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'
DaVinci-esque, I'm the real deal
The only thing I don't know is how fake feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to em I fly 'em out
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys
I say I'm just a rapper, she tell me that's a fuckin' lie

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
They said me rappin' was like MJ and baseball
But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all
Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin fish
Listen to the next track I Be On That other shit
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one
And I mean girls too, intended no pun
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none
She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious
Barf on the track, the amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this
Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is
Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest
But I would never fail, I'm a hero one of the best there is

[Hook]

// I Be On That //

[Verse 1:]
I be on that other shit, I'm harder than a consonant
And that's because I'm flyer than the mother ship, you ostrich
I'm awesome rich. Call a bitch. Fresher than my lozenges
The problem is you in the Danger Zone like Kenny Loggins is
I'm fly, I'm tight. They say I'm sick, they right
You think you good? I swear, put your shit to bed. Good night
Yes, I'm sittin' on the bench cause I don't play no games
I just spit that Bellevue, watch them go insane
Why these mothafuckas think they wakin' up in pain?
Cause they sleepin' on the hardest nigga in this game
Hell yes, I'm on that zombie shit, I must get brain
They will not forget me, like I was hit by planes
I ain't got to do it big, I just gotta do it different
And these hoes are on my dick, and if you got it, it ain't trickin'
I be steady gettin' paper, call a nigga Dunder Mifflin
And these rappers cannot see me, I'm the only one with vision

[Hook:]
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it

[Verse 2:]
I'm on top of turd mountain; King shit, bitches
Can't nobody top that; Teen Witch, bitches
I don't make it rain, I bring the heat storm, nigga
Weezy F is in jail, I keep his seat warm, nigga
Yes, I get it like I live it
Yes, this pimp is still is pimpin'
Y'all don't want me to be different
What the fuck is y'all thinkin'?
That does not suit me, call it Ben Sherman
Cause I get more green than Kermit, heard me?
I'm in charge of new shit; Don't talk, do shit
Spittin' at the crowd like I play heavy metal music
I can say anything, call me John Cusack
Keep my dick wetter than the bottom of a cruise ship
Keep it fresh to death. Keep my swag inside a coffin
So fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner
Shout out to Marc Jacobs. Yeah, my feet be feelin' highbrow
And Band of Outsiders, got your tie on right now
Glory versus failure. There is nothing to it
Cause you win some and lose some, Sandra Bullock
Tell me when I'm way too much, when no one had faith in us
They thought Child was child's play, but now, they see we dangerous
Bring your girl around and let me show her how her body work
She like me cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken
Listen up, listen up, please. Check my steez
Insect ligaments, I'm the bee's knees
Watch my math, like 75 minus 6
How can number 2 be number 1?
Because I'm the shit, bitch

[Hook:]
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it

// Got This Money //

[Hook:]
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh

[Verse 1:]
I don't really know where to go
Don't know where to hide
Everywhere that I go
You'll be right by my side
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of
I wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb

[Bridge:]
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Hook:]
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh

[Verse 2:]
I got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft
Check the mixtape, baby. I don't talk
Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof. I work to relax, ho
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?
You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryna write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names

[Bridge:]
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Hook:]
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh

// So Fly //

You are the bestest, I will obey you
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who
You are the only one who's ever really seen me
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any tv
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad
And I don't really understand the thing we had
I wanna try again, but it would just be sad
And oh, oh whoa
You are the only one who's ever let me be me

We can make it easy
We can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me

So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me

We can make it easy
We can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me

So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me

// You Know Me //

[Verse 1:]
Bitch, get to know me
If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow
These dollars in my pocket gettin' big, I gotta fold it
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni
What the fuck is going on?
I'm in her bush. Before I eat, I make her mow the lawn
My career is like award shows, it's going long
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong

Bitch, get to know me
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe
I'm walking weird cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec
Man, I can't not not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp

Bitch, get to know me
You think you better than I am, then show me
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them
And I let them, cause they know if you reply, then you respect them
I've been working for a minute. Ho, this album's a success
I'm not tryin' to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best
Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches

[Verse 2:]
Bitch, get to know me
I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?

Bitch, get to know me
Half-price flat screens. Yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They tryin' hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, when you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these white kidses?
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole. One day, you'll have to wipe his

Bitch, get to know me
I know what I am, and I'll never be HOV-y
Cause I am just different. I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money in between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chillin' with Aaliyah

Bitch, get to know me
Bitch...

// Let Me Dope You //

Welcome to the Culdesac, this is where the street ends
I am just a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin'
Nigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch
I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend
Fuckin' with ya raw, bitch. My mouth should get tested
Sleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested
Gambino stay hard, can't nobody pull the cord out
A nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house

[Verse 1:]
Sick boy. Yeah, the clique on deck
Yes, I rap absurd. Got the game upset
And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke
And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah
I only put real on a nigga
Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga
Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga
Step away from the heat. They Shaquillin' on a nigga
Treat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em
Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bought 'em
The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em
I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle
You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin'
I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian
Drop hot shit. Yeah, my mouth's a laxative
Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident

[Hook:]
Hey playa, what's good?
Let me dope you
Hey hata, what's hood?
Let me dope you
I'm on fire like wood
Let me dope you
And you don't wanna fuck with dood
Let me dope you

[Bridge:]
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit

[Verse 2:]
I'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit
My cup runeth over, you can take sips
I'm in a spa, white robe like a racist
Niggas can't see me, I will pay for your Lasik
Fuck what ya heard, bitch. I'm flyer than you ever seen
My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen
Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline
Live inside a sauna cause I always got my self-esteem
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls
I figured I was different from these other guys
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25
These other rappers wanna fade into the background
I'm a stand out when these niggas done sat down
I always pack heat. Yeah, my mouth need a pat down
Money, girls, clothes. I don't worry about that now

[Hook:]
Hey playa, what's good?
Let me dope you
Hey hata, what's hood?
Let me dope you
I'm on fire like wood
Let me dope you
And you don't wanna fuck with dood
Let me dope you

[Bridge:]
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit

// Do Ya Like //

[Hook:]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like uh, uh, uh...

[Verse 1:]
Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gonna kiss ya
Know that you know me, don't act stupid
You seem different, tired of these groupies
I'm on fire, one fine figga
Got big shots sayin', "That's that nigga"
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me
I ain't afraid to say it, yeah I love these hoes
With their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes
Yes, I'm always on tour, what you mad at that for?
Slammin' that thing like a Cadillac door
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it, baby it's your birthday

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
It ain't trickin' if "you know", baby, I "you know"
Mama, you are with the right man, Juno
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen
I just wanna get you home and uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Yes, I'm drinking whiskey, baby I am gone tonight
NBC is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight
Gross, why the fuck I say these things?
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing
Everybody love me, call a nigga Raymond
These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire, f-fireman
Baby, I'm your hero, Donald for Spiderman
I'm in love with you, but this is not tennis
And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris
Rude boy, I Rihanna that vagina
Tell your boy, good luck tryin' to find ya

[Hook]

// I'm Alright //

[Verse:]
This is exactly what I wanted
All my fans love me
Dad is proud of me
Momma cries for me
Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead
These voices in my head
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it
I tell them that it better be, I did this shit on purpose
The worst is being worthless
Now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional
When I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But baby I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because

[Singing:]
Things are changing, my life's gone pecans
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends
All I know is baby I'm so tired
Record on Monday, tape on Tuesday
I ain't slowing down I don't care what you say
Fuck this health thing, Momma I'm alright

// Glory //

[Verse 1:]
I am the shit
I hold heat like cigarettes
No one else is doing this
Work this hard you get respect
I don't sleep, I dream awake
Swear this life's like make or break
I don't make I fix mistakes
Your life good, my life is great
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude
I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood
Seduce her quick
Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changin' shit
Talk don't make it happen
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Too tight need muscle relaxer
I'm what's next, just ask 'em

[Hook: x2]
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah

[Verse 2:]
I wanna do this right
Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic
And the game OT, no end in sight
So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night
This must be how the angels felt
I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself
I know that I drink an insane amount
Cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth
These guys don't seem like the friends I need
And they hang backstage drinking beers for free
My mom and my dad in the balcony
The one time that I hope they look down on me
Cause they proud of me
They call me a role model
Even though my hand's glued to that gin bottle
I keep my career going full throttle
Even though the pain will follow

[Hook: x2]
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah

// Fuck It All //

[Hook:]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seein' all this pussy, I'm a fuck it all
Fly around the world, eatin' good, drinkin' alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seein' all this pussy, I'm a fuck it all
Fly around the world, eatin' good, drinkin' alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 1:]
Tell em what it is, I'm takin' great strides
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up
Doing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying that's enough
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of Tylenol
Call em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me
I think it started when she said she happier without me
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say their all about me
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why
I think it's cause I can't really see myself an old guy
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast
So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident
I used to hate these haters, now it's just the opposite
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door
It makes me wonder what this rapping shits a hobby for
Oh that's right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so

[Hook]

// I'm On It //

[Hook:]
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it [x7]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1:]
Okay, one for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' filler?
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
Hate is mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd of thought this rapping make sense (cents), no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, say it with me

[Hook:]
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it [x6]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I used to be broke, No Cash
And them niggas played games, Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until it's last call
Erica Keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time
If all the time is running from me
There's so much I wanna do
Like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes
On all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right
But I'm on it though
Yeah I'm on it though

[Hook:]
Yes I'm on it
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it. [x3]
Yes I'm on it

// Put It In My Video //

[Hook:]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video

Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Verse 1:]
I'm blowin' up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls who turned me down are saying "please" and "sorry"
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "sm"
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay
Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say
I ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
And I'll all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth
I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about

[Hook]

// These Girls //

We are really close and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast

These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel
I wanna keep you real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause

These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all

I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

I don't have the heart - fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleepin' in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'

You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losin' everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because

These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all

I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

// The Last //

I'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I'm not afraid to try new things
Can't see me best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker no jokes, while these other niggas wakka wakka
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my Thundercat folder
My cousin was older
My momma used to wake up
Drive me to a school cause the school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up because
I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Momma couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rock Ridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne, but really
What I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
Cause it taught me most important is to do me
Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
Cause nobody was jocking my style
I had a high voice, they called me faggot eight mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on a role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life not "I'm On A Boat"
Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a motherfuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time
