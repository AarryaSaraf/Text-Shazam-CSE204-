We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are

// Algorhythm //

Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets
Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete
What was the motivation? Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses
Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient
Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission
Told her to call a friend, didn't tell her to listen
So very scary, so binary, zero or one
Like code is like coal mine canary
I dream in color, not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream
Go finally make a hit now
Humans don't understand, humans will sell a lie
Humans gotta survive, we know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life, is it really worth it? The algorythm is perfect, mmh

Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm

Step, step, slide, slide
Move your body from side to side
Clap your hands, don't spite the vibe
Keep on moving, you might survive
Pressure is to evolve, take a bite of the apple
We crush it into the sauce, how do we know the cost?
How do we know the truth without feeling what could be false?
Freedom of being wrong, freedom of being lost
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Feelin' like the devil did it (Devil did it, ooh)
Lord willing, I'ma step to it (Step to it)
You gon' fall behind if you can't do it (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, we eating good over here now (Yeah)
Is you eating good over there now? (No)
Dreaming ain't the move, do I care now? (No)
Looking for something worth it, the algorhythm is perfect, mmh

Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm (Woo)
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorhythm (Woo)
Algorhythm (Yeah, yeah)

// Time //

Seven billion people
Tryna free themselves
Said a billion prayers
Tryna save myself
I can see it coming
But it's moving fast

Big ol' hurricane
Put the sunroof down
Dancing with no pain
We wait to see the sunrise
It's a holiday (Hey)
When you're around (When you're around)
Breath of fresh air like a cold winter breeze
And I can feel it slow down, oh

Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

Oh, time, time, yeah

Running after something
But I don't know what
Am I running to?
Too afraid to stop
Hundred miles an hour
With no seatbelt on
Time is everlasting
I can't wait that long (Ooh)

Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams (All the stars)
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems (This whole world)
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow (Ooh)
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

I feel it falling to the bottom of the ocean
Running out of time, out of time, uh, oh yeah
Higher than motion, I can feel it moving forward
Running out of time, running out
Running out, running out of time

Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams (All the stars)
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems (This whole world)
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow (Ooh)
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

(Time)
(Time)
Uh
It's about power (Time)
All about power (Time)
Oh, I mean time
I'm just tryna feel it (Time)
Get a little bit stronger
Gotta go all out (Time)
And make it a lil' harder
Gotta look far out
That'll be better
Gonna get better (Time)
Too many pressure
Do you need pressure?
People need pressure
Uh, woo

Running out of time
We're running
Running out of time (Woah)
We're running
Running out of time
We're running

Lay back on my back (Uh), vibrate

She walked out the closet
Girl, never write a check I can't deposit
She said, "Boy, stop, let's go walkin'" (Let's go walkin')
"You wanna be outside for this"
We just talkin'
Dogpark looking like a Trader Joe's (Roof, roof)
Pepper Young, mmh, thought you hated those
Other girls, uh, let they shady show
Every time we walk around
They say, "How she gonna hold him down?" No

Goddamn, man, this girl goin' crazy on my Motorola
She said, "Let me answer it" (Let me answer)
Then she'll know it's over (Ooh)
Girl, you cancerous, you gon' ruin my life
Let me get this paperweight, then come be my wife
She just laughed and touched my face (What you mean?)
You don't understand what this is (Oh wait, wait, wait, wait)
I ain't lookin' for another lifetime
Let's just stay here and enjoy the great design
Had the iceberg tucked in my waist (Bling)
Fuck an omelet, you can eat off my face (No)
I just thought that we were vibin'
You don't love her, then you lyin'
Come and go and you get tulips
Put a finger to my two lips (It's okay)
Ooh, you got it bad, just remember what we had
You can set the snow on fire
The reason that your suffer is desire (Huh)
The reason that I'm moving with this ooh-wee
I was lovin' life, I got too deep (I was too deep)
Woke up in my room, she was long gone
Toni singing me another sad song (Ooh)
Eternity
Oh, until we meet again

Ooh
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Let me tell you something true

I remember, uh, back when I was six years old, uh
Daddy said, "The world's so cold"
"There is something that you should know"
Uh
"You're so gorgeous," thanks, daddy
"Nothing's really worth your time"
"But someday soon you just might find"
"The truth about the world's design," oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know that, yeah

Now remember, uh
You do what the hell you want, uh
But someone's gonna sell your funk
You're exactly what they want (Truth)
To be happy really means that someone else ain't
And balance ain't the one who claim
Everything is give and take, oh, oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know

Don't do it like this, okay (Woo)
Jump ship (Yeah, oh no)
Do a ditty now (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
Ayy, ayy, uh (Ooh)

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no
To be beautiful is to be hunted (I can't, I know)
I can't change the truth (I said), I can't get you used to this
Ooh, give it to me now, bring the strings back, uh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
We are beautiful, yeah
Stay so beautiful
That's so beautiful

Now he lookin' at nine, pray to God he don't speak

Life move fast, like a movie, so quick
Dark-skinned beauty got a booty so thick
She a down-home chick, she'll hit that lick
Had to drop my old girl 'cause she thinkin' she slick
I ain't seen him in a minute so I think he might flip
Had to hit him with the stick, man you niggas ain't, woo

Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
Two shots and a body, two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved

Where are those subtle men?
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls?
Who corrected, say women
I'm sorry, forgiven
Why would we ever change?
Planets never see a day that isn't towards the Sun
Bliss is a cheap emotion, everyone here seems to afford
So I don't know why I'm here without you, you

Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
When you're not invited, you take what you're given
Some wait every day for the call

Grief is a standing ocean, I never swam unless you did
So I don't know why I'm here without you
I miss you

Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all? (You)
I call to a spirit, you may never hear it
How else could I keep you alive? Alive

'Cause it's hard for me to love myself without you here
'Cause the days are slow, but the years are fast
I wonder when I'll feel your smile

// Feels Like Summer //

You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, that heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer

You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, that heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer
I feel like summer

Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, faster and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
(It is not the same)

You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, that heat
It feels like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer
(I feel like summer)
I feel like summer

Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees, that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing, waking up to no sound
No sound

I know
I know you know my pain
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world will change
But it seems like the same
I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change...
