// I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me), Pt. 1 //

When you touch me
When you touch me
Good God

When you touch me
Lookie here
I can't stand it
Can't stand it
I can't stand your love
I can't stand your love

You don't love nobody else
Get back; I can't stand myself
Can't stand your love
Good God

Early in the morning
Can't get it right
Had a little time
With my baby last night

Early in the morning
Gotta do the walk
My baby, just let me talk

When you touch me, good God
When you touch me, all right
Come on, baby, hold my hand
Just want you to know
I'm a soul man

Can't stand it
Can't stand it
Can't stand it; lookie here

Can't stand it, baby
Can't stand it
Can't stand your love
Can't stand it
I can't stand your love

Lookie here, baby
What you want me to do?
Baby, what you want me to do?
You made me, made me love you

You give me fever; my body's wet
You give me fever, break out
In a cold sweat

Baby, good God
Baby, lookie here
Sometimes I want you
Sometime I call
Sometimes I ring so hard

Come on, good God
Baby, lookie here
Can't stand your love
Can't stand your love
Can't try your love
Can't stand your love

I can't stand it
I can't stand it, good God
Can't stand it, all right
I can't stand it, all right

Bass, lookie here
Bass, Tim
Help me out, Tim
Show me how you work a little bit, Tim

Good God, Good God
All right... can't stand it
Wait a minute, Tim
Let me get this whole thing together over here
Can't stand it...

// Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby //

Darlin' I know I fell
But what could I do
I've had one chance
Now I'm askin' for two
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
I promise I try
Don't send me away
It's a matter of pride
Forgive me
Please, forgive me
Honey, forgive me
I love you
And that's no lie
You've been mistreated
I've got no alibi
But I'm gonna show you
There's a brighter day
I'll prove I love you
Every second of the day
Just forgive me
Baby, forgive me
Forgive me
As I stand alone
With the state of my heart
Won't you come back, baby
Let's make a new start
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If I could, he'd help
I know, I know he would
Alright now
Just forgive me
Baby, forgive me

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Darlin' I know I fell
But what could I do
I had one chance
Now I'm askin' for two
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
I promise I try
Don't send me away
It's a matter of pride
Forgive me
You just listen to me
Forgive me
Step right down
Forgive me
Forgive me
Do you hear now
I said I love you
And that's no lie
You've been mistreated
I've got no alibi
But I'm gonna show you
There's a brighter day
I'll prove I love you
Every second of the day
Just forgive me
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Forgive me
Forgive me
Lord have mercy
As I stand alone
With the state of my heart
Won't you come back, baby
And let's make a new start
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If I could, he'd help
I know, I know, I know he would now
Say it one more time
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If he could help
You know I know he would
Just forgive me
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Forgive me
Forgive me
Tell me...
Good God
Forgive me
Sometime I sit down and I wonder, now
Alright
I sit down and I wonder, now
I sit down and I wonder, baby
Baby, baby, I sit down and I wonder, now
I sit down and I wonder, now
Baby - baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Forgive me
Alright now
Forgive me, now

// Need Your Love So Bad //

I need someone hands to lead me through the night
I need someone arms to hold and squeeze me tight
And when the night begins until it ends
I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lying
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
I need your love so bad

So give it up and bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, plain and simple
So it can be read to me, tell me you love me
And stop driving me mad 'cause I need your love so bad

Oh, darling, I need a soft voice that will talk to me at night
Don't worry, baby, we won't fuss and fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad

So give it up, give it up, darling, bring it home to me
Or write it, write down on paper, plain and simple
So it can be read to me, tell me you love me
And stop driving me mad 'cause I need your love so bad

Oh, I need a soft voice to talk to me at night
Don't worry, baby, we won't fuss and fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad, I need your love so bad, yeah
