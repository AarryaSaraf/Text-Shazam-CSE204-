// A Lonely Little Boy Around One Little Christmas Toy //

A lonely little boy
Around a Christmas toy
A lonely little boy
Around one little Christmas toy
He was crying, he said
"I'm giving it up, I can't take no more
I've got to get even with you, you, you so and so
I'm gonna make a copy, I'll do every, every, every move
Can you feel it now? Now, ain't that a groove?"
And I said, "Don't get anger, son, you've got to come through
Because the same way you feel, now, I felt that same way, too"
Now sing it, he sang, "I've got to come through, I can't forget
I've got to come through, no, I just can't forget"
Don't let that one little toy get you down 'cause you're still out of sight
Yes you are, bless your heart, and don't you fret
And don't ever, ever, ever fall down

A lonely little boy
A lonely little boy
Hangin' around one little lonely toy
Can you imagine how he feels?
Other kids got a father to come home and say
"What you want for Christmas, son?"
And he recites everything he wants for Christmas
But the little boy over there stands with his head down
Tears falling on his cheek
I, I know how he feels, I know how he feels, too
Because that wasn't always a little boy, it was me
And sometimes I believe, that I know that it was you
Help him somebody, oh, help that little boy standing over there
He needs shelter, the rain is falling on his head
Help him, let him come in
Let the little boy who wanna get himself a Christmas toy
Do what you can, people
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Help him, people, oh-ho, oh
Lord, oh, help him, people
Hey hey hey hey hey hey, oh, oh, help him

// Santa Claus Is Definitely Here to Stay //

Ain't no use in saying there ain't no Santa Claus
'Cause Santa Claus is definitely here to stay in the mind
Ain't no use in saying there ain't no money in the bank for toys
'Cause it was put up a long time ago for a rainy day

Ain't no use in saying you don't love all your brats
'Cause I'm watching you as you hustle them off to play
Keep the family strong with a little faith, love and hope
And you can always get along

Ain't no use, oh now, in crying about spilt milk in the past
Because all the cats had a feast
Ain't no use in worrying about who's doing you wrong
Just leave them there and go away in peace

Ain't no use in saying what you gonna do and what you ain't gonna do
Because with your power, you doing your best
So release yourself from all that strain and take that money out the bank
And just give your, give yourself a rest

Take some of that money in the bank and give yourself a play
'Cause Santa Claus is definitely here to stay
Ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use

Ain't no use in saying, "Ah, I would like to get rid of them all"
'Cause you know you're only fooling yourself
So grab one hand on the wheel and the other around your kids
And go on and laugh yourself to death

Ain't no use in saying "I wouldn't, I wouldn't give a nickel for them all"
When you know you wouldn't take nothing for either one
So go on tell the truth 'cause if you don't you a lying son of a gun
'Cause you wouldn't take nothing for them all

Ain't no use, oh now
You know I probably won't be there this Christmas
But if I do I still want to say "Merry Christmas" to you and especially you
I wanna say "Merry Christmas" to all the people who can't find themselves
Let's try to get together live in peace
Love one another and treat each and man like he's your brother
With a little love, and kindness

// My Rapp //

Sweet thing, you're dead now
You're dead, yeah
You're out cold, but live on
Now, now at Christmas time, and the whole year round
Right on, right on
Look here, sweet thing, let me explain myself, baby
When I say "you're dead," I mean you're really out of sight
Out of sight, totally together
But you let me down now, you didn't even defend yourself
You didn't defend yourself
And you left me like, oh no, I can't say this on record
But I'ma try to write this little old letter and let you dig my little old rap
It starts like this, listen to it
For what it's worth, for what it could mean to you and I both, later on:

Dear sweet thing, fox, all the beautiful things, all the little names that I give you
I sit here so aggravated and bewildered because you didn't, you know, you didn't come home
You didn't come straight back to me last night
No fussin', no fightin', no nothin', you just up and split with another cat
Of course, I found out later he was your friend
And this much, this morning, I was able, I was able to understand that
After a very hectic night, you can dig the night was long
Now, I made it clear as possible, as possibly I could say it
Baby, don't go to strangers, come on home to me
Now, it's true, it's true, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothin' without your kind
That I see now, after 24 hours of sufferin', tears, cold sweat

Why does my girl always have to be
The one to go south and go away from me?
And leave me stringing on a tree, dangling on a string
That's alright, I'ma be there when you come back
But I'm gon' give you this little old rap so we can get this together
Since you gon', you know, smoke it in a pipe
But understand what I'm sayin', I want you to know where I'm comin' from
Now, like, I have a right, you know, to like come on with this old
Aggravated or antagonizing rap because I feel a little down
But I think you gon' make it alright 'cause you're just together that way
Now, baby, can't you be conscious of like every moment in the day and night
And let all of our moves be for each other? Together, you know
And completely out of sight, completely out of sight in every way
And how can I explain it when we live and concentrate on being happy 100 percent
In mellow tone, however
Yes, I know sometimes that you aren't mellow
But, you know, deep down inside I know you're mellow people
Well, at least, not as mellow as I hope you would be sometime
But you know how to do something about that, too
'Cause you're just too good to be anything but you
Now, I'm still, I'm still willing to help for, let's say, help each other
And I don't care what it take, even if we have to sleep in a tent
As long as I know that we are close together and that vibrations of your love and affection
And the warmth of you is there

Can't you see that this opportunity comes once in a lifetime?
Sometimes I wanna know, are you livin' in a past time?
Pastime things right before your eyes, you know
Well, sometimes it just seems it's impossible for you to see
You're not blind, you know, you're just hardheaded, stubborn, but that's alright
Those are the sweet things that makes you you, and I wouldn't take nobody else but you

You let my flame go out last night
You let my flame go out
You know, I don't expect, like, you can sleep James Brown or you can sleep your man
But since I'm your man, you can even sleep me, James Brown
That's what we're talking about, we're not talking about John Doe
Maybe Johnny Terry or somebody, or Bobby Byrd
We're talking about me and you, or you and I
You wanna be, you know, but saying me and you makes it close, you know
I can feel you that way
That's alright, just take your time

// I'm Your Christmas Friend, Don't Be Hungry //

The story of Christmas is as old as time itself
So believe me, brothers and sisters
Let's not put none of that good soul talent on the shelf
Have you been worried and lonely, and didn't know what to do?
Come and take a few of these simple lessons from James Brown, me
And you'll feel the same way, too

Ha, I do the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, whenever I'm blue
Don't worry 'bout nothin', get some exercise
And you can do the same thing, too
You know the story, on Christmas morn'
A sweet little baby boy was born
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend
I'm your friend

Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your friend
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm, I'm your Christmas friend
Don't be hungry 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your Christmas friend
Hey, listen to me, don't be hungry
When I'm in need, I dig talent to make my heart bleed
It makes my heart bleed with blood as red as wine
To dance is what makes me say I don't wanna cry

I've got the feeling, I'm soaking wet
Get up! I'm in a cold sweat
Alright now, alright now, I'm in a cold sweat
I do the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, whenever I'm blue
Don't worry 'bout nothin', get some exercise
You can do the same thing, too
You know the story, on Christmas morn'
A sweet little baby boy was born
Don't worry 'bout nothin' 'cause I'm your friend, I'm your friend
I'm your friend, I'm your friend, I'm your friend

Don't be hungry, when I'm in need, I dig talent
It makes my heart bleed
It makes my heart bleed with blood and fire
To dance is what makes me say, I don't wanna cry
I got the feeling, I'm soaking wet
Get up! I'm in a cold, cold...

// Merry Christmas My Baby And A Very, Very Happy New Year //

If a bell could ring
And make the whole world sing
Be cheerful about the rest
And always be the rest
'Cause restitution is the test

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

If a star could gleam
And make all the jewels seem
Like rocks made of gold
Excuse me, people, for being so bold
But I've got blood, sweat and tears in my soul

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

I love the way you wiggle your hips around the Christmas tree
I love the way you do those sassy mama things to me
I love someone who can be nice and gentle, and sweet and kind
So come on, make me happy this New Year

If a bell could ring
And make the whole world sing
Be cheerful about the rest and
Always be the best
'Cause restitution is the test

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

A very Happy New Year
A very Happy New Year

If a star could gleam
And makes all the jewels seem
Like rocks made of gold, ha ha
Excuse me, people for being so bold
