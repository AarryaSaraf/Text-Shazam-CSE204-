// Rising Power //

Dog day, Tuesday
Hope that girl she come today
Hard life, it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I've got my feet up, like to love
Through the dawn, till I've blown
All I want's her lovin'-down
Love the way she move around

Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's for abuse

Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You've got it

Love life, up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Love hard, dusk till dawn
Come the morning, she was gone
Took me out, to my surprise
Money blown, left high and dry

Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's for abuse

Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
Gonna end up torn to shreds

(That's the power!)

Don't need no excuse
My body's for abuse

Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
Gonna end up torn to shreds

Rise!
Rise!
I'm gonna rise!
Rising power
The power rise
From you

// Nervous Shakedown //

"Freeze!" said the man cruising the beat
"You get your hands up, spread your feet"
"Don't you move an inch", I heard him say
"Or you'll be doin' time until the judgement day"

And he said, "Don't tell me no lies, give me alibis
'Cause if you cross my path, you'll be doin' life"
It's a dirty lie

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We got a shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

It's looking like a set-up

"Take a dime," said the man, "you can make one call"
"You got a one way ticket to the county hall"
Well the judge looked high and I looked low
When he smiled at me it was a one man show

He said, "10-to-5, the jury decides
Double parole, if you survive"
It's a dirty lie

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We got a shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

Lord they're gonna get you this time
And throw away the key

(Lock him up)

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
You got a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Shake it down, shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Shake it down, shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
It's a shakedown

It's a shakedown on
You

Yes

// Landslide //

I want you to hear me out there
This is for all you bad boys
This is a story of "The Satan: Rock and Roll"
I want you to put your hand in your pocket
Take ten dollars out and send it to me, ha ha

Galileo
And Big Ben
Listen to me, baby
I'm gonna say it again

Well, momma don't scold her son
For what he been doin' upstairs
Daddy don't take him out, no-no
His sister just a-pull his hair
This boy is lost
It's a living nightmare
It ain't fair

That boy he don't know how to lose
He's out to win
He got the lot to top the last shot
Shaker, he's a breaker, he's a maker

He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide

Now, momma, he ain't no toy
And never, ever get his share
Got his smack in a gunnysack
Still'll be room for air
This boy is lost
It's a rockin' double dare, he's out to scare

That boy he don't know how to lose
He's out to win
He got the lot to top the last shot
Shaker, he's a breaker, he's a maker

He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide

Landslide, landslide, landslide, landslide

Well, preacher done say his prayer
Take him to the promised land
Momma don't allow, no, get outta here!
Never gonna give a damn
This boy is lost
Like a rebel for a cause
But he's the boss

That boy, he don't know how to lose
He's on a whim
He got the lot to top the last shot
Breaker, he's a shaker, he's a maker

He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide
Landslide, landslide
That man's a one man landslide
Landslide
Landslide
Landslide
That boy's a walk, talk, rockin' landslide
Get down

// Guns For Hire //

The word is out that I'm about
And I'm comin' gunning for you
I'm a real entertainer, a mischief maker
A lover of no fixed abode
Ooh, quick draw on the floor
No law, give you more
Sweet talkin' lover of sin
You want what you got
You get what you want
Look out woman

I got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire
The gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

On a wanted poster, a needed man
Runnin' right across the land
I'm a smooth operator, a big dictator
Gonna mark you with my brand

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire

Quick draw
On the floor
Big shot

Stick 'em up!

Hot to trot, big shot, take the lot
Never get the drop on me
I'm a real entertainer, mischief maker
Love in seven languages

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
This gun's for hire
I shoot you with desire
My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
A gun for hire
Shoot you with desire

What you got, big shot?
You can't get
You can't get the drop

// Deep In The Hole //

Go down
Go down

I've been enchained
She got shackles on me
That woman to blame
For the hell and misery

Can't find my way out of here
Shoot me down in a burning fear
Going down for a stretch of years
Way down low

I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole, yeah

I'm sinking down
She got me down on the floor
Can't touch both walls
The further down I go

Pulls the string on my riding bow
Make me sing when she fire my load
Ain't no slave, you do what you're told
You sold your soul

I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole
Ow

I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole, firing your load
Deep in the hole, sell your soul
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
I'm deep in, deep in

Deep in the hole, firing your load
Deep in the hole, sell your soul
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole
I'm deep in the hole

// Bedlam In Belgium //

The blood in my veins
Was running right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was running around insane

Three-fifty arrests
No bulletproof vest
Now ain't that a shame?
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said, "No way, 'cause you're on your way out"

Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

The place was a-jumpin'
And the booze was goin' down
There's a curfew in town
You'll be working overtime

We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run

Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah

Who's to blame?
It's a shame

Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam
Yeah

Get it ready

Stayed on the stage, cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more, it was war, war, war

Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium

It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on
Me

// Badlands //

I'm a pistol packing man
With a gun in my hand
Lookin' for a woman that'll understand
Ya like to roll and I like to ride
I'll stop at nothing, never take me alive

I'm a man with a fast hand
Loving on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man

In the badlands
In the badlands

I got a .45 that'll make you fry
Burn your chassis, lassie, like the 4th of July
I ride it hard, I ride it high
Make love to you 'till you reach for the sky

I'm a man with a fast hand
Lovin' on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man

In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands

Well, I'm gonna
Saddle up my six pack
Ain't gonna back track
My shooter loaded
Come on girl, I'm gonna give you a thrill

In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
(In the badlands) Looking for a woman
(In the badlands) As bad as me
(In the badlands) Gonna take her away, yeah
In the badlands
Yeah

// Brain Shake //

Alright, hold tight
I really want to ball tonight
On a bender, no space defender
A joy on the floor, I get it tight
Toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rockin' suicide

My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I can take
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

She's a mean, lean rockin' machine
A hip-hugging blue jeaned dream
She's a woman worth giving
A sweet sweet kissin'
Lips are running 'round on me
Well, it's a toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rocking suicide

My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

'Cause she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's an all out drive on a rocking suicide
It's a shake

Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Don't have to beg
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
You can't fake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Well it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain
It's a brain
It's a brain
Shake
