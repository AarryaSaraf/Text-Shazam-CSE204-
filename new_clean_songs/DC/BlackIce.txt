// Big Jack //

Steam is a-burning
Rocking up and down the line
The pot is getting ready
He's been working it so hard
When it comes to loving
Big jack is on his way
Wink of satisfaction

I'm like a bad defender
Smoking holy joe
He's a big pretender

Big Jack
Look out, Jack

He never leave a dollar
Racking up the balls
He like to get it on fast
Back there standing tall
When he hears the siren
He's gonna to put you on the racks
He got a bad reputation
Climbing on all over the bars

Gonna press the flesh
Rock and rolling soldier
He's the last of them all
We'll tell Jack
He's on his way

Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural to get you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always into trouble, coppers turn the other way
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always likes to party and he likes the girls to play
Big Jack

// Anything Goes //

Got a taste of a rocking band
Standing there holding out your hand
Better lock up all your doors
She's like a spinning dynamo

They're handing out the token prize
Giving you a brand new ride

There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes

Banging drums, rockin' on all fours
Heavy tune rockin', play it loud
You know she blown away all the others
You'll never let it up, take it on all night

You better razzle-dazzle on that stage
Keep a-rocking on all through the night

There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
Hey, hey, hey

A heavy rocking tune is playing
Playing as the night rolls on
Sneaking off with her Romeo
Where she goes, nobody knows

A heavy rocking tune is playing
On a fine new color T.V
Sneaking over, creepy-crawly
Never let it up to take it on through the night

There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
Nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes

// War Machine //

Push your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You been kickin' around
While you're messin' about

Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

Make a stand, show your hand
Call in a high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey

Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They're taken by surprise
And here's mud in your eye

Misery's the name if you shoot 'em for gain
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
Let's go

That thing gone wild

War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

I see trouble coming later

Well I'm coming to a boil
Sliding, going rogue
From a lift, come on down

Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight

The storm is raging
Winds are howling
No one is calling to rescue you
A flash of lightning
Our times are frightening
A rain is coming
And the sun don't shine

Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Stormy may day

The sky is darkening
The dogs are barking
A call for help
You hope they get you through
A clap of thunder
A split asunder
The people running
And the moon don't rise

Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy may day

Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Stormy may day

A little game of falling down
You rock and roll when the call come around

// Money Made //

Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made
Work work money made

Went right down to LA
They roped her in
She couldn't get away
Spreadin' cash all about, yeah
The die was cast
There's no getting out a matter money made

Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Keep it up, you get it made
Work, work, money made

Campaign in to Hollywood
She's living it up
It feels mighty good
Recommendations all around
Come taste the sweet life
That's what it's all about
That money made

Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Keep it up, you make the grade
Work, work, money made

Ooh, that money made
Ooh, that money made

Hit the gas

The party life is good for her
Getting outta bed nearly half past four
Her swimming pool is the biggest about
So don't you call, 'cause she ain't around
That money made

Strings of pearls, all kinds of chains
Shake it, baby, shake
Said shake, baby, shake
Shake, baby, shake

Ooh, just shake

// Rock 'N' Roll Dream //

Deep water all around me
And circle sharks all about
Deep in trouble
And I may turn around
Man up, and one man down
You pretty women, gather 'round
You can't pick up not a single sound
You feel you're winning, that's what it's all about
Knowing you weren't winning
And it could be the very last time

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

Circle sharks all about you
You come up and you don't know why
Where goes a woman with a warm embrace?
Does a man walk in the hard rain?
I'm amazed that they mess you around
You're coming up, and they're standing next in line
Give it a line and dive, run close
Hear me hollering, I get the most

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

Circle sharks, down and 'round
Deep water all around, 'round, 'round
Deep water all around and 'round

I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

// Rocking All The Way //

Well, one mad shuffle
He says two women is trouble
Sweat out a duel
I am humming right at you

I said
You did an evil raid
Coming on at night
You know to come along with you
You got to run away and hide
Two by two
Well, I said I am coming right at you

She's rocking all the way
She's coming out my way
She going all the way
She coming out to play

She's sexy in her boots, yeah
She tear up all the news
Shoot you in the back
Driving you mad
Come on, hear me out
And take my advice
She won't stop until you're in her sights

She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out today
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out to play
She's goin' all the way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah all the way

She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out to play

One mad shuffle
Two women trouble
Going to kick you right off the track
You got to push it, hug it
Trust her of it
She's going to make you pay, all the way
She's coming out my way
She's rocking all the way

// Black Ice //

Well the devil may care
You toss 'em back, you be a man

Every last time
Black ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Ooh, black ice
Black ice

Come on, bleeding out the walls
We're marching on, the women call
Many a mile I'd never take
I run for forty miles and I come up running late
Don't you know I live it down?
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around

Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around
Black ice

Women all living large
Shoot for the moon, you're gonna take it all
And I am going to rip it out
I'll kick, I'll creep-crawl down your street
I'll gouge your eyes out

Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice

My life
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around
I'll kick, I creep-crawl down your street and gouge your eyes out
Black ice
