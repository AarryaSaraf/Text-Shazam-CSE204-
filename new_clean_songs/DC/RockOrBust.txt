// Rock Or Bust //

Hey yeah
Are you ready?

We be a guitar band
We play across the land
Shooting out tonight
Gonna keep you up alright
You hear the guitar sound
Playing nice and loud
Rock you to your knees
Gonna make your destiny

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

We hear the siren scream
It sounds so lean and mean
We love to shake it down
Know what we're talking 'bout?
We turn the amps up high
The crowd's gonna hit the sky
We play it fast and loose
Because this night we're gonna pull the fuse

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

May be up to no good

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

// Play Ball //

Listen
Hit me up, fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said
It's party time when I'm on the loose
Make ya feel alright
(Listen) Drinks all around, I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine

Let's play ball
Shootin' down the walls
Let's play ball, babe
Battin' down the stalls
Play, play, play ball

Listen said
Light me up, I'm in luck
I'm off the leash and unbound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud

Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball

Hit that thing outta here
Hey, yeah
It's a home run

Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball

// Rock The Blues Away //

Driving in my car
We're headin' for the local bar
Pickin' up my girl tonight
Everythin' a-gon' be alright
Shootin' pool with my friends
Smokin' cigarettes
Tellin' jokes out loud
Laughin' with the crowd

And we rock it (and we rock it)
And we roll it (and we roll it)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we roll it
Baby, we rock it and roll it
We won't get the blues
Because

We rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day

And when I'm on my way back home
I listen to the radio
I hear some great rock sounds
That make you want to sing out loud

And we rock it (and we rock it)
And we roll it (and we roll it)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we roll it
Baby, we rock it and roll it
We won't get the blues
Because

We rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day

Rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day-ay-ay
(Rock the blues an' play)
Up all night and day
(Drink the night away)
Till the light of day-ay-ay

// Hard Times //

Feel her low
Goin' down slow
Make it quake
And make her body shake

Tryin' to hold you down
They can't push you 'round
They'll try to hold you back
Gettin' on the right track

Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run, make it fun
Freein' up the time

Heart a-pumping, feet are jumpin'
This hard loving keeps me running

They try to hold him down
But they can't push you 'round
Tryin' to hold you back
Gettin' on the right track

Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run, make it fun
Freein' up the time
Hard time, get on time
Throw me down the line
Hard times, get on line
Make a grown man blind

Hard times
These hard times sure ain't been good to me
Hard times, hard times
Sure been misery

Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run make it fun
Freein' up the time
Hard times, get on time
Throw me down the line
Hard times, get on line
Make a grown man blind
