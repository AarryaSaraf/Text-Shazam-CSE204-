Album: FlyOnTheWall

// Fly On The Wall //

Trapped

You got trapped
Gone down a peg, said yes

You can dance through the night
Rock-roll music, itching to fight
Making love, drunk or stoned
Looking for dollars, get broken-boned
It's a game
His tongue is too tough to tame
Ends up the same, sweating in the rain

I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out
There's a fly on the wall

Take a chance, take a bite
Rock-roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch making heat
Beatin' on my chest, licking at my feet
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ending up the same, sweating in the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall

I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

Yeah, I was trapped

I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
I was trapped (Like a fly on the wall)
I was caged (Like a zoo animal)
Enraged (From the fate that you make)
You're a snake, and I've had all I can take

There's a fly on the wall

// First Blood //

Got a screaming feeling
Need a little lovin' healing
Want some of that stuff
'Cause I like a hot touch, yeah
Want a little squeezing
Just a touch and teasing
Maybe wrong, maybe right
But I like it every night

Come on, baby
Down my way
Then we'll make it, night and day

I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

Some like it hot
Some like it quite not so hot
But I like her touch
And I want it so much

Come on, baby
Down my way
We're going to make it every night and day

I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

I like it hot, hot, hot, hot

I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)
I want first blood (A look in the eye)
Thirst blood (A need in disguise)
Bad dog (Come back for more)
First blood (First blood, yeah)

I wanted first blood
Some like it hot
First blood
Alright, hot shot
Bad dog, he come back for more
I want first blood

// Danger //

Don't talk to strangers
Keep away from the danger, yeah, yeah
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time
You just a-keep away

Ow!
Ow!
Just a-keep away, yeah
Ow!

Red lights are flashin'
There's been a misunderstanding, yeah, yeah
I'm bruised, broke and bandaged
Through drinkin' all that brandy, yeah

I was under the table, but I came back for more
Go to hit that bottle, but my head hit the floor

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Red lights still flashing
People all still dancin' in my head
I'm done with thinkin' about what to do
Another bout of drinkin', just one before I'm through

I was just raising hell, I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

Don't you go talkin' to no stranger in this town

// Playing With Girls //

Highball women that are hot to touch
Legs do the talking, spelling out, "lust"
See the sugar daddies with a sweet tooth and a smile
See what's hanging off him like an orphaned child

That's where you'll find me, standing proud

Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

Bring on the showgirls and the debutantes
Late-night waitress in a restaurant
Heading for the clubs and bars with the flashing lights
Looking for the good-time girls in their black nylon tights

Over the barrel, bottoms-up

Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

Ooh, river run dry
Yeah-yeah, you're only playing with fire
Ooh, wild sweet child
Playing with girls
Playing with girls

Playin'
Playin'
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls

Bring on the tall girls, but I'll take 'em small
I want 'em all up front, I like 'em all
I want to see you strut your stuff
Lose your social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace

That's where you'll find me standing proud

Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Like a long girl, short girl
Nothin' like a bad girl
Lover girl
Just playin' with a girl

I want all the women in the world

// Stand Up //

Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your thunder
Wouldn't want to play your game
Making all the headlines
Getting on the front page
Didn't even know her number
I didn't even know her name

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel, and a pretty face
Woman wanna get you under
Woman wanna get you tame
Loving on a hot night
Stoking up the flame
Didn't want to know her number
I didn't want to know her name

I didn't wanna know her number
I didn't wanna know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

You can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, you can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, stand up

// Hell Or High Water //

Get out my way
D'you hear what I say?

Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove
It's only rock 'n' roll

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me

Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you sing on me

Mama done told me
Daddy done scold me
Told me, shown me
You know that he showed me

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me

Mama done told me
"Poor boy, get home"

Hot living, trigger-happy feeling
Touch him up and tease him
You know it's so bad

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Told me, shown me
Rock 'n' rolled me

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Come Hell
Hell, Hell, Hell
Give it Hell

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

// Back In Business //

Breaking out, about to shout
Feel a need for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
If you want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wrecking ball, I'm a stinging knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life

You got screaming murder, lock up your door
Double dealing, got to have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be

Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag and bone
A bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale
Like a cannonball, goin' down the track
Need good lovin', but I want it back

I was found in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preaching what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell my boys that I'm gonna be

Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

You feel the burn?

(Back in business) You've read the small print in this contract, haven't ya?
(Back in business) Yeah, I'm the man with a shaft, haha
(Back in business) I oughta stick it right up ya
(Back in business) I've got you on mine
Back in business again (and I'm lookin' for ya)

// Send For The Man //

You
You wanted love

You wanted love
Dirty, dirty love
Don't want lust
Just a little love

You want a bad reputation
You want to better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door
(Ooh, yeah)

Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)

You're like a dream
You're dirty, low and mean
You're good enough to eat, yeah
You're sticky, hot and sweet

Need a shot of rhythm and lovin'
You make a black sheep a ram
This ain't no gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand
Yeah

Send for the man

Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
Ah, you gotta keep away from the decadent man
Send for the man (Yeah)

Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
(Yeah)
