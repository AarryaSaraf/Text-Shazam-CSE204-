// High Time //

It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

Been missing my roots
I'm getting rid of the flash
Nobody needs a thousand-dollar suit just to take out the trash
Ain't gotta be alone to feel lonely
I'm gonna turn off my phone, start catching up with the old me

It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

Been all wrong
Just wanna feel alright
Tomorrow, I might come crashing down
But for tonight

It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

I'm gonna let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

// Dime Store Cowgirl //

I've had my picture made with Willie Nelson
Stayed in a hotel with a pool
Driven through New Mexico where the saguaro cactus grow
And I felt really small under Mount Rushmore

And I made it all the way past Austin city limits
And maybe for a minute, I got too big for my britches, but

I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

Slept in a room with the ghost of Gram Parsons
Drank some wine I can't afford
Went to San Antonio to the riverwalk and rodeo
Seen the white cliffs of Dover from the shore

And I kinda fell in love with a Palm Springs trailer park
But those California stars could never steal my heart, cause

I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

I'm happy with what I got, cause what I got is all I need
Just cause it don't cost a lot, don't cost a lot, don't mean it's cheap

I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

I'll still call my hometown home

// Late To The Party //

They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there; we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into "who's leaving here with who?"
But I just want 'em all to see me come in...

Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
[x2]

Oh, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

// Pageant Material //

There's certain things you're s'posed to know
When you're a girl who grows up in the south
I try to use my common sense
But my foot always ends up in my mouth
And if I had to walk a runway in high heels in front of the whole town
I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And...

I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

I ain't pageant material
The only crown is in my glass
They won't be handin' me a sash
And that's okay, cause there's no way
You'll ever see me in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I try to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't
Yeah I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

// This Town //

[Spoken:]
We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day
And she got real belligerent
And she bit one of the nurses (Oh man)
And, I mean, she bit (ohhh) - you could see every tooth (nooo! hehe)
It took two or three of us to get her off of her
It's a crazy Wednesday

We finally got a flashing light, they put it in last year
And everybody got real happy when the grocery store got beer
And last time the census men came a-knockin', we were busting at the seams
Aw, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Big enough for a zipcode, a VFW
A good Mexican restaurant, a beauty shop or two
Got a Methodist, a Baptist, and a Church of the Nazarene
Aw, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean

Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
Cause they're way too hard to keep
Cause somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

You'll end up in the paper, wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around by Friday's football game
We only got one sheriff, but we all know how to keep the peace
Aw, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
Cause they're way too hard to keep
Cause somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

// Biscuits //

Taking down your neighbor won't take you any higher
I burned my own damn finger pokin' someone else's fire
I've never gotten taller makin' someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say don't say nothin' at all

Just hoe your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated, the rest of us have tried
The holiest of holies even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hangin' on the line

So hoe your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

Pourin' salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissin' in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
And I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and honey you can just do you

So hoe your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

// Somebody To Love //

We're all hoping, we're all hopeless
We're all thorns and we're all roses
We're all looking down our noses at ourselves
We're all flawed and we're all perfect
We're all lost and we're all hurting
And just searching for somebody to love

We're all liars, we're all legends
We're all tens, that want elevens
We're all trying to get to heaven, but not today
We're all happy, we're all hatin'
We're all patiently impatient
And just waiting for somebody to love

We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Just thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

We all wrangle with religion
We all talk, but we don't listen
We're all starving for attention then we'll run
We're all paper, we're all scissors
We're all fightin' with our mirrors
Scared we'll never find somebody to love

We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

Just tryin' to hold it all together
We all wish our best was better
Just hopin' that forever's really real
We'll miss a dime to grab a nickel
Overcomplicate the simple
We're all little kids just looking for love
Yeah, don't we all just want somebody to love?

// Miserable //

Your heart's as heavy as the stones you throw
Can't see the flowers for the weeds you grow
You blow your bubbles just to watch 'em burst
For you it's always bad to worse

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

Your neighbor's dirty laundry's cleaner
And the wolf at your door's always meaner
The sky's still grey when the sun's around
But you can't set sail with your anchor down

And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable
I'm miserable

Can't liven up for the both of us
We have enough for the whole of us
If misery loves company
Then I can't keep you company no more
You
You
You

You... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

// Die Fun //

Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do then so what
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

Let's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmmmm

We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby let's give 'em hell
We might as well
Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard,
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Mmm, mmm, mmmm, mmmmmmm
Die fun
We can't do it over

// Family Is Family //

They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em
They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

They're there when you're married, divorced, and remarried
You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by
Can't live with or without 'em; you might talk about 'em
But if someone else does, well, then you'll knock 'em out cause
When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

Yeah, family is funny, they'll ask you for money
Even though they know you ain't got no money
They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
They might not be fancy, but family is family

You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

// Good Ol' Boys Club //

I don't need a membership to validate
The hard work I put in and the dues I paid
Never been to good at just goin' along
I guess I've always kind of been for the underdog

Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
Shouldn't be about who it is you know
But about how good you are?

Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you but no thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club

There's a million ways to dream and that's just fine
Oh but I ain't losin' any sleep at night
And if I end up goin' down in flames
Well at least I know I did it my own way

Hey, hey-ey-ey

Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you but no thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club

Favors for friends will get you in, they'll get you far
But when did it become about who you know
And not about how good you are?

Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you but no thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be a part of the good ol' boys club
I don't wanna be a part of your good ol' boys club

// Cup Of Tea //

Maybe your jacket is a hand-me-down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares, maybe you're just round

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea

Maybe you're working in a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please

Maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail or maybe you failed
Out of college, but hey, life goes on
We've all got the right to be wrong

Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please

Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Why would you want to be?

[Whistle]

// Fine //

I pick those tomatoes we grew off the vine
They look out the window just killing time
I reach for the phone just to make sure it's on
And I'm fine
I put on my makeup for no one at all
My heels on the hardwood echo down the hall
And I open the wardrobe, put my face in your clothes
And I'm fine

I try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

Just like the circus, you always leave town
I can't help but cry when that big top comes down
But I leave the light on and when you get back home
We'll be fine

And I'll try to sleep but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm, I'm fine

They always say you don't get to choose
The same old cliche, love chooses you
So baby I'll wait just like I always do

And I'll try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

// Are You Sure //

Look around you, look down the bar from you
At the faces that you see
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
These are your friends, but are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
You seem in such a hurry
To leave this kind of life
And you cause so many things
Misery

[Willie Nelson:]
So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-bes
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

Please don't let my tears persuade you
I'd hoped I wouldn't cry
Although lately teardrops seem a part of me

[Both:]
So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-bes
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?
