Album: True

// Wake Me Up //

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)

// Hey Brother //

Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother, do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

// Addicted To You //

I don't know just how it happened,
I let down my guard...
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard.

Guess I should have seen it coming,
Caught me by surprise...
I wasn't looking where I was going,
I fell into your eyes.

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave.
Before I, I knew what hit me baby you were flowing through my veins...

I'm addicted to you,
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Out of control,
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

Midnight blows in through the window,
Dances round the room...
Got me hypnotized,
I'm getting high on the perfume.

I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

I'm addicted to you!
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Out of control,
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

// Dear Boy //

So bold and fine
I've known you for some time.
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine

Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you're mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Oh, boy, we're fine
Do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

// Liar Liar //

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

Follow you to dust
Leavin' footprints on the clouds as we're walkin' home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the daze on a diamond street
Kiss these apocalypse
Chasin' shadows, livin' dreams that don't exist
Anymore

We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

All closed and in your head
Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone
On a dark path in a rush
Sky clears all the rain over everything
Hear these apocalypse
Where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse, forevermore

We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

People talkin' but I can't hear them, no!
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find what I'll find out in the end
At least I'll find what I'll find out in the end

// Shame On Me //

Shame on me for loving you
Can't deny that you been untrue
Lie so sweet but you love to teach
Put the fire out with gasoline

I'm baptized and born again
You go to hell with your fucked up friends
Crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me.

All my life
(That's what I get for loving you)
Lie! Lie! Lie!
(No I can't live without you)
Why? Why? Why?
(And all the things you put me through)
Cry, cry, cry!
('Cause I get my kicks without you)

[Robo talk:]
That's what I get for loving you
No I can't live without you
That's what I get for loving you
Oh I can't live without you

Shame on me for loving you
Can't deny that you been untrue
Lie so sweet but you loving me
Put the fire out with gasoline

I'm baptized and born again
Imma raise hell for the better man
I'm a crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me.

All my life
(That's what I get for loving you)
Lie! Lie! Lie!
(No I can't live without you)
Why? Why? Why?
(And all the things you put me through)
Cry, cry, cry!
('Cause I get my kicks without you)

[Solo]

I believe in you and I
Believe in you, in you

I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile 'til you're outta my head

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move to show me where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

[Nile:]
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah, I got the time
That you need (yeah)

We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it outta the frame
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move to show me where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness

// Hope There's Someone //

Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

And hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed

Oh! Oh! ...

Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

And there's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed...

// Long Road To Hell //

Yeah! Our story goes
He went down to the crossroads
He sat down and kept his eyes closed
Well, everyone has a price, child
And what it cost him
Was his soul

You think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now who do you blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!

I don't know if I'll be coming home again, home again
No, I don't know if I'll be coming home
It's a long road to hell without no soul

Just when you think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now who do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!
Let me tell you it's a hard road to hell without no soul

// Always On The Run //

Take me from the city
Let's go for a drive
Take me, Take me anywhere
Just make me feel alive
Make me feel this fire 
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run

Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

We could save our money
We could buy a house
Hit back on our patio
Watching fireflies
We could feel this fire 
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy 
But we're always on the run

Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

// All You Need Is Love //

I was low,
Didn't believe in getting higher
Didn't know,
How easy it is to walk through the fire

Oh You opened the stars in my heart.
You let in the life from the dark.
It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love.

And I'm feeling, never letting go.
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe.
Do you feel it, it's like the first time
I realized that All You Need is Love.

Yea I'm feeling, never letting go.
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe.
Do you feel it, it's like the first time
I realized that All You Need is Love.
