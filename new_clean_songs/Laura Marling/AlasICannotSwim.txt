// Night Terror //

I woke up and he was screaming.
I'd left him dreaming.
I roll over and shake him tightly, and whisper "If they want you, then they're gonna have to fight me,"
(Oh, fight me)

I woke up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green
Oh a candle at my chest, and a hand on his knee.
I got up it was dark there's no-one in this park at this hour,
How do I keep finding myself here?
Oh, fight me.

If I look back and he is screaming,
I'd left him dreaming, the dangers fade,
I'll run back and shake him tightly
And scream "if they want him, then they're gonna have to fight me!" (Oh, fight me).

But if I wake up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green
Oh, a candle at my chest, and a hand on his knee.
I'll roll over and hold him tightly, and scream "If you want him, well you're gonna have to fight me!" (Oh, fight me).

Don't; fight me.

// My Manic And I //

He wants to die in a lake in Geneva,
The mountains can cover the shape of his nose.
If he wants to die where nobody can see him,
But the beauty of his death will carry on so
I don't believe him.

He greets me with kisses
When good days deceive him
And sometimes with scorn
And sometimes I believe him
And sometimes I'm convinced that my friends think I'm crazy
I get scared and call him but he's usually hazy.

At one in the morning the day has not ended
By two he is scared that sleep is no friend
And by four he will drink but he cannot feel it
Sleep will not come because sleep does not will it

And I don't believe him,
Morning is mocking me.

I'll wander the streets avoiding them eats
Til the ring on my finger slips to the ground.
A gift to the gutter,
A gift to the city,
The veins of which have broken me down.

And I don't believe him,
Morning is mocking me.
And the gods that he believes
Never fail to amaze me.

He believes in the love of his god of all things
But I find him wrapped up in all manner of sins.
The drugs that deceive him and the girls that believe him:
I can't control you, I don't know you well,
These are the reasons I think that you're ill.
I can't control you, I don't know you well,
These are the reasons I think that you're ill.

And since last time we parted, last that I saw him,
Down by a river, silent and hardened
Morning was mocking us
Blood hit the sky
I was just happy my manic and I.
He couldnt see me the sun was in his eyes.
And birds were singing to calm us down,
And birds were singing to calm us down.

And I'm sorry young man I cannot be your friend
I don't believe in a fairytale end.
I don't keep my head up all of the time,
I find it dull when my heart meets my mind.
And I hardly know you I think I can tell
These are the reasons I think that we're ill.
I hardly know you I think I can tell
These are the reasons I think that I'm ill.

And the gods that he believes never fail to disappoint me.
The gods that he believes never fail to disappoint me.

My nihilist, my happy man, my manic and I
Have no plans to move on.
But birds are singing to calm us down,
And birds are singing to calm us down.

// Ghosts //

He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says
"These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"

Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying 'I'm still mourning
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you'

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

So he went crazy at nineteen
Said he'd lost all his self esteem
And couldn't understand why he was crying

He would stare at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts that broke his heart.
oh the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
oh the ghosts that broke my heart
the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

He says 'I'm so lost,
Not at all well'

ooooooooooohhh [x2]

After it was done when there was nothing left to be
Turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
After it was done after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each other's shoulder

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I ever believed in
Everlasting love

// Old Stone //

He chased me through the rain,
'Honey, I'm going your way.'
I don't think so.
You can chase me through the rain,
And scream my name, a childish game,
But I love to be young.

And honey I was never gonna change,
And honey you are never gonna change,
But you love, don't you love it that way.

Old stone,
Ten thousand years and you're still on your own.
Don't you love,
Don't you love me that way.

And if you swear that you're alright
I'm not gonna try and change your mind.
Because the same night I dream that I lose you
I'll fall in love
Oh honey don't let me walk away from this
If I'm trying to fuck up my own life,
Then until I figure out why,
I think it's best you keep your distance
Lest I fall in love.

Old stone,
Ten thousand years and you're still on your own.
But you love,
Don't you love it that way.

He chased me through the rain,
'Honey I'm going your way.'
You can chase me through the rain,
And scream my name, a childish game,
But I love to be young.

// Tap At My Window //

He taps at my window,
Willing that I'll let him in.
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken I won't tell him again.

Maybe I'll write him a story and maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms.
Maybe I'll wake up lonely and fallen away again
Until you calm me down,
I'll race around this town.

Trying to find
Oh an emotion you cannot deny.
I will not have him treat me this way.

And Mother I blame you with every inch of the being you gave,
For I have become you and I know every part of your game.
And Father I love you, but how can you watch as I push her away.
I cannot forgive you for bringing me up this way.

Maybe I'll write them a story and maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms.
Maybe I'll wake up lonely and fallen away again
Until you calm me down,
I'll race around this town.
Until you calm me down,
I'll race around this town.

Trying to find
Oh an emotion you cannot deny.
I will not have them treat me this way.

So tap at my window
Maybe I might let you in.
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken I won't tell you again.

// Failure //

He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band.
He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand.
But oh, la la
He lost poetic ethic and his songs were pathetic
And he's a failure now.

And he used to be the life and soul of everyone around,
You'd never catch him looking up and never see him down
But oh, la la
He couldn't raise a smile, no not for a while
And he's a failure now

Don't cry child
You've got so much more to live for.
Don't cry child
You've got something I would die for.

And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again,
Because so many don't and so many go unnamed.

People push right past me shouting various claims
A preacher pushes me aside and asked to wash my sins
I said no, la la
If He made me in his image,
Then he's a failure too.

And I used to need a couple of people keep my head down,
Now I need a whole lot more to keep me on the ground.
But oh, la la
I gave up something and I gave it up for nothing
And I am a failure now.

Don't cry child
You've got so much more to live for.
Don't cry child
You've got something I would die for.

And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again,
Because so many don't and so many go unnamed.

// You're No God //

Your mum thinks you're sad
That you're living alone,
And your friends think if you're sad
You should call them more.
But the truth is
That you never needed someone to comfort you
Oh you've never needed someone to comfort you.

But you're no god, you're no god.
And you will never leave this place,
And you will always feel alone,
And you will never feel quite clean
In this new skin that you have grown
Until your old and broken bones
Are laid into their resting place
Just like the rest of human race.

Til I fall into my place,
Just like the rest of human race,
Til I'm laid into my final resting place,
Just like the rest of human race who've done it,
Without complaining all the way.

But you're no god, you're no god.
As long as you promise
That you will never leave
I need only worry about
You and me.

We will never leave this place,
We need never feel alone,
We will learn to feel quite clean
In this new skin that we have grown
Because our young and healthy bones
Would never lead us astray.

We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have
We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have
We will learn to feel quite clean, in this new skin that we have grown
Because our young and healthy bones
Would never lead us astray.

// Cross Your Fingers //

Look down on the body that you have grown
Four mountains stand around you they're not your own
And light squares and bodies are all you see...
Since you broke down
Since I broke down
Since we broke down

Oh I jump into your grave and die
And on my word you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn bigger and stronger
And less alive...
I... I...
I... I...

Cross your fingers hold your toes, we're all gonna die when the building blows
Cross your fingers hold your toes, we're all gonna die when the building blows
And the house that you were born in is crumbling at the corner
Sagging skin and feet of crows, feet of crows

I'll jump into your grave and die
And on my words you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn bigger and stronger
And less alive...
I... I...
I... I...

// Crawled Out Of The Sea (Interlude) //

Oh you crawled out of the sea
Straight into my arms,
Straight into my arms
[x4]

// The Captain And Hourglass //

<You kicked the blow, 
now you've got to kick the guy.
You sat alone, 
under bellowing sky.
If I feel God judging me, 
I fell into the water,
And now I'm free.

My friends they don't really get me,
think I'm the only one.
Well I sold my soul to Jesus,
and since then I've had no fun.
Behind every tree is a cutting machine, 
and a kite fallen from grace,
Inside every man is a heart of sand,
you can see it in his face.

And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

The wind and I we speak the same but he don't hear so well,
If you gonna have to curse him,
well you're gonna have to yell.
And the sky and I we've had our fights but I'm coming round to rain,
If the rain come out,
and I don't go out,
I don't ever have to speak again.

I can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
I can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

The captain's got his boots on and he's heading out the door,
Leaving his lady alone thinking, 
'He don't love me no more.'
He's done with all his bullshit, 
he's going back to war,
If heaven is as heaven does, 
then this is hell for sure

And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

You kicked the blow, 
now you've got to kick the guy.
You sat alone, 
under bellowing sky.
If I feel God judging me, 
I fell into the water,
And now I'm free.>

// Shine //

I have travelled past your window many times
I find your face too hard to define
I can't touch you hollow thing
You plagued my mind
I can never go outside
I will never go back to being blind

I have wondered what you're doing every day since last I asked
Your cheeks hollow I don't like your eyes dark

I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shine

I am honest now, not a shouter
I am reformed, reborn and forgiven
And you've been busy but you've missed me
And I plagued your mind
You will never go outside
You will never go back to being blind

I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shine

I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shine

// Your Only Doll (Dora) //

I fell into the street, poison in my veins
Clambered to my feet and into the night again
Back to my home, back to my owner
Who screams at my tardiness
Put his hands to the sky

And says, what can I do with a girl 
If she refuses to be mine?

In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine.

And what can you do with a girl,
If she refuses to be mine?

Put his hand on my shirt
Hand on my face,
Head to the wall
When you've broken your only doll

And what will you do with a girl
If she refuses to be alive?

And you've broken your only doll
And what will you do with a girl
If she's refusing to be alive?

There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
And a garden of such beauty
That the flower seem to grin

There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I live my life regretting
That I never jumped in

There's a boy across the river
With short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover
And I want to be his peer

There's a boy across the river
But alas I cannot swim
Now never will I get to put
My arms around him

There's a life across the river
That was meant for me
Instead I live my life 
in constant misery

There's a life across the river
But I do not see
Why I should please those
Who will never be pleased

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
There is gold across the river
But I don't want none

Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
I would rather be tried
Then held up by a gold gun

Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun

// Alas, I Cannot Swim //

There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
And a garden of such beauty
That the flower seem to grin

There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I live my life regretting
That I never jumped in

There's a boy across the river
With short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover
And I want to be his peer

There's a boy across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I never will get to put
My arms around him

There's a life across the river
That was meant for me
Instead I live my life 
in constant misery

There's a life across the river
But I do not see
Why I should please those
Who will never be pleased

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
There is gold across the river
But I don't want none

Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
I would rather be tried
Then held up by a gold gun

Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
