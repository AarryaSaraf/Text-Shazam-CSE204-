Album: DenimRhinestones

// Denim & Rhinestones //

Like jet black and a Cadillac
Like Tennessee and a bottle of Jack
Dolly and a tape deck on the way back to home sweet home

Like Mama and the kitchen
Cooking supper on the stove
Like a sweet tea and a lemon
We go together like denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like a classic jean jacket
Sparkle on the back, gotta have it
So good, so right, you can't go wrong when you slip it on

Like you and me, nothing missing
Even on our own
But when our lips get to kissing
We're fitting together like denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like the quarter and a jukebox slot
Like the key that turns a lock
Some things don't get any better
Than when they go together, denim and rhinestones

You're the smooth and I'm the shine
We're the neon dancing all night
Denim and rhinestones
You're the cool and I'm the fire
No, we're never going out of style

Like denim, and denim, and denim and rhinestones
Ooh, yeah
Like denim, and denim, and denim and rhinestones

// Velvet Heartbreak //

(Ooh, ha, ooh)
(Ooh, ha, ooh)

He'll get you comin' apart at the seams
When he calls you baby
He'll get you hangin' on every little stitch
That his lips are sayin'
He's cool, too good to be true
Looks so good on you
You gotta try him on
But don't cut the tags off if you take him home

That velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak

It's like a dress in the store that you can't afford
But you gotta have it
It's gonna be a discount rack, can't take it back
Waitin' to happen
Yeah, it's on you, do what you wanna do (Ooh, ooh)
But just know what you're gettin' into (Ooh)
If you slip it on (Ooh, if you slip it on)
The new wears off and it won't take long

That velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak
That heartbreak

It's that velvet heartbreak
Crush you like a fool on a Friday night
Saturday mornin' mistake
Pullin' the wool over your eyes
It's a love you and leave ya, double shot of tequila
Black mascara tears drippin' on ice
So smooth, until it ain't
That velvet heartbreak

It's a love ya then a leave ya (Mmm, mmm)
Double shot of a velvet heartbreak
Too good to be true, yeah
Smooth, till it ain't
It's a velvet heartbreak

// Ghost Story //

You're gonna see a shadow
Midnight playing tricks with your head
A silhouette float down the hallway
And you'll reach for the light by your bed
You'll hear a noise, swear you know the voice
And you'll chase it down the stairs
You'll look around, not a single sound
'Cause there's no one even there

I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story
Your ghost story

You'll be sitting at home drinking 'bout me
When I'm out with my friends at the bar
But there ain't enough whiskey
For you not to miss me
I'll be waiting at the bottom of the bottle in the dark

I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story, yeah
Your ghost story

Ooh, you'll wish you'd never said goodbye
Wish you never let me go
Let the love between us die
You can carve it into stone

I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story

Your ghost story, yeah, yeah
Your ghost story, yeah, yeah
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story

// Hate My Heart //

I'm free as a bird, no ties
Nothin' keeping my wings from flying high
And going out on the town on a Saturday night
'Cause he's gone, with the wind
And Lord knows I deserve to be flirted with
But the only problem is

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
Two drinks in
Makin' me a last call friend
I want my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

Yeah
I hate my heart right now

I don't want him back, that ain't it
But this thing in my chest just can't forget
It keeps beating for him and it just won't quit

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
Two drinks in
Makin' me a last call friend
I want my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

I hate my heart right now

One day I pray he'll stay out of my head
I keep waiting but it ain't happened yet

I hate my heart right now
Underneath the covers in the dark right now
Wishin' I was sitting in a bar right now
With a tall, dark last call friend
And my feel-good back
Instead of feeling bad that I can't get past
The fact that I can't love nobody else
I would if I could, but I don't know how
I hate my heart right now

I hate my heart right now
Oh yeah

// Burn //

Sitting there wrapped up tight
In your flannel button-up
With your arms around me
Watching those flames dance high
Where nobody could find us
Oh, but you sure found me
Yeah, we were lighting that fire
Heating up the sky like a July rocket
No, we never got tired
We'd stay up all night and watch it

Burn
Like whiskey in my glass
Even though it's sitting on ice
It's always gonna burn
Little too hot real fast
Like when you were mine, yeah
That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Every time I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn

Riding 'round rag top down
Little beach town
Weekend on the water
Under that gold moonshine
Your lips on mine
Couldn't get no hotter
Yeah, we were soaking it up
Buzzing on love and margaritas
When I see the sand and the sun
The salt in the air, I swear, I feel the

Burn
Like whiskey in my glass
Even though it's sitting on ice
It's always gonna burn
Little too hot real fast
Like when you were mine, yeah
That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Every time I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn, yeah

It's always gonna burn, just like this whiskey
It's always gonna burn and make me wonder if you miss me

That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Baby when I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn

It's always gonna burn, burn, burn

// Crazy Angels //

I'm a walking contradiction, baby, don't you try to figure me out
Got Holy Ghost conviction confliction when the sun goes down
You know where to find me on a Sunday morning
But tonight, I come with a whiskey warning

Sweetheart with a wild side
Girl next door with a rebel smile

Guess I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows I'm flying low tonight

I ain't the only one of us to come down onto this dive bar floor
You might not see our wings, we check 'em at the door
We could be dancing or at a booth in the corner
Never know what song we'll rock with that jukebox quarter

Guess I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows I'm flying low tonight

Crazy angels
Only the good ones get to hold onto
Crazy angels
Oh boy, you'll count your blessings if she falls for you

Yes, I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows we're flying low tonight

This crazy angel's flying low tonight, hey!
(Crazy angels)

// Faster //

Love song, dancing in the living room
Like the whole world's spinning 'round for me and you
We got red wine, pouring for a party for two
Just getting lost in the night

You know I love it when you play your guitar
When you promise me the moon, sitting under the stars
I only want to be wherever you are
'Cause whenever I look in your eyes

You make my heart beat faster
You make my heart beat faster
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

So tell me everything here in the dark
What makes you smile, what gets you falling apart
We can lay here 'till the morning comes
Hide from the sun, just keep on coming undone

You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

Oh
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

Ooh, yeah
You make my, you make my heart beat

// Pink Champagne //

Adrenaline rising
Ain't feeling no pain
I'm floating and flying, room is spinning, making me sway
And I ain't even had to go and open up a bottle of wine tonight

I can go on a bender
Anytime that I please
Don't need a bartender pouring over-serving me
I can get intoxicated on you, baby, anytime
'Cause you're mine

There ain't no last call, counting down on the clock
I can have all I want, don't be cutting me off
'Cause too much of your good love ain't a bad thing
And your kiss got me wishing I could bottle it up
Every sip to my lips is a sweet sugar rush
'Cause your love gets me more buzzed than pink champagne

Ooh, yeah

I still like my Rosé
Boy, don't get me wrong
But you're what I reach for when I want something strong
Never hungover, but I can't stay sober with you
And I don't want to

There ain't no last call, counting down on the clock
I can have all I want, don't be cutting me off
'Cause too much of your good love ain't a bad thing (Oh)
And your kiss got me wishing I could bottle it up
Every sip to my lips is a sweet sugar rush
'Cause your love gets me more buzzed than pink champagne
Yeah

One more round of you won't hurt me
I need you right now in a hurry, baby
'Cause your love gets me more buzzed than pink champagne

Got me addicted, don't wanna fix it

There ain't no last call, counting down on the clock
I can have all I want, don't be cutting me off
'Cause too much of your good love ain't a bad thing (Oh)
And your kiss got me wishing I could bottle it up
Every sip to my lips is a sweet sugar rush
'Cause your love gets me more buzzed than pink champagne

One more round of you won't hurt me
I need you right now in a hurry, baby
'Cause your love gets me more buzzed than pink champagne

// Wanted Woman //

Still bring me flowers
Tell me I'm beautiful
Even though you know I'm gonna say, "Yeah, right"

You know how to make me laugh
When I'm being impossible
You show me off like I'm the best thing you got

Right song on the radio
Turns you into Romeo
Next thing you know we're making out in the backseat

I feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal, you drive me crazy
The way you kiss me, touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Oh, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too

You know my faults, know my fears, know my tendencies
And still you're never gonna walk out that door
'Cause you're my rock, making all my insecurities
Disappear 'cause you're not keeping score

Baby, you're my better half
Best friend that I ever had
Yeah, I love how you make me feel

Feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal you drive me crazy

The way you kiss me, touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Oh, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too, yeah

Oh, you're all I ever wanted
All that I ever need
Oh, I love the way you make me

Feel like a wanted woman
I'm done running when you call me, baby
Baby, you got it
Got my heart locked up
It's criminal, you drive me crazy
The way you kiss, me touch me
Chase me, love me
You know how to make a lady
Feel like a wanted woman
Boy, you know I want you
You know you're wanted too

You know you're wanted too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm

// Poor Everybody Else //

Revlon on her face, like it's warpaint
Black car, back seat, sippin' champagne
She's a sweet thing, trouble is her middle name
She's looking for a little tonight

She's downtown and out on a mission
Five foot three, all demolition
Hotter than a cast iron in the kitchen
Just livin' her best life

She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Maneater with an appetite

Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on skin tight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in, rockin' like a hurricane

Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else

Yeah, poor everybody else

She had her heart broke once, said, "Never again"
That's too bad for the rest of them
'Cause she's givin' 'em a dose of their own medicine

She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Maneater with an appetite

Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on skin tight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in rockin' like a hurricane

Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else, yeah
Poor everybody else

She will steal the show
Everywhere she goes
All the girls on high alert
'Cause all the guys got eyes on her

She's a wrecking ball, looking for a wall to break
Thief in the night, trying to find a heart to take
Gasoline waitin' on a match to strike
Maneater with an appetite

Lips are red, heels are high
Dress is short, it's on tonight
Oh, get ready or get out of the way
When she rolls in rockin' like a hurricane

Better watch your man
Better watch yourself
'Cause when she walks in
Poor everybody else, yeah
Poor everybody else

Poor everybody else
Woo
Ooh
Mmm, poor everybody else

// She Don't Know //

She smiles at me all pretty
Walkin' up to me down aisle five
I wave and I smile back
And I can feel her eyes on me
She's checking me out in the checkout line
Cabernet in a paper bag

Yeah, and she's the reason
He'll tell me he's working late
And I'll go home and cook him dinner
Pour the wine and sit up and wait, yeah

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
She can have him

And I know what's been going on
Behind closed doors in room 310
From the laundry I've been foldin'
I can still smell that strong cologne
He puts on to hide the Virginia Slim
That she's been smokin'

But there's a cruel world awaitin'
Outside of them motel's sheets
'Cause he'll find himself another Jezebel
And she'll end up just like me, yeah

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
She can have him, she can have him

Yeah she can have this ring I'm slipping off
And this house I'm tired of cleanin'
She can have it all and have a ball
With this worthless piece I'm leaving

What she don't know is I know what she's been up to
I bet she thinks she got me played for a fool
But the joke's on her, in that bed that she's lyin' in
What she don't know, she don't know
Is she can have him
She can have him
Ooh, she can have him
She can have him

// Garden //

Where I come from, those big green pastures
Keep on rollin', they don't disappear
In the middle, there's a man on a big, green tractor
Hopin' it's gonna be a real good year (Gonna be a real good year)

Yeah, this back-home drive's got me reflectin'
Feels like God's askin' me some questions

If your words were seeds that were goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow? (Ooh)

Would it be warm like Eden or more like a desert?
Would the fruit be sweet or withered and dry?
Would the weeds take over 'cause it's been neglected?
Do your roots run deep, are your branches high?

And if your words were seeds that were goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?

Would you plant patience?
Would you keep kindness?
Would there be peace
Ripe on the vine?

If your words were seeds goin' in the ground
And your love was rain farmers prayed about
If your life was sunlight we all needed
What kinda world would it be?

If you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow?
Oh, if you reap what you sow
What kind of garden would you grow? Mmm

(Ooh) What kind of garden would you grow? (Garden would you grow)
(Ooh) Oh, what kind of garden would you grow?
