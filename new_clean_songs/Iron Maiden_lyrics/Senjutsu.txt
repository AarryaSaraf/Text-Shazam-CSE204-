// Senjutsu //

Beat the warning the sound of the drums
Set the beacons afire for them all
Call to arms all the men far and wide
Have to fight now for dynasty pride at stake

The invaders repel from the north
Keep out nomads who come from the plains
Northern grasslands awash with them all
Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

Survive on ledges bitten in dust
Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust
Really believe that they're coming for us
Dancing on graves
Of those who bled for us

Driven away by our endless desire
Defeat by anger and our greatest fire
Attack again and try as they might
Hold them again and see them running

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

Hear them coming - Ready now we wait
Must be steadfast - Must be patient

Must believe in - That we can win
What will save us - The great wall

Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now
Have to believe that we can repel them
Faith in the years our ancestors taught us
Have the belief that we can protect the wall

Try if they can we will overthrow them
Fight to the last they can never own us
Battle of wills we'll fight to the last man
Honour our dead so they never fought in vain

Hold our fortune - Avenge the merciful
Hold the great wall - Never fall again

Arrows falling - Dark oblivion - Live in spirit - Live to tell our sons

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

// Stratego //

How do you read a madman's mind
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more
Than you bargained for

Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation
Upon my soul

For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
There's no surprise

Ocean is black the devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born

Beyond the dark I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again

I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me I'm almost there
The pain almost too much to bear

I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing
Listened far too long

Little by little eat away
I think I've lost my mind
Too late to change now
What I left behind

Hear me listen my call
I am ready to fall
Lord hear me now - let me go

Ocean is black the devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born

Beyond the dark I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again

// The Writing On The Wall //

Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that's left of what we were it's what we have become
Once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?

Holding on to fury is that all we ever know
Ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon ~ holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes ~ when the burning sky is done
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a coming but you don't want to hear
You're just too blind to see

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?

Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?

// Lost In A Lost World //

All is not it seems to be on the outside
Sometimes what appears to be is a show
What shows in the face is only a mirror
We all have some better places to go

We don't know just what we have 'til we've lost it
Until that time comes and know that it's gone
So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago
Tear myself away from thoughts in my head

The people worshiping the sun
And all the children point up to the sky
They see the eagle as it floats on the wind
And they follow with their spirits high

Buffalo roam on the plain
We walk in to the flames but dance for rain
The hallowed dead in sacred ground and the elders
And we wash away their sins for them

Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race
And the testament to ancestors ~ that are never to retrace
Burn the flame of innocence ~ as they ride into the sun
Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon
Holy ground and sacred earth now
Revisit stolen youth

Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Lost in a lost world
Standing on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground...

Will we ever heal our old wounds
Like forever darkness worn
Fighting for their lives again
So come on now don't be afraid

This is where destiny lies
Just to let us breathe again
Put upon this earth to wander
And to walk ~ forever lost

With the ashes of our enemies
To live among our ghosts
Of our past fear nothing
Life is but a better path to joy

Nowhere to go nowhere to run
Our whole nation overrun
Itself existence under threat
And soon will be none of us left

Remember names of all our dead now
In enemies that fled
Reaching for our sky forever free
A sadness that is proud

As the clouds all drift away now
Until we meet again

// Days Of Future Past //

A war in heaven in god's rage
He put me in this burning cage
Holy fury locks me in
Imprisoned by my deadly sin

Every hour the shadow king
Wonders what his clock will bring
I've lived and loved and that's for sure
My fatal quest forever more

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

Once crucified you forgave it all
But my own life condemned to fall
Where's the glory in your name
My twisted soul still burns in flame

Hark you angels hear my call
Father witness to my fall
Between the lines of sin and pain
I walk the earth now doomed again

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die for evermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

// The Time Machine //

Put to the sword by an impish whim
Follow me now to a place we begin

Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear
Devilish children playing here

Hidden in silence, below barren waste
Confusion hunger, am I still awake?

Have I ever told you about my time machine
Sit you down I'll tell you everywhere I've been

I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire
Let me tell you about it, let me take you there

Does it really matter, it's all in the mind
Let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

I have lived a long life, I have seen the world
I could tell you stories, hair will stand on end

Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls
I have seen a god's face, I have no disgrace

I have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind
Where do I get started, when can I begin

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes
Father and sons give me all of your lies

The brutal truth, that is never a lie
Full moon is out, as you look to the sky

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Open your heart and I'll open your soul
Even in quieter moments I know

I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Eerie collection, darkness is there, wedded to danger
Betrothed to despair

// Darkest Hour //

We buried our sons, we turned and fled
No growing old, the glorious dead
But we came back because one man said
Now on the beaches the blood runs red

I faced them down, the only one
I stood alone and warned the day would come
But they were wrong, appeasers every one
And not for the last time, we all stand alone

I watch the sun move away as I embrace the night
And my black dog has its day for six long years you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates, we will overcome

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped
The whirlwind before the dawn
The darkest hour
The darkest hour

To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant till Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion awake defend this sacred land

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
The darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour

Here I stand in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind and now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
Before the dawn the darkest hour

// Death Of The Celts //

The road it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust, cry it out loud

Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead

The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake

Lord above, my spirit says
Death is not proud, no more, no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory

Wither a pain that's almost a joy
Wander there, my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Strangely, no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning, what must be done

Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty, freedom, maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done, faithfully

Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay

Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear, my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now, embrace it my friend

Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness, fortune favours the brave

Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore

Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore

Think I am, that I'm almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light, darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all

Following now where god can't explain
Bidding farewell, the life I'd have gained
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts

// The Parchment //

When the moon will rise again
Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears warring days are here again

'Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire, put out the fire

Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter now is given no less

Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace

Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin

And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness, our guide

In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king, we bow to him

Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter deep within
Invader punished with his life
Vanquished in the morning

Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell
Man immortal sickness dwell

Savage beasts troops engage
Assembled here to butcher blades

Smoke has darkened in the air
Smell of death and deep despair

Wilderness a tyrant dream
Sell your soul not give them power
Slay upon imperial crown
Witness now the witching hour

Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood

Never say a prayer to me
For this crime and treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you

Now an army is raised
And our gods, they be praised
Death is but a gilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge

Hear the cry we are ready to believe

The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again

A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand

For all those who have written
In the sand will be told
That the same will happen ~ searching for gold

Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife, meet me there

// Hell On Earth //

Beginning of a sunrise bores a big hole in the sky
Not to reason why that
Armed children are in this world
And fighting in the name of god's way
Mourning bleak and utter waste
The vanity of the world is assured now

Prey upon the weak no more
The spirits of those who are gone
Propaganda of the battles
That are lost or won

And count your blessings still alive
Of those who managed to survive
Inside oblivion of that hell on earth

All you have been, all you have seen
Lost in somewhere in your dreams

How the angels they have fallen
All is nothing what it seems

In the voices that you hear now
In the voices in your head
Now are thinking of a lifetime
You can never feel again

I wish I could go back
Will never be the same again
Bled for all upon this hell on earth

And when I leave this world
I hope to see you all again
On the other side of hell on earth

Upon the eyes of good
I'm following the light again
In between the dark of hell on earth

On the other side, I'll see again heaven
So far away from this hell on earth

You dance on the graves who bled for us
Do you really think they'll come for us
Knowledge and virtue taken by lust
Live on the edge of those that you trust

You think that you have all the answers for all
In your arrogant way only one way to fall
Burning a lamp that is fire in your hands
Taking you further from these lands

Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger
Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger
