// Where Eagles Dare //

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky

The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare

Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest

They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

// Revelations //

"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
[G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal]

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see

She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn

The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see

Go

Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you
It is you
It is you

// Flight Of Icarus //

As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly

Fly as high as the sun

// Die With Your Boots On //

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost

Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame

Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise

Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame

Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame

Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, die

// The Trooper //

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

// Still Life //

[Backwards:]
What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand

Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me

Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do

Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay

Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool

Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear

Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too

Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever

Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace

// Quest For Fire //

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone

So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

// Sun And Steel //

Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
And it's rolling still

// To Tame A Land //

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow

He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune

Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune

Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'

He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down

You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men

And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand

Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
