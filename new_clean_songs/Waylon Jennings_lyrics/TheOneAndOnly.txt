Album: TheOneAndOnly

// Dream Baby //

Sweet dream baby, 
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream.

Dream baby, got me dreamin'
Aweet dreams the whole day through.
Dream baby got me dreamin'
Sweet dreams in nighttime too.

I love you and I'm dreamin' of you
That won't do
Dream baby, help me stop my dreamin' of you
And make my dreams come true.

Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby
Sweet dream baby,
How long must I dream...

// Down Came The World //

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world.

She must have loved a little
Just to keep me hanging on
How could lips that kiss so sweet
Lie and be so wrong?

Our love was just a pattern
Of the perfect boy and girl
The only dream I own
In this world.

Down, down, down came the world
I went round, round, round in a whirl
I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world.

[Instrumental]

I built every dream around one girl
Then down, down, down came the world
Down, down, down came the world...

// John's Back In Town //

John does some singin' they call him a star
He plays with a hillbilly band
He goes lots of places picks his guitar
Old John ain't a home lovin' man.

John's got a woman he calls her his queen
He buys her them city made clothes
And she's 'bout the sweetest that I've ever seen
There is someting that John never knows.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be se
You'll know that John's back in town.

[Instrumental]

When John's out a tourin' I wear his best suits
Smoke up his old big cigars
I lie with his woman, wear out his boots
Shauffer his limousine cars.

When John's making money he keeps on the go
So if you should hear he's around
Buy one of his records or go see his show
Help me keep old John out of town.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be seen
You can figure that John's back in town...

// Listen, They're Playing My Song //

Down the street a baby just cried
When he woke up all alone
A train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound
Is chilling me right to the bone.

A song is playing I can barely hear
About a love that's gone wrong
The freezing rain on my window pane
Listen they're playing my song.

Taps being played by a soldier's grave
So sad it torments your soul
Just listen to that north wind moan
Tonight it's so dark and cold.

Somewhere a siren cuts through the night
Sounds like a whole world's gone wrong
Thunder just warned but it's coming a storm
Listen they're playing my song...
