Album: CleaningOutTheCloset

// Don't Look Past Me //

"I don't know, I feel a lot off
Distance and I feel far away."
I'll see you later..."

I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me

Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I
I am the sun

So close the door behind him
He wanders slowly to the car
Trying to lift his heavy heart
He says

"I feel bad about this
I feel really bad about this
Just, just let me feel bad about this."

I'm through just getting by
Countless times a friend has told me
Watch out for the wave
Now it seems the sea will be my grave
And still you swim to save me
Even though the water is much colder now
Even though the water is much colder now

Sometimes you can act on intuition
Sometimes you can use a different point of view
I've found that in such a position
I could always come to you
(Son) I've seen you weep
I have seen you tired and lonely (without you)
But it only takes one heart (one heart)
To lift you up and send you on
Can you understand the life I've shown you
Understand it's me, I'm giving you

I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me

I have no question in my mind
There's been no brighter star to guide me
I don't look past you to the sun
So don't look past me to the sun
The sun is

And so love is broken
They're asking me how can you help
When you don't even know how that feels
I don't need one thousand reasons
When someone starts to cry
When someone says my heart needs lifting
Don't ask how come, ask how high

I have seen you born before me
I have watched you die
I have heard every word you said to me

Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun, the sun is I

Leave no question in your mind
There is no brighter star to guide you
Don't look past me to the sun

// To Live Forever //

If I'd started from the top
And worked my way down
There'd be no reason
To live forever
To live forever

The starvation has turned
Me outside in
And the wind has blown
Me halfway across the world
Across the world, yeah

Why was I born?
In an age of distrust
I'd offered some change
For a photograph
It will always stay the same
You will always be the same

Until I show a desire for revenge
My hunger will waste me to sleep
As long as I have to die in the attempt
Then there is no reason
To live forever

I found you where, they left you there
A passing word that's gone forever
And searching my memory for answers
I saw the words of a letter you wrote

She said, "You don't have to live forever
You don't wanna live forever"
And everything's changing now
I don't want to live forever

// Raise The Knife //

Have I thanked you for your time?
Or will your life go unrewarded
Again?
Never asking for a dime
You just gave all of yourself
Until I turned my back on you
My friend

The powers that be made you a martyr
Conspiracy led you to slaughter
I tried to control it but as soon as I showed it
I was shot down again

Once again outnumbered
Appreciation slumbered
You can ask yourself why
But that look in your eye
Doesn't pass the test
You've been laid to rest, my friend
Again

Tortured artist bears his soul
Seems the pressure took its toll
Lived a life so punishing
Now he keeps the publishing

Spilling your guts out to a pad and pen
Communication to your silent friend

Raising the knife
To a picture of a life
(I once knew)
There comes a time
Compromising my life
(Just won't do)
I cannot lie
I can't try anymore
(To reach you)
I just can't fight
Raise the knife
Raise the knife
Cut through

I remember once you were the quiet type
Content to sit and watch the motions of your life
With false sensitivity
You cut yourself open so people would adore you

They all bought into your contrived sincerity
And how you wore your heart and soul right on your sleeve
Laughing sarcastically
You turned your back on the people who adored you

Self-absorbed exhaustion
Self-esteem distortion
Self-infused extortion
Self-serving abortion

I'll take the blame for these things that I say
'Cause I had the heart and the will and the courage to stay
Every day
I won't walk away

Reading through all the digests you show me
I notice the way that you think you control me
Doubting my future, you don't even know me
But I never walked out on you

Raising the knife
To a picture of a life
(I once knew)
There comes a time
Compromising my life
(Just won't do)
I cannot lie
I can't try anymore
(To reach you)
I just can't fight
Raise the knife
Raise the knife
Cut through

Raising the knife
To a picture of a life
(I once knew)
There comes a time
Compromising my life
(Just won't do)
I cannot lie
I can't try anymore
(To reach you)
I just can't fight
Raise the knife
And live my life
Without you

Raising the knife
To a picture of a life
There comes a time
Compromising my life
I cannot lie
I can't try anymore
I just can't fight
Raise the knife
Raise the knife
Raise the knife
Raise the knife

// Where Are You Now? //

Carry it away
Carry it away again
Have nothing to say
Nothing to say again
No one needs to be alone
Get my ego on the phone

Walking again
Walking again today
Who will I drain?
Who will I drain today?
No one wants to see me drown
And no one wants to be let down

Sorry about your secret garden
Is it too late to beg your pardon?
Didn't expect your soul to harden
Are you already gone?
Too late

Where are you now?
Blind and deaf
No one's left to come around
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare

You read the writing on the wall
Will Jesus catch you when you fall?
Heaven's filled with empty prayers
Pray too hard and no one cares

Sorry about your secret garden
Is it too late to beg your pardon?
Didn't expect your soul to harden
Are you already gone?
Too late

Where are you now?
Blind and deaf
No one's left to come around
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare

So there you are
Beyond the crowd
What do you hear to talk so loud?
Beneath the wall
Is where you'll fall
And wanting more
And losing all
(You're one step away)
Losing all
(You're one step away)
Losing all

Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna
Life ain't gonna
No one's gonna comfort you

Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Lost out there (Lost out there)
(Where eyes no longer)
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Lost out there (Lost out there)

// The Way It Used To Be //

Feelin' sick once again
I'd give anything
To be back home
Safe and warm inside

I can't stand the crowds
Or the smell that surrounds me
The cloth and key 
Still preach chastity

Take me back so I can see
The way it used to be

I lay down and enter a dream
Unlike anywhere I've been
All is silent and sweet

Then I'm falling down to the ground
And I'm lost from what I've found
Can't stand the sounds no more

Take me back so I can see
The way it used to be
The way it used to be

Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land

Radio waves 
Splash through my head
To a rhythm that I crave
Radio waves 
Relive the moment 
Seems like yesterday

Take me back to Twelve Mile Bay
Where I'll sit at the edge with my feet in the water
Take me back as the sun fades away
Break down the walls so I can breathe

Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land

Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within

The way it used to be
The way it used to be

Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within
Bring me to the land

Move me from the water
Too cold to swim
Bring me to the land
Move me from the water
That I see within

// Cover My Eyes //

I've got my hands out in front of my face
But I can hardly see
I've bathed myself in holy water
But it doesn't bother me

Under my skin, upon my head
Inside the walls, beneath my bed
My black and whites are turning red

Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind?
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind?

I've got my fingers to the blade
But I can't feel a thing
Open my eyes in salty water
But it doesn't even sting

Under my skin, upon my head
Stuck in my throat, beneath my bed
My black and whites are turning red

Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind?
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Under my skin, upon my head
The lunatic is playing dead
My black and whites are turning red

Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind?
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my mind?
Cover my eyes and tell me
Am I really blind?
Cover my eyes and tell me
Have I lost my, have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

// Speak To Me //

I remember when we were so young
You embraced my fears and made me strong
Never did you actually hold my hand
Your silence no one else would understand

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside

Do you like the clothes she wears today
Colliding love affair against a shade
Often times I wish she'd speak to me
Her holy open book, a world revealed to see

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me all you're feeling inside

So easy, easier
If you spoke to me
So easy, easier
Speak to me

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me all you're feeling inside
