// All My Love //

Darling, I really wanna know
Am I in your plan?
Can I be your man?

Darling, I'll never leave your side
If you'd be my blushing bride
I just wanna be your man
Please

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

Love that I feel inside for you
It's true

I'd walk through burning sand
Sail the ship on dry land
If I could be your man

I, I promise to be true
I'll be real good to you
I wanna be your man
Please, yeah

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

The love I feel inside for you
Oh, it's true

Darling, I'd walk through burning sand
Sail the ship on dry land
All I wanna do is just be your man
Please, please, oh yeah

All my love
I promise you all my love
All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live
I'll give you all the soul
I know that your heart can hold

All the love I can give
As long as we both shall live

// Back To School Again //

Spending my vacation in the summer sun,
Gettin' lots of action and a lots of fun.
Scorin' like a bandit 'til the bubble burst -
Suddenly it got to be September First. 
Woe is me, all summer long I was happy and free.
Save my soul, the board of education took away my parole.
I gotta go back, back, back to school again.
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three;
I'm gonna be there 'til then...
I gotta go back, back, back to school again.
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go... back to school again! 

Geometry and history is just a pain,
Biology and chemistry destroys my brain.
Well don't they know that I deserve a better fate?
I'm really much too young to matriculate. 

Well mama please, your child's come down with a fatal disease.
Mama said, "Come on you lazy bum now get your butt out of bed!"
"You gotta go back, back, back to school again!"
It's bye-bye fun, get your homework done,
You better be in by ten,
I gotta go back, back, back to school again.
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go... back to school again! 

I got my books together and I dragged my feet,
Then I saw this angel boppin' down the street.
I said, "Hey, pretty baby, howsabout a date?"
She said, "I'm going to school, and I can't be late." 

Well, I can see, that look in her eyes was sayin' "Follow me,"
And I was caught - I thought of playing hooky, but on second thought,
I gotta go back, back, back to school again.
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three;
I'm gonna be there 'til then...
I gotta go back, back, back to school again.
Whoa, whoa, I gotta go... back to school ... again!!!

// MacArthur Park - Part 2 //

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it

Oh I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
Oh but after all the loves of my life (After all the loves of my life)
After all the loves, after all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one (One)

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have all the things that I desire
And my passions flow like rivers in the sky
Yeah, oh
After all the loves, after all the loves of my life
Whoa, after all the loves, the loves of my life
You're still gonna be the one
Baby, you keep wondering
Wanna know why?

MacArthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet rain, I said, flowing down
Hey, now someone left it there
Living in the rain

I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to make it
And I'll never have, never have that recipe again
Oh no
Oh, lord knows

// Mean Green Mother From Outer Space //

Better wait a minute. 
Ya better hold the phone. 
Ya better mind your manners. 
Better change your tone. 

Don't you threaten me son. 
You got a lot of gall. 
We gonna do things my way. 
Or we won't do things at all. 

Ya don't know what you're messin' with. 
You got no idea. 
Ya don't know what you're lookin' at 
When you're lookin' here. 

Ya don't know what you're up against, 
No, no way, no how. 
You don't know what you're messin' with, 
But I'm gonna tell you now! 

Get this straight! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
and I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
and it looks like you been had. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space, 
So get off my back, 'n get out my face, 
'Cause I'm mean and green 
And I am bad. 

Wanna save your skin boy? 
You wanna save your hide? 
You wanna see tomorrow? (Ha-Ha!) 
You better step aside. 
Better take a tip boy. 
Want some good advice? 
Ya better take it easy, 
'Cause you're walkin' on thin ice. 

Ya don't know what you're dealin' with. 
No, you never did. 
Ya don't know what you're lookin' at, 
But that's tough titty, kid! 

The Lion don't sleep tonight, 
And if you pull his tail, he roars. 
Ya say, "That ain't fair?" 
Ya say, "That ain't nice?" 
Ya know what I say? "Up yours!" 

Watch me now! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
And I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother, a real disgrace, 
And you've got me fightin' mad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space, 
Gonna trash your ass! Gonna rock this place! 
I'm mean and green, 
And I am bad. 

Don't talk to me about old King-Kong. 
You think he's the worst? Well, you're thinkin' wrong. 
Don't talk to me about Frankenstein. 
He got a temper? -HA!- He ain't got mine. 

You know I don't come from no black lagoon. 
I'm from past the stars and beyond the moon. 
You can keep the thing, 
Keep the it, 
Keep the creature, they don't mean shit! 

I got garden style, major moves. 
I got the stuff, and I think that proves, 
You better move it out! Nature calls! 
You got the point? I'm gonna bust your balls! 

Here it comes! 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
And I'm bad. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
A real hard case. You can't beat this trouble, man. 
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space 
So just give it up. It's all over, ace. 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
I'm mean and green. 
(Mean green mother from outer space.) 
And I...am...bad!

// Midnight Flower //

Midnight flower
You got the power
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

I don't care
What people say you are
'Cause in my eyes, girl
You are a superstar

The way you move
Is like sweet music flowin'
And inside of me
There is a need that's growin'

No price is too high
Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
(Do something with me)
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

I don't fool myself
It's one side romance
But I'd gladly pay the price
For just half a chance

It's wishful thinkin'
For just, oh, tonight
Let me pretend, baby
I'm your heart's delight

Oh, baby, hey
Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

I, I just gotta have ya
I need your company
To soothe this yearnin' in me

Girl, I, I just gotta have ya
Could be the devil's gotten me
But only you can set me free, yeah

Don't put on me, baby
Love me, girl
Pour it all over me, baby
Your sweet love
Oh, so sweet

Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
(Do something with me)
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

// One Chain Don't Make No Prison //

Just because in a moment of madness
I took advantage of your sweet love
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness
When there's so little I'm guilty of

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

Can you spare me a little affection
Would that be askin' too much of you
Don't point love in another direction
I swear I'll make it all up to you

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
Can you hear, baby?

There's a bed I'm keepin' empty for you
There's a lot I know I got to prove
Don't let a simple misunderstanding
Be a mountain that we can't move
Ooh, ooh, baby

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

// You Keep Running Away //

You keep running away
You come back to me
But still you won't stay
Darlin you keep running away
Tear my heart apart every step of the way
You're here today and gone tomorrow
Leave this heart of mine in sorrow
Then you come around every now and then
Long enough to hurt me then you're gone again
Darlin you keep running away
Well I begged you not to leave but you never stay
Now you, you keep running away
Leavin me here to face another lonely day
To you all of this is just a game
Well each time you leave I feel the pain
But I've got so much love for you
I keep wanting you no matter what you do
All I want to do is take care of you
Everything I have in my life
I will share with you
This soul of mine has been processed by you
Darling my heart has been obsessed with you
Just look at me
I'm not the man I used to be
I used to be proud
I used to be strong
But all of that's changed girl
Since you come along
Your lovin sweetness
Is my weakness
Boy I need you dear
I just can't keep you near
Each time you go the hurt comes callin
My days become nights, darlin
My nights become so much longer
You're in my life, you're in my heart
But I can't get you
Get you into my arms
Darlin, you keep runnin away
