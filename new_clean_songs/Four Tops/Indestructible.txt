Album: Indestructible

// Indestructible //

We are friends, we are brothers
Always there lookin' out for each other
In a world where so many dreams are broken apart
But when the world tries to beat us
We hang tough, ain't no way they'll defeat us
You and I will always survive, together we're strong
Heart to heart
Any storm we can weather
You and I we've become
United forever

Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible (indestructible)
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible

There's a power, deep inside us
Ain't no one that could ever divide us
We won't fall, we'll show 'em all
Just what we're made of
You and I
We're in it together
We stand strong through it all
United forever

Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible (indestructible)
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible

Heart to heart
Any storm we can weather
You and I we've become
Untied forever

Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
We're indestructible (indestructible)
We've got the power of love
So strong we can generate
A wall of solid love
Nothing can penetrate
We're indestructible

// Change Of Heart //

Hey girl, he treats you bad
Leaves you at home on your own while he roams
Said he was out with the boys
Smells like sweet perfume
Lipsticks on his collar
His pockets ain't got a dollar
He staggers and he falls asleep
In the same clothes that he wore in the street
Wakes up and demands to eat
You're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
I know you got to have a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change of man, change to me

Every Saturday night he wants to start a fight with you
Either she ain't treatin' him right
Or just because he's high as a kite
He blames you because the sun didn't shine
And he blames you for what's wrong with his mind
He uses you as a scapegoat
If you can't see it
Let me pull your coat
He uses reverse psychology on you
Remember when you caught him with Nona
Didn't he accuse you of being with some creep?
Girl you're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
In fact I know you need a change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
Change of life
Change of man, change to me

Start me think about it he never says he loves you
And I don't think he do, do you?
I think he only thinks of you as he would an old worn out shoe

Change to me, think about it baby!
Change to me!

Change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change your man, change to me
In fact I know you need a change of heart
You really [?] change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me

Change of heart... change of life... change of man... change to me...

// If Ever A Love There Was //

I saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane

And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met, when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say

I caught my breath, I fell out of touch with time
'Cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew

I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Oh, but we've come so far, we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind

Love is a memory like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Oh, and I still believe, and I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

And I still believe, I still believe
All the promises we made

If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine

If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was
It was yours and mine
That was the, the time

// The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine //

It's hard to see you walk away
It hurts to see you go
But if I asked you to stay
Would it matter anyway

I'm not surprised you're leaving
I've known it all along
But my life will still go on
Yes, my life will still go on

I'll find a way to make it through
The long and lonely night
Find a way to live without you
Without you in my life

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you, baby
Without you, baby

Maybe I'll be better
Better on my own
I can stay out all night long
I'll have a good time when you're gone

Maybe it won't be so bad
To be here all alone
I'll have all the time to do
All the things I wanna do

So go ahead and walk away
If that's what you wanna do
'Cause I've got my life to live
And I can live it without you

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you, baby
Without you, baby

I'll find a way to make it
Through the long and lonely night
Find a way to live without you in my life
Without you in my life

'Cause baby, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright

But baby, baby
The stars ain't gonna dance across the heavens
The moon is gonna hide away forever
I know I'll make it through
But it won't be the same without you

The sun ain't gonna shine if you're not with me
I'll live without the love you have to give me
I'll make it through the night
I'm gonna be alright...

// Loco In Acapulco //

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Feel the pressure your back's against the wall
Love is gaining on you you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings get out while you can

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You'll be pulling out your hair drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go
Don't go
No! Don't go! Don't go!

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town, all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

// Are You With Me? //

Hey, I know it's a modern world
And things are really different today
Every girl's got to have her freedom
Well, it's supposed to be that way

All I know is everything that I feel
Let me know, is it real?

Now I'm not trying to tie you down
I'm not against a little fun
I just got to be your only man
'Cause to me you are the only one

All I want is someone who will hold my hand
All I need is someone who will understand

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

Now some guys like to dance every dance
And some guys only dance fast
Well, I don't care about dancin' at all
As long as I can have the last

From now on I'm just gonna sing my song
And if you want, baby, you can sing along

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

From now on, I'm just gonna sing my song
And if you want, baby, you can sing along

Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
That's all I want to know
Are you with me? (Are you with me?)
If you are, let it show
Are you with me, are you with me girl?

Baby, (Are you with me?)
Baby, honey, darlin'
This old heart of mine
(Are you with me?)
Been broke a thousand times
(Are you with me girl?)
Yes it has girl

All I want is someone to
(Are you with me?)
Hold my hand
I just need someone who will understand
My...
(Are you with me?)
(Are you with me girl?)

Just take our love
(Are you with me?)
Just take our love
To your hideaway
(Are you with me?)
(Are you with me girl?)
