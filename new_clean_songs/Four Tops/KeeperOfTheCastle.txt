Album: KeeperOfTheCastle

// Keeper Of The Castle //

Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
Oh, can't you see while you're pickin' on society
That the leaves on your family tree are callin' you to come home

You're the keeper of the castle, so be a father to your children
The provider of all their daily needs
Like a sovereign Lord protector be their destiny's director
And they'll do well to follow where you lead

Oh, in your head, you don't believe what the good book said
You're gonna strike out now instead, 'cause the world's been unkind
Put through thick and thin whatever shape your heart is in
You only have one next of kin better keep 'em in mind

You're the keeper of the castle, so be a good man to your lady
The creator of the sunshine in her day
Tend the garden that you seeded be a friend when a friend is needed
An' you won't have to look the other way

Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
Oh, can't you see, while you're pickin' on society
That the leaves on your family tree are beggin' you to come on home

Live it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around
Red, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their own
In your head, you don't believe what the good book said

// Ain't No Woman (Like The One I've Got) //

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)

Every day the sun comes up around her
She can make the birds sing harmony
Every drop of rain is glad it found her
Heaven must have made her just for me
When she smiles so warm and tender
A sight for sore eyes to see, ooh

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)
Oh no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love)

She can fill me up when it's down I'm going (I'm going)
Put a little music in my day
Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growing (it keeps growing)
Bigger every minute that she stays away
I would kiss the ground she walks on
Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey now, hoo-ooh

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot)
She's a real good friend right to the end
(So together like a hand in glove)
A lonely man when she's gone
(People, ain't no woman like the one I love)

Ooh, what a good, good thing I've got
She means to me a lot

(Ain't no woman like the I've got)
No, no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love, people)

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot)
I'm a lonely man when my baby's gone

// Put A Little Love Away //

He asked a question, you had no answer
The music finds you a sad and lonely dancer
Somehow you've lost it, what everybody's looking for
But yesterday's dead and gone, tomorrow's at your door

Better put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
So put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
So put a little love away

Two people sharing one tear too many
Look around for miracles, you know they don't find any
I've seen it coming but what am I supposed to do?
Just take a closer look around and simply say to you

Better put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
So put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
So put a little love away

Put a little love away
Everybody needs a penny for a rainy day
Put a little love away

Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
Put a little love away

Put a little love away
Everybody needs
