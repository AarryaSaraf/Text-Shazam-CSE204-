// I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) //

Uuh

Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (You come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind
And I've kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings (Can't help myself)
And there's nothing that I can do, ooh

Can't help myself (Ooh)
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
'Cause, sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face (I can't help myself)
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
(Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I'm weak for you (Weak for you)
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else (Ooh)

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
Do anything you ask me to (Ask me to)
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else (Ooh)

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you (Love you)
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you

// Something About You //

Darlin', darlin'
If I could have you to call my very own
I work my fingers through the bone, I am alone
To you I'd always come home

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire
I need you, yeah, badly
No matter what price I have to pay
'Cause without you, darlin', I'd worry hard
I love you anyway

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire

I'm just your puppet on a string
And tears sometimes it brings
But do me any way you wanna when you wanna
I'll keep you just the same

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

You're a real heartbreaker
You will never let me sit down
There's something about you, baby
That shakes me all up inside
You're a real heartbreaker
And I need you just the same
[?]

// It's The Same Old Song //

You're sweet (you're sweet) as a honeybee 
But like a honeybee stings 
You've gone and left my heart in pain 
All you left (all you left) is our favorite song 
The one we danced to all night long 
It used to bring sweet memories (Sweet memories)
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
It's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you been gone)
And it breaks me up to hear it

I, oh I, sentimental fool am I (Sweet memories)
To hear an old love song and want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Staying (Together forever)
Darling (Breaking up never)

(Now it's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it 
(With a different meaning since you been gone)
Oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone

Precious memories keep a-lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness 
I only reminisce the happiness we spent 
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

Now it's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone
Now it's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone
I, oh, I can't bear to hear it 
It's the same old song
(But with a different meaning since you been gone)
Ooh, it breaks me up to hear it) 
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning

// Helpless //

Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

Without a word without a warning
You left my life on early morning
Did I lean on you a little too strong
Too much of you I depended on
All at once I'm alone

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Since you've been gone I've been cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, darlin', since you're not around
I'm helpless baby

"Need some consolation, I need it, need it"...

Baby baby I'm helpless since I lost your love
Helpless 'cause now I need your love
I need your words of confidence (need it, need it)
I need those happy times we spent
Since you've been gone

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
All at once it hit me, I'm alone I'm alone

Oh helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless...

// Darling, I Hum Our Song //

Darling, darling
Although you're gone my love still lingers on
Although I miss you
I can no longer kiss you, 'cause for you belong to him

Darling, my darling
When I'm lonely I softly hum our song
I hum the part that says, "to me, you'll always belong"
Mhmm mhmm

And sometimes when I forget you're gone away
I remember as I softly hum the part that says
That you'll always be by my side to stay
I always wanted it that way

And darling, my darling
One day one day I hope I'll find
By a love that's true
Someone who'll love me too

Then I won't have to hum when I'm lonely
Hum when I miss you
And the part that says, "you'll love me only"
That's the part I like the best

Hum when I'm lonely
Hum when I miss you
And the part that says, "you'll love me only"
That's the part I like the best

// Since You've Been Gone //

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

It's my own fault baby, that I foolishly made you cry
I know I made a mistake but remember to forgive is truly divine
Come on back into these arms of mine
Come on back and ease this hurt inside

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Being without you my love keeps me as low[?] as a man can be
The places I know, the happy people I see
Only add to my misery
Come on back into my lonely days
Come on back with your sweet loving ways

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Don't have no future, lost it all in my past
When I lost you I lost everything i had
I know nobody ever loved me but you
Nobody cares the way you used to do
Come on back darling, please hurry
I need you, yes I do

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Darling, darling, oh
You got to come back, you got to hurry
You got to come back, you got to come back
You got to hurry, yeah yeah baby
You got to hurry, you got to come back
