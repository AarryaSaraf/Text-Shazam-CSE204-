// Only So Much Oil In The Ground //

There is only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be much around
Tell that to your kids while you're drivin' round downtown
That there's only so much oil in the ground

We can't cut loose without that juice
Can't cut loose without that juice
If we keep on like we doing
Things for sure will not be cool
It's a fact we just ain't got sufficient fuel

'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be none around
Alternate sources of power must be found
'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground

Yes, there's only so much oil in the earth
It's a fact of life, for what it's worth
Something every little girl and boy should know from birth
That there's only so much oil in the earth

There's no excuse for our abuse
No excuse for our abuse
We just assume that what we use
Will not exceed the oil supply
But soon enough the world will watch the wells run dry

There's no excuse for our abuse
No excuse for our abuse
We just assume that what we use
Will not exceed the oil supply
But soon enough the world will watch the wells run dry

'Cause there's only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be none around
You can tell that to your children while you're drivin' round downtown
That there's only so much oil in the ground

And there's only so much oil in the earth
Sooner than you think there's gonna be a heavy duty dearth
And there won't be too much time, for no merriment or mirth
'Cause there's only so much oil in the earth

We can't cut loose without that juice
Can't cut loose without that juice
If we keep on like we doing
Things for sure will not be cool
It's a fact we just ain't got sufficient fuel

(There is only so much oil...)

// It's Not The Crime //

I broke the law last night
Committed a criminal and sexual act
She was on top in this state
I said I went to get bopped

And though I didn't get caught
I know in my mind I committed no crime
Still by some fluke I'm here serving time
Oh no

It's not the crime
And it's not the thought
It's not the deed
It's if you get caught

I got some friends who like to stay high
Think of, the tax potential, if it was legal to buy
But instead the kid is forced to bust on victimless crimes
It's the look last bust, nickel and dime, oh oh

It's not the crime
And it's not the thought
It's not the deed
It's if you get caught

Think of all them profiteers
And how they got that way
Cause they sure the hell would not be there
Without the payoff game that's played
Think of what we could do
If it was you that was in their shoes
You either play the game or else you lose
Bad news

It's not who's sold
It's not who's bought
And it's not the kickbacks
It's if you get caught

It's not the crime
It's not the thought
And it's not the deed
It's if you get caught

// Maybe It'll Rub Off //

(Maybe it'll rub off)
This feeling that we got
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might decide to get hot
(Maybe it'll rub off)
This here jungle beat
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Make you slip on out your seat

Just might rub off
Just might rub off

(Maybe it'll rub off)
This music that we feel
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might have mass appeal
(Maybe it'll rub off)
This so called pagan rhythm
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might decide to get with 'em

Just might rub off
Just might rub off

It might seem strange to some of you
But it's a well known fact
We have compensated for
The pigment that we lacked
We always dug on rhythm and blues
We ain't putting on no act
So open up your mind
Open up your eyes and ears
And then to your surprise
It may be more than it appears

(Maybe it'll rub off)
This groove is gonna set you straight now
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Not too late to skate and gyrate
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Unless rubbing is a sin
And if it don't rub off
We're gonna rub it in, yeah

Just might rub off
Just might rub off
This music we feel
Is so for real
...

// (To Say The Least) You're The Most //

Ridin' on a white horse, galloping over the clouds
That's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Do you know what I'm talkin' about
I see a big pot of gold at the end of a rainbow
Sittin' at the bottom of the sea
I could swim myself about a thousand fathoms
'Cause your kiss is like gold to me
Hear mocking birds singing, tranquilizing
See a transparent woman she's a ghost
All the wonderful things that you do to me
To say the least, you're the most
You're the most

I see a tree in the jungle all covered with fruit
No other trees around
In the desert I'm lost, it's a wall of sand
But your kiss, girl, and I'm found
Such a beautiful trip all around the world
And your love is coast to coast
All the wonderful things that you do to me
To say the least you're the most
You're the most

I see some bright red shiny balloons
Four score and ten
I see a thousand swans, a bright shiny lake
Reflecting your love again
It's an uphill climb straight down to the bottom
It's a love disease, a fatal dose
It's not enough, but it's way too much
To say the least you're the most
You're the most
You're the most
From coast to coast

You're the most
Baby, most
You're the most baby
You're the most

You're the most baby
You're the most
Sweet fine thing
Fine as you can be
You're the most, baby
You're the most
From coast to coast
You're the most, child
You're the most
You're the most
Baby, you're the most

// Willing To Learn //

Why do I feel like there is now tomorrow
Sometimes I think that we're destined for sorrow
But maybe we might make it
With a just one more day
I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

How can I explain the way I feel about you
There must be some kind of way
To prove I don't doubt you
Well see It's all in how you take it
But girl, I know, I know we can make it
I'm, I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

The fact is I love you,
It ain't just spring fever, no no
Completely captivated
Girl, you made me a believer
Just breezing along with you
Should be more, should be more than I ask for
I'm, I'm just trying to tell you, baby
I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby

I'm gonna work my fingers down to the bone
I'll never, never leave you alone
I'll treat you right day and night

I'm willin' to learn
How to love you, baby
Gonna play a song for you all night long

Tell 'em how you feel, brother, brother
Sometimes you just gotta moan, baby
With words like "ooh"
You make me say "ooh"
O mama, you make me just want to moan all night long
I said, girl, I'm gonna treat you right
I'm gonna love you all night long

Said I'm gonna learn, baby
You make me want to do right
For the first time in my life

// Give Me The Proof //

Give me the proof that I need
I hear your warning, and I'm about to heed
Just let me know what you're saying is real
Try to imagine just how I feel

If it's like we're talkin' about
I don't want there to be no doubt

So just give me the proof that I need
I guess you know by now you done planted the seed
But the seed needs lots of light and time to grow
So if you've got proof positive be sure to let me know

Lord knows I'm tryin' to do right
So brighten up the garden light

Yeah, yeah
Give me the proof
Let's make sure it's the truth
You go ahead, give the me proof that I need

Yeah, yeah
Give me the proof
Let's make sure it's the truth
You go ahead, give the me proof that I need

Sitting on a fence just ain't no fun
Make me notice there's a smiling place on each and every one
If I was absolutely sure of what I'm going to do
I'd put my plans in action and immediately pursue

Some decisions are hard to make
You got to live with your mistakes

Yeah, yeah
Give me the proof
Just make sure it's the truth
You go ahead, give the me proof that I need

Give me the proof that I need
I hear your warning, and I'm about to heed

Give me the proof
Give me the proof

I got to have it
I got to have the proof that I need
I hear your warning, I'm about to heed
