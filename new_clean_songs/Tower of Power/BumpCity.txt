// You Got To Funkifize //

(You got to funkifize)
(You got to funkifize)
(You got to funkifize)
(You got to funkifize)

Move to the music, got to shout and shing-a-ling
You got to groove with the rhythm, girl, get slick and shake that thing
(Shake that thing)
Yeah, just let it be for real
If you've got the power
Now you all know what you got to do
You can't lay dead, just catch the groove, oh

(You got to funkifize)
Say
(You got to funkifize)
Now if you want to get funky, like a bow-legged monkey
I'm telling you
(You got to funkifize)

Got to kick to the backbeat before you get too old
You got to flash to the fire and let it grab your soul! (Grab your soul)
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Just let it be for real, bop to the rock
If you've got the power
Now you all know what you got to do
You can't lay dead, just catch that groove, oh

(You got to funkifize)
Well
(You got to funkifize)
Now if you want to get funky, like a bow-legged monkey
I'm telling you
(You got to funkifize)

They say it's in the blood
(In the blood, in the blood)
Yeah, they say it's in the blood, yeah
(In the blood, in the blood)
Somebody said it's in the blood, now
(In the blood, in the blood)
Well, they say it's in the blood, girl
(In the blood, in the blood)
But don't you know it's in your soul
(Don't you know it's in your soul)
Don't you know it's in your soul, boy
(Don't you know it's in your soul)
Ah, don't you know it's in your soul, mama
(Don't you know it's in your soul)
Don't you know it's in your soul, girl
(Don't you know it's in your soul)

(You got to funkifize) I'm tellin' you, know
(You got to funkifize) That's all you've got to do, now
(You got to funkifize) Talkin' 'bout that that funkiness, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You got to funkifize) Oh, woh, oh, yeah
(You got to funkifize) If you've got the power
(You got to funkifize) And let it be for real, why don't you?
(You got to funkifize) And I'm telling you right now
(You got to funkifize)

// What Happened To The World That Day //

I remember lonely days
Having no one to talk to
Drifting slowly from place to place
Never knowing just what to do

But I'm not lonely now
My outlook has been altered how
I've changed my attitude
I feel mellow inside

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Forever ever in my arms

Day by day a steady stream
Of happiness and sorrow
Facing changes as they come
For that always tomorrow

With you so close to me
Having all the faith that I'll need
To face the world outside
With all that I am

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Forever forever in my arms

A little here, ooh, and a little there
Patiently building our dream
Coming home at six o'clock
I can just feel the warmth of love

A guiding light
My hope, my joy, my reason
For living this life I lead
You're all that I need

What happened to the world (that day)
You came into my life (to stay)
Oh yeah, yeah baby

(What happened to the world)
I remember it well yeah
(What happened to the world)
It was on a special day baby
(What happened to the world)
Oh sweet mama
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
(What happened to the world)
Was you oh baby
That's what happened on the special day
Ooh
You come on in
And took control baby
I got to say it loud
Cause I'm so proud of you mama
Cause for now I'm proud
And we're together
Yeah baby say we're together
Me and you and you and me, baby
That's what happened on that special day
Come on in

// Gone //

Gone
Are the joyful days
Of sweet smelling pine
And morning mist
Gone
Are the joyful days
Like when the pine dies
And the mist dries
I, like a lonely gull, keep on searching

Gone
Are the joyful days
When the seasons change
I still remain the same
I turned to look for you
You were gone, ah yeah

You, you were gone...

// You Strike My Main Nerve //

You're messing with my mind
Think about me all the time
Why you wanna be unkind
The best man you'll ever find
I wish that you could see
Just what you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Girl
(My main nerve's been struck)
You babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
My main nerve
(Your boy's been struck)

When you hit the set
Smoking like a cigarette
My eyes light up like fire
For the girl that I desire
I wish that you could see
Just what you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Girl
(My main nerve's been struck)
You babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
My main nerve
(Your boy's been struck)

If I had my way
We'll be moving right today
That way that I've been struck
I swear that I'd been hit by a mack truck
I wish that you could see
What you do to me

You strike my main nerve
(My main nerve's been struck)
Get it babe
(My main nerve's been struck)
You got it
(My main nerve's been struck)
Talk about the pain
(Your boy's been struck)

That's what you do to me, baby
Ooh, mama, yeah
My main nerve's been struck
My main nerve's been struck
You have my main nerve's been struck
You did my main nerve's been struck
You you you you...
You hit the stick
Just smoking like a cigarette
You just strike my main nerve
Strike my main nerve
Hey baby
Hey lady
You know what you do to me
...

// Down To The Nightclub //

It's Saturday night and I'm just hangin' out
Lookin' for a place to party
I jumps into my ride and I hits the road
Cause there's only one place to go

Down to the nightclub, ooh
The women be righteously ready and pretty
To the nightclub
We go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump (Bump City)

Sitting by the dance floor checking it out
Watching the man with the fast feet
He got the hippest threads and the bad boogaloo
And a big old bag of tricks

Down to the nightclub, aha
You can get what you want if you know how to find it
To the nightclub
Ooh, we be slick, slick, slick

Ooh, the people be bumping (at Bump City)
The joint be jumping (at Bump City)
The mamas be humping (at Bump City)
Hey, while the band be pumping
Said the band be pumping
The beat be something
Ow, one time y'all

The night's almost gone and we're still going strong
The party's been so hearty
I hope it doesn't show while I'm driving down the road
That I had too much to drink

Down to the nightclub, well
If you've got the dough, the liquor will flow
To the nightclub
Tied on a drunk, drunk, drunk

Down to the nightclub, we go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump
Down to the nightclub, we be slick, slick, slick
Down to the nightclub, we go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump
Down to the nightclub, tied on a drunk, drunk, drunk

(Down to the nightclub) Well, if you've got the dough, the liquor will flow
(To the nightclub) Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
(To the nightclub) Look here, man, you get what you want if you know how to find it
(To the nightclub) C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
(To the nightclub) Yeah, yeah, Lordy, yeah
(To the nightclub) Look here, y'all, the women be righteously ready and pretty, hee-hee
(To the nightclub) Alright, now, now
(To the nightclub)

Down to the nightclub
Bump-ty, bump-ty, bump

// You're Still A Young Man //

(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)

Down on my knees
Oh, heart in hand
I was accused of being too young
But I'm not so young
Can't you understand
That I think like a man

(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time) oh, no, no, baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
I'm not wasting my time
(Don't waste your time)

Back once again
Ooh, just begging you please
Darling, think twice about me
'Cause I'm not so bad
I could make you happy
I'm not a mad lad

(You're too young to love) If you and I could be together
(You're too young to love) I'd get to you through any weather
(You're too young to love) I love you, yes I love you only
(You're too young to love) I'll never, never leave you a-lonely
(You're too young woo-ooh) No, I won't, sweet lady
(Don't waste your time)

The damage is done
You'll see that you were wrong
You'll wake up wondering just
How well I've done
Well, I've done all right
Yes, there are some girls
But you know I'd drop them on sight
Just for you
Because I love you

(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)

I'm not a young man, baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
And I don't feel that I'm wasting my time
Not when it's you, girl
You better believe
(Don't waste your time)

Someday you'll understand just what it means
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
When a man comes to you
With his little heart in his hands
Just to love you
(Don't waste your time)

Just to get up next to you and hold you, oh baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
You say that I'm wasting my time
Well, it's my time, baby
(Don't waste your time)
It's you-you-you, you-you, you-you
You better listen to me

Sayin' I'm loving you, yeah
Yeah hey, yeah hey, hey now, baby
Tryna tell you that it's you-you-you...
Talkin' to you, baby
I'll never never, never never
I'll never never do you no wrong, no no, lady
If you would check my stuff out one time, haha
Just to hold you, just to squeeze you
And all I wanna do is to get next to you
And please, please, please you, baby
You can see it where I'm comin' from
