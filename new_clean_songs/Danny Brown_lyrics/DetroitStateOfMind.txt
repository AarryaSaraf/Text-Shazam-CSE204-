Album: DetroitStateOfMind

// Broadcaster //

I done moved a lotta stones but I ain't an Egyptian
I made work disappear but I ain't a magician
I seen fiends lose weight offa crack nutrition
I get them checks on the first like a monthly subscription
They holla at me every day because they need their prescription
I'm like a male cheerleader: white girls are flippin'
Make Christians lose religions off the shit that I'm spittin'
I got families diminishin' offa what I'm distributin'
Finishin' the gimmicks with the shit I'm deliverin'
You're about to go fast like Thanksgivin' chit-er-lins
Don't end up a memory, niggas just rememberin'
Death anniversary, pourin' out some beer again
True Religion jeans with the laced up Timberlands
Bucket seats, bucket hat low like Gilligan
Hit your baby momma, left her panties on the ceilin' fan
Sent her to voicemail, but she gonna call again
Brown done came up and he won't fall again
Spittin for the hustlers cause the words are the empowerment
Smarter than those white boys in Ivy league colleges
But I used to move work to white boys in colleges

Most you rap niggas lyin' like a horoscope
Homie you homo like the Rocky Picture Horror Show
Seats in the Chevy same color as a kiwi skin
Voice of the hood, you rap niggas is CNN
28 grams on my Grandma's saucer
Heater on the waist, box cutter in the parka
Fiends at the door, Cold D up in lockup
Smokin' on ganja, sippin' java from Starbucks
Chillin' with chicken, roll gan out dey purses
Browntown served more niggas than churches
Die for your rhymes, then you wouldn't be worth shit
But to me it's real because I live my verses
No water in the house, underarm must
Puttin' water in the toilet just to make the fucker flush
I live too real for a movie
Smokin' gan same color as a coochie

Detroit. Streets. City. Broadcaster. Nigga

Ha!

// It's A Discription //

You was raised off welfare, nursing on focused hope
Pops left, young age, mom got her shoulder rope
Mom can't do that, mom's drunk off dope
Cold water bath, tic tac sized soaps
Sis' got pregnant, when she was young
Out here trickin' making you watch her son
Stolen cable BET stay on the screen
Never a dull moment, mom fight with other fiends
The happiest moment when you sleep and you dream
Then you wake up to the same old thing
Cereal no milk, dishes in the sink
Older brother runnin' 'round, gettin' money, wearing mink
Won't buy nothin' to eat, always buy drinks
Get the whole house drunk, then shit pop off
Momma boyfriend trippin' 'bout a dime got lost
Mind is lost, smoke a blunt, try to do (law?)
Seem fit to sell drugs, but you just too soft
Hard times at school because your peer is off
Too many roaches, might see a mouse
Extension cords get power from the neighbor's house
Got two pair of jeans, dead air, one's
Brother old coke square smoke in your lungs
The man of the house but your momma youngest son
Back to the wall, face to the wind
Ma's scratch the last of the number but don't win
Sister disappearing always leaving her kids
Tired of ramen noodles, you can see your ribs
Lot of sugar in the Kool-Aid keep your thirst quenched
Cigarettes and weed, make your eyes squint
Fridge empty, nothin' in the cabinet but spinach
And you ain't Popeye, livin' in a crowded house
Space heater keeps you warm, while you sleep on the couch
Bridge card every first, keep food in your mouth
Unless your mom sell 'em for drugs, and then you know
That month, shit gon' be fucked up
So you go to school, for the free lunch and stuff
But niggas teasing like you some type of punk and stuff
So you got kicked out for punching and stuff
Headaches at night, and your stomach is growling
Crack smoke in the air and the wolves is howling
...eviction notice on the door
...niggas sleepin' on the floor
...you can't take it no more
Just listen you can make it out
Just look at what's around you take a different route
If you don't have a dream, how could it come true?
Take a look at me, look what I've been through
It's a discription...

// Yo Lovin //

Yo Lovin...

Wish I could take you back to my younger days
Feet pajamas, oatmeal off the microwave
Way back when I used to watch cartoons
Now I just rock the same shit like cartoons
For the last buck with the chronic
I was supposed to be crib, fruit snacks and Sonic
Now I'm posted in the spot with sacks and Tonic
Serve the high school kids before home economics
With a mind full of money and a heart full of change
Gotcha nigga puffing loosies skip home, a thang
Don't take it as a diss if a nigga don't speak
It's just... a lot on my mind this week
Gave my nigga four years so I smoke more blunts
And the nigga that snitched got 36 months
... what goes around come back
Tryna make the beat cry put my life on the track
Sit in Champion hood, split a swisher down the middle
Nights in the snow, bloc high like acquittal
Got a get it, no matter what's the season
Missed my PO day gotta come up with a reason
My granny die, already used that fuck it
Let the dice know, sipping the henney straight back
Roll another sack gotta get my mind right
Hit the booth spit the truth like W. Cronkite
I'm a heavyweight, guns make you levitate
Bout to get the d back crackin' like '88
Phone was goin' on by Marvin
Cause niggas still hustlin' and starvin'

// Live Every Day //

Bitches in the kitchen, roaches in the cereal box
Front open but the screen don't lock
We just live everyday, we don't go no prob
Piss in the alleyway we ain't got no pot
The hook want us all, law harassing us daily
Pyrex pot still feed our babies
Crackhead moms sell dick for fixes
Forced to sell rocks, do two a rendition
Now a hundred, ninety-nine die in a million
Still hiding work in my grandma's ceiling
Old school stash in a crown royal bag
Thinking of the future cause the past is the past
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had
Pain in my heart cause my daughter miss her dad
Wanna get my life straight, give her what I never had
