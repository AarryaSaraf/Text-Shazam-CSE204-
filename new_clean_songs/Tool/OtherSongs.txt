// Calling Dr. Love //

You need my love baby, oh so bad 

You're not the only one I've ever had 

And if I say I wanna set you free 

Don't you know you'll be in misery 


They call me (Dr. Love) 

They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love) 

I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love) 


And even though I'm full of sin 

In the end you'll let me in 

You'll let me through, there's nothin' you can do 

You need my lovin', don't you know it's true 


So if you please get on your knees 

There are no bills, there are no fees 

Baby, I know what your problem is 

The first step of the cure is a kiss 


So call me (Dr. Love) 

They call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love) 

I am your doctor of love (calling Dr. Love), ha 

They call me (Dr. Love), they call me Dr. Love (calling Dr. Love)

I am the doctor of love (calling Dr. Love) 

I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love) 

Ooh, they Call me (Dr. Love)

I've got the cure you're thinkin' of (calling Dr. Love) [x4]

// Demon Cleaner //

I've got the demons within
I've got to brush them all away
I feel the demon's rage
I must clean them all away
Yeah, yeah...

Excite to scream them away
Cobwebs in the way
That magic cleaner oh
Shine his smile on me
Yeah, yeah...

I am the demon
Cleaner who saves the day
I get the backwall
And important they'll always stay
Yeah, yeah...

If only one thing that you know
Imposters from the show
They'll try to trick you into
Normal treatment
Oh don't you listen to them say
Shush them all away
I am the demon cleaner
Madman so
I am the freedom cleaner
Standing naked here to say
I'm the only way...

// Divorced //

Well there aren't any here yet.


See your name in lights: send them in!

[around 13:30 into the song, this conversation takes place]
[Buzz:] What about Ryan?
[Maynard:] No, he blew it, he lost the number for the girl he met down here.
[Buzz:] Oh, and Adam said she's a beauty. 
[Maynard:] She's the one who has that fucked up voice.
[Buzz:] Is she a rocket scientist?
[Maynard:] The fuckin'... she has a voice like a fuckin' modem dude!
[Buzz:] (Laughs) Sounds perfect!
[Maynard:] Immatates a chick with a voice like a modem sayin' some weird

gibberish... (You have to hear it)
[Buzz:] (Laughs heavely)
[Maynard:] Then he got to work up there, you know Ryan gets off at work, I

guess to show that he has a dick.
[Buzz:] (Laughs again)

// Muhammad My Friend //

Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world

We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem

And on that fateful day when she was crucified

She wore Shiseido Red and we drank tea by her side


Sweet, sweet, sweet

Used to be so sweet to me, well


Muhammad my friend, I'm getting very scared

Teach me how to love my brothers who don't know the law

And what about the deal on the flying trapeze?

Got a peanut butter hand, but honey

do drop in at the Dew Drop Inn


Sweet, sweet, sweet

Between the boys and the bees


Sweet, sweet, sweet

Between the boys and the bees


And Moses I know, I know you've seen fire

But you've never seen fire until you've seen Pele blow

And I've never seen light, but I sure have seen gold

And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine

till I get my own, honey, TV show


Ashre, ashre, ashre, ashre


And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave

I got a place in the Pope's, honey, rubber robe

Muhammad my friend, it's time to tell the world

We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem

// OpiateÂ² //

Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to use you
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me

If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you

My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you

Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now

If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do

Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you

My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you

// Revolution //

[Maynard:]

Living on the street shores

He didn't learn and wanted children

Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"

He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]

He didn't wanna deal with it

Here they come, feelings that come as natural

Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all

He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]

Running away, getting some kinda cure

"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

[Maynard:]

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Don't run away, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love...

[Zach screaming 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution
[Zach & Maynard screaming 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

[Zach:]

Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves

Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness

Suicide or a slower death from addiction

seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Maynard:] Running...

[Zach:]

Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves

Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness

Suicide or a slower death from addiction

seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Zach:]

Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Zach screaming 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution
[Zach & Maynard screaming 4x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

// Spasm //

My, Out of my mind 

My life, I 

My mind, out of my mind 

My life, I 


So confident so, self obsessed no 

Compromise no, self obsessed no 


My...mind, out of my mind 


As you stare into the water 

Are you scared you'll be forgotten 

As you stare into the water 


My, Out of my mind 

My life, I 

My mind, out of my mind 

My mind, I 


Compromise no, self obsessed no 

Compromise no, self obsessed so 

Compromise no, compromise so 

Compromise so, self obsessed 


As you stare into the tide 

Are you scared to be forgotten 

As you stare into the water 


Terrified...terrified...terrified to be forgotten [x4]

// Stranglehold //

Here I come again now, baby

Like a dog in heat

Tell it's me by the clamor now, baby

I like to tear up the street

And I been smokin' for so long

Ya know I'm here to stay

Got you in a stranglehold, baby

You best get outta the way


Road I cruise is a bitch now baby

But no, you can't turn me round

And if a house gets in my way, baby

Ya know I'm tearing it down

You ran the night that you left me

You put me in my place

I got you in a stranglehold, baby

Then I crushed your face.


Sometimes you wanna start higher

And sometimes you gotta start low

Some people think they gonna die someday

I got news, ya never got to go


C'mon, c'mon up...


C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon up

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon


Road I cruise is a bitch now

Ya know ya can't turn me round

And if a house gets in my way

Ya know I'm burnin' it down

Ya ran the night that you left me

You put me in my place

I got you in a stranglehold, baby

Then I crushed your face.
