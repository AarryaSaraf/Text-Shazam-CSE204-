// Sweet Sweet Jenny //

You're gonna leave me, you're gonna leave me
My sweet sweet Jenny
I told you that I love you and no one else
Now you're going, yes you're going to leave me all alone in pain

You're going to leave me
You're going to leave me, my sweet sweet Jenny

I know someday you will realize
What you did to me is wrong
I know someday you will understand
And want to come back to me
(Don't come back to me no more)

// My Destination //

Well, I feel in love with a girl on Sunday
Fell in love with my friend on Monday
My mind was worried, my heart was in trouble

He's her fascination
Her inspiration
And her destination

I was walking on a lonely road one Tuesday
I met a girl, she dates me on Wednesday

On Thursday, we were walking down the aisle
On Friday, we were feeling so fine

If it's not today, if it's not today...

She's my fascination
My inspiration
And my destination

// True Love //

Love is a habit
My true true love I found
A love that is bright as the moonlight
A love that so wide as the sun

Sometimes it makes me happy
Sometimes it makes me sorry
Sometimes I wanna get rid of it
The next time, I am rid of it

A love is like a gypsy
The true true true true love I prove
A love that is wide as the ocean
And deep deep deep deep as the sea

True true love

// Just Got To Be //

Darling if you ever say you're mine
Tender love and peace will be our drive

Hey can't you see
I love you with all my heart
Can you say you love me too?
And living together

Oh oh yeah
Just got to be that way

Hey little girl can't you see
I love you with all my heart
Can you say you love me too?
And living together

// Hallelujah //

Once I was bound
By the name of J-E-S-U-S
To V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
I am

My man, I call upon you
Because you look so very strong
To C-H-R-I-S-T
To Christ, we are bound to win

That's why I'm saying
Hallelujah

// Don't Let //

Don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you
You, darling, you are the apple of my eye
Baby let me tell you
You're really sweet like cherry pie
Yeah you got me spinning and I don't know what to do
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
Did anyone tell you that I've been seeing someone new
Baby let me tell you
Darling please don't don't you believe
If you just come to me our hearts will beat as one

So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
My darling, when I look into your face darling darling... All I can see
Baby let me tell you
Is pure teardrops falling from your eyes
I want you to understand that I love no one but you
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart

// Tell Me You Love Me //

Tell me, tell me, tell me... what's on your mind?
Tell me, my loved one tell me... what's on your mind?
You leave my home more and more
I never knew that you'd be hurt
Tell me, tell me... I've done you wrong

A lover like you because you understand
Especially you're going like your hairy man
I know no one in this world will do
'Cause, just because I have you my love
