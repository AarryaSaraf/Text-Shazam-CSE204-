// Got To Feel //

Got to, got to, got to

Sure I saw you walking down the lane with another boy
And I just turned my face away and I walked a little faster
When you see me walking down the street with another girl
You just fuss around and try to work all your tricks on me

I know you would do that
Oh baby, do that

That's the way you want it

Get me, get me feel it

If you see me walking down the street with another girl
You just bust around and try to work all your tricks on me
So I saw you walking down the lane with another boy
And I just turned my face away and I walked a little faster

// Feel So Good //

As I was walking on Orange Street, I feel so lonely
And shook up and shook up and shook up for a little love, yeah
And I walked, and I walked, and I walked and I just couldn't find
Couldn't find, couldn't find that little love, yeah afterwards I feel so good
Afterwards I find my lover, I feel so good afterwards

As I was walking on that street, I feel so lonely
And shook up, and shook up and shook up for a slice of bread, yeah
And Mr. Walker's bakery was the only bakery I could check on
I could check on, I could check on, I could check on for a slice of bread
Then I feel so good afterwards, oh yeah, I feel so good afterwards

As I was walking on Orange Street, I feel so lonely
And shook up, and shook up and shook up for a little love, yeah
And I walked, and I walked, and I walked and I talked, and I talked
'Til I find a little love, oh Lord and I feel so good afterwards, yeah
I feel so good afterwards, Lord

As I was walking on that street afterwards
Yeah, and I feel so good afterwards
Yeah, and I was walking on Orange Street
