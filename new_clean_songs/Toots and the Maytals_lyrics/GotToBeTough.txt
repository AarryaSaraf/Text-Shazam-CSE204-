// Drop Off Head //

If you fall, you can rise
Pick up yourself from off the ground
Sometimes your good friend let you down
Saying bad things about you
Just use it as a motivation
'Cause I know your expectation
Don't you prejudice against no Nation
I know what you anticipating

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
Sometime it fall on your shoulder (ugh!)
You got to cry a little louder
Don't call Crimson and Clover
Cause as you twitch your eye it will be over

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

If you fall, you can rise
Pick up yourself from off the ground
Sometimes your good friend let you down
Saying bad things about you
Just use it as a motivation
'Cause I know your expectation
Don't you prejudice against no Nation
I know what you anticipating

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
What fall off your head, fall on the ground (fall on the ground)
Sometime it fall on your shoulder (ugh!)
You got to cry a little louder
Don't call Crimson and Clover
Cause as you twitch your eye it will be over

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies get you down
Just try, try and try
Don't let the enemies win your Crown

// Just Brutal //

We were brought here, sold out
Victimized, brutally
Every time I keep remembering
What Grandfather said before he died
We were brought down here in slavery
Count out, knocked out, TKO
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

We need more love in our heart
Remember what the preacher said
He said "too much crazy things has been going on"
I don't know what this world is coming to
Hey, Churches against Churches
Preachers against preachers
Kingdom against Kingdom
I don't know what this world is coming to, hey

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

We were brought here, sold out
Victimized, brutally
Every time I keep remembering
What Grandfather said before he died
We were brought down here in slavery
Count out, knocked out, TKO
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

// Got To Be Tough //

Got to be tough when things get rough
You got to be tough and this is a warning
You got to be smart, living in this time
It's not so easy to carry on
So if you are my friend, treat me like a friend
A friend in need and a friend indeed

Just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Things may be hard, so hard
But we have to overcome it, yeah
When you lost someone like loved ones
We have to overcome it, yeah

But just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Got to be tough when things get rough
You got to be tough and this is a warning
You got to be smart, living in this time
It's not so easy to carry on
So if you are my friend, treat me like a friend
A friend in need and a friend indeed

But just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

// Warning Warning //

Let Decency counteract your dirty principles
That you possess, and be respectful
So that everyone can see
Why won't you utilize your brain
In the right way that you should
Well, if you don't change
I would assume that you would be doomed
Next to your tomb

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
Yes, I'm giving you a warning, warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

The way you moving now
That's not the way for a friend to move, no
If you don't change
I would assume that you would be doomed
Next to your tomb

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
I'm giving you a warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

// Good Thing That You Call //

It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us

It was a good thing when you call
A good thing when you call me
Really was a good thing when you call
So that we can talk things over now

I've been calling you night and day
Didn't you see my missed calls?
I've been texting you every time
Didn't you check your BP?

It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us

Sometimes you slip, sometimes you slide
Sometimes you caught up in a frame of mind
And you don't know the reason why
Our love will never die

I'm living in Kingston
I heard you living in Portmore
I heard you living in the Country
Why don't you come over and see me?

It's a good time that you call
It's a good time that you call me
Really it's a good time that you call
When no one else can listen to us
It was a good thing when you call

I've been calling you night and day
Didn't you see my missed calls?
I've been texting you every time
Didn't you check your BP?

It was a good thing when you call
A good thing when you call me
Really was a good thing when you call
So that we can talk things over now

It's a good time that you call
It's a good thing that you call me
Really it's a good time when you call
When no one else can listen to us

// Stand Accused //

I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies

And I wish if every day could be just like today
The morning is warm and bright
There is sunshine everywhere, uh uh
I know Good come out of Evil
And out of Evil come forth Good
Poor people need an helping hand
To help their children get an education

Well I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies

I know Good come out of Evil
And out of Evil come forth Good
Poor people need an helping hand
To help their children get an education

Well I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused, yea, since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies
I stand accused, yea

// Three Little Birds //

Say don't worry, don't worry 'bout a thing
I know every little thing gonna be alright

Wake up this morning, smile with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my door step
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, this is my message to you
(Come in, uncle Toots)

Well I say don't worry 'bout a thing

// Struggle //

In this struggle, poor people can't see their way
In this struggle, we need to cooperate
In this struggle world, we need to love
In this struggle, many try to fight me down

But I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

You say you love me, and then you hurt me
I can't believe those things you've been doing to me
You cheated me, you even accusing me
You done me wrong, fighting me so long

But I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

You said you love me, and then you hurt me
You're doing things much more destructively
Instead of been my friend, you become my biggest, most biggest enemy
Who to ever diggeth a pit, liable to fall in it, oh oh

Still I'm not gonna fight against them
That fight against I
And I'm not telling no lie
And if I should fight against you
The way you fight against me
There would be no peace

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it

We got to stop the fighting
The shooting and killing
We got to stop the fighting
Got to find a way to stop it
