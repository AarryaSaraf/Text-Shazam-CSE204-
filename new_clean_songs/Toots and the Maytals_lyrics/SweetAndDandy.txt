// Just Tell Me //

Just tell me that you really love me true
Then I will know just what to do
Just tell me that you're in love with me
Just tell me that you really love me true
Then I will know just what to do
Just tell me that you're in love with me
And I will know that you want me dilligently
There is nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you
There is nothing for you to pray to force me to do
Won't you tell me that you love me true
And I will know just what to do
Because I, I, I, I, I love you
Sing it again
La la la la la la la la la la

// Sweet & Dandy //

Alright!

Eh hey!
Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must, "wipe her eyes"
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Johnson in the room a fret
Uncle say he must, "hold up him head!"
Aunty say, "him nuh fi foolish like a nuh time fi him wedding day"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
Why they were dancing
In that ball room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
20 bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up inna white
Fi go eat out Johnson wedding cake

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must, "wipe her eyes"
Papa say, "she nuh fi foolish like she never been to school at all"

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing
In that ball room last night

Eh hey!
Johnson inna room a fret
Uncle say he must, "hold up him head!"
Aunty say, "him nuh fi foolish like a nuh time fi him wedding day"

One pound ten for the wedding cake
And 20 bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up inna white

It is no wonder
It's a perfect ponder
Why they were dancing
In that ball room last night
