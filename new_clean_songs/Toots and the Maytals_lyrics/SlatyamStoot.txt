// If You Act This Way //

If you act this way
You'll never be free
You don't know good
And you don't know good
Don't know good from bad

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
'Cause you can't see, see
See what you have done to me
You must remember you're the one
Who told me that you were true
So it's no use, stop you're crying
There is nothing more I can do, do, do

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
And you can't see, see
See what you have done to me

You must remember you're the one
Who told me that you were true
So it's no use, stop you're crying
There is nothing more I can do, do, do

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
And you can't see, see
See what you have done to me

If you act this way, way, way
You'll never be free

// Pomps And Pride //

Everybody just
Cryin out (cry out)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Calm down (calm down)

Have your pomps and pride
Everybody just

For today, today, today is a happy day
For tonight tonight, can be another night
Do re mi fah so la te do
Everybody's just crying crying
Sighing sighing
Dying to see the light
And when they see it, they see it's not bright
Can this be right?
Everybody just
Calm down (calm down)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Is it an opulin, Iceland, calm down [?]
Calm down
Have your pomps and pride
