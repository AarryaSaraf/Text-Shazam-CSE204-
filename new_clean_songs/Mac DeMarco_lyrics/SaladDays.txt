Album: SaladDays

// Salad Days //

As I'm getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die

[scat singing]

Missing hippy Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell 'em so long

[scat singing]

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

[scat singing]

Salad days are gone, missing hippy Jon
Remember the days just to tell 'em so long

[scat singing]

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year [x2]

// Blue Boy //

Blue boy, worried about the world's eyes
Worried every time the sun shines
Worried about his haircut
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue boy [x4]

Blue boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes
No use acting so tough
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue boy [x4]

// Brother //

You're no better off, living your life and dreaming at night
This much is true, but it's still up to you to take my advice

To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home [x4]

You're better off dead, when your mind's been set from nine until five
How could it be true, well it's happened to you, so take my advice

And take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home [x8]

// Let Her Go //

Tell her that you love her, if you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure, let her know

Growing by the hour, love just like a flower
But when the flower dies, you've got to say goodbye
And let her go

Let her go [x2]

Tell her that you'll be there, if you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to make the heart grow fond
But it don't

So tell her that you love her, if you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure, let her go

Let her go [x4]

Yeaaahh

[Scat singing]

// Goodbye Weekend //

Goodbye weekend, so long darling
Macky's been a bad bad boy
And when their preaching is sure to change me
Should rearrange me or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough, but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life,
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

Sort me, place me, give me a sign
Repeat the mantra when you're stepping out of line
Give me a number, something to be
May help out the country boy but it won't work out on me

[x2:]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

// Let My Baby Stay //

I was made to love her, been working at it
Half of my life, I've been an addict

And she's been good to me
Far as I can tell she's happy, livin' with her Macky

So please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

Please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

And where would I be, feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

And what's there left to say
Far as I can tell that day could be on its way

So please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

Please don't take my love away
Let my baby stay, let my baby stay

[scat singing]

// Passing Out Pieces //

Watching my life, passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story, or is it boring?
Can't claim to care, never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

Passing my life, living it out with her side
Listening closely, hearing her mostly
Can't shake concern, seems that every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me, don't you know nothing comes free?

What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

// Treat Her Better //

Hey man, heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be, judging by the way you treat her

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Hey man, who's been keeping brother
Hey man, how old is your mother

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now [x2]

[Guitar solo]

Treat her better, boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now [x2]

// Chamber Of Reflection //

Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again

Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run
With better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
It's within that brings that
Lonely feeling

Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear
Among the better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

// Go Easy //

Pack it up and leave it, leave it all behind you
Starting fresh in someone else's town
And though we may be leaving, I'll be right beside you
To pick you up until you come around

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

Honey it can be tough, without your friends beside you
You built it up, just to knock it down
So when you're feeling rough, I'll be right behind you
To pick you up until you come around

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy [x2]
