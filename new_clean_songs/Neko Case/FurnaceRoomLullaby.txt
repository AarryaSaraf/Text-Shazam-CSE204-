// Set Out Running //

Want to get it all behind me

You know everything reminds me

I can't be myself without you

Want to crawl down deep inside

The springs inside the mattress

Where l cry my dirty secrets

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

Past the city houses

And the ditches on the highway

Read between the seasons

Under the bridges in valleys

Til the winds out on the prairie

Whip the tears from my eyes


Want to get it all behind me

You know everything reminds me

I can't be myself without you

Want to crawl down deep inside

the springs inside the mattress where I cry my dirty secrets

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

Across the muddy river

And the smokestacks on the bank

Swallow that horizon

Hunger beyond hunger

Til the cloudy blue Pacific

Took the air in my lungs


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes.

// Guided By Wire //

Voices that did comfort me

Are furthest from my sanity

And come from places I have never seen

Even in my darkest recollection

There was singin' my life back to me


The life you learn from someone else

That you can only trust yourself

Sometimes that is still too much to want


Gravity won't get you through the mazes

You can never travel by the way you've come


I could never choose the ones to love

And the ones who took the credit left me reelin'

But I owe much to the nameless and all those surrogates

Those who're singin' my life back to me


Life is not a constant thing

It's only made of short stories

I couldn't even tell you where I'm from

Guided by the voices I've deflected

Guided by electric wires' hum


I could never choose the ones to love

And the ones who took the credit left me reelin'

But I owe much to the nameless

Those who're singin' my life back to me


I see you in the future, skippin' time

While the eyes of all the faithful rest in peace

Yet tonight I see the highway

And someone singin' my life back to me

// Porchlight //

So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away


Days have gone by and I've barely gone

Safe on the road that speeds from your front door

I can't turn around 'cause I long to be forgiven


It hangs in my hair and the hems of my clothes

I thought in the madness my arms could not hold

I can't tell you why 'cause I long to be forgiven


So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away


I'm sorry to tread on your patience, my dear

My heart might be willing by this time next year

I can't make you wait 'cause I long to be forgiven


So far away

Curses wild upon you

Hungry and gaining

Porchlight burns so far away

Miles away

// Mood To Burn Bridges //

So many people live in my town

And mind to my business but none of their own

They're all so happy now that I've done wrong

I'm surprised they don't come up and thank me


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day, baby


Don't make mistakes or be human

They savor your every false move

And the fear that they hide looking for a Break

If ever confronted with truth


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day, baby


From the well of their hearts spring the poison

That mixed with suspicion and reckless derision

And something they read on a church toilet stall

They think that their lives are much better

Than mine on the soapbox and ladders stand tall


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day


I see those arrows beside me

I hear you right behind me

Don't cross me on neither a day

// No Need To Cry //

Lie in bed and ignore the TV

Watch the clouds sift through the aero

And you'll be in my arms again

There's no need to cry


Of all the things so bittersweet

You're the first thing I see in morning and in sleep

And you'll be in my arms again

There's no need to cry


Years have been lost but can never be replaced

But my thoughts are with you

Tied to that interstate

And you'll be in my arms tonight


There's no need to cry

There's no need to cry

There's no need to cry

// Twist The Knife //

Tenderly
Tenderly
Please take my breath from me
Into the fountain
And up from the graves

Tearfully
Joyfully
Burn what is left of me
I don't want these burdens
I've handsomely gained 

You'll be my guest
And I'll let you stay
Leave me the check
I'll pay with the rest of my life
Twist the knife

Carefully
Quietly
You took what's young from me
I didn't deserve it
I gave it away

Cowardly
Thoughtlessly
You walk away from me
And I'll tear my heart out to save you the day

You'll be my guest
And I'll let you stay
Leave me the check
I'll pay with the rest of my life
Twist the knife

Tenderly
Tenderly
Please take my breath from me
Into the fountain
And up from the graves

// Thrice All American //

I want to tell you about my hometown

It's a dusty old jewel in the South Puget Sound

Well the factories churn and the timbers all cut down

And life goes by slow in Tacoma


People they laugh when they hear you're from my town

They say it's a sour and used up all place

I defended its honor, shrugged off the put downs

You know that you're poor, from Tacoma


Buildings are empty like ghettos or ghost-towns

It gives me a chill to think what was inside

I can't seem to fathom the dark of my history

I invented my own in Tacoma


There was nothing to put me in love with the good life

I'm in league with the the gangs guns, and the crime

There was no hollow promise that life would reward you

There was nowhere to hide in Tacoma


People who built it they loved it like I do

There was hope in the trainyard of something inspired

Once was I on it, but it's been painted shut

I found passion for life in Tacoma


Well I don't make it home much, I sadly neglect you

But that's how you like it away from the world

God bless California, make way for the Wal-Mart

I hope they don't find you Tacoma

// We've Never Met //

Oh my darling, oh my darling

How can you forget?

All the love we had between us

Now it's like we've never met


Oh it kills me, how it kills me

When I think I held you up

You were golden, I was blind

With your poison in my blood


Bittersweet are the memories

That make old lovers pine

But I'll trade all the memories

Just to have your heart in mine


Everybody's talking to me

But they just can't explain

Disappeared from all the pages

And nothing seems the same


Was a time I thought I knew you

When I looked you in the eye

Now the same eyes look right through me

You're too cool to see me cry


Bittersweet are the memories

That make old lovers pine

But I'll trade all the memories

Just to have your heart in mine


Oh my darling, oh my darling

How can you forget

All the love we had between us

Now it's like we've never met


You were golden and I was blind

Now it's like we've never met

// Whip The Blankets //

Well it's hot in the yard

And it's cool in the bed

And I whip the blankets into cotton thread

And I'll tear all the carpet up over my head

'Til my feet can go right through the basement


Well you play so surprised at what you have found

But I heard you coming from way across town

So let's get to getting to burning it down

And the fire, it's spreading like madness


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start


When the dishes are broken and the kitchen's a mess

I'm trapped in the door

Why don't you make me confess

'Cause I'm tastin' delicious

To just keep you guessin'

Whatever it is, that ignites me


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start


When instinct is dirty and morality's clean

And we're bound for damnation say those magazines

Well to hell with the sorrow and watered-down scenes

We'll burn us a bridge straight to heaven.


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start

// South Tacoma Way //

I put on that sweater you gave me

I woke up in the kitchen a few minutes later

I didn't know how I had gotten there

Did you guide me

I didn't make it to your funeral

I didn't want ritual nor resign

I just wanted to hold hands with

J.P and Mary-Jo

But I couldn't conjure tears

We're too good for stupid angels

Blackness held its breath beside me

And burned the air till it was gone

Till it was gone

Till it was gone


Couldn't pay my respects to a dead man

Your life was much more to me

And I chased away with sticks and stones

But that rage kept following me

Following Me

Following Me

So lost I was asleep in the palms of your hand

In dreams we were happy and safe

I can't comprehend the ways I miss you

They come to light in my mistakes

In my mistakes

In my mistakes

Now I'm travelling down Tacoma way

And the world turns in slow motion

It's the twilight of our old home

And I'm still in love with you

Oh here on South Tacoma way

We've memories for matinees

And the tears come warm and heavy

And the cross streets bare your name

And the cross streets bare your name

// Bought And Sold //

Lost love

You're the one that lies in my arms

You're the one that stole all my charms

I let you in


Misery

You took everything young from me

Burned it down right in front of me

My blood runs cold


Nobody said that love was gonna be kind

But they did say that it was pleasurable as it was divine


Lost love

You're the one that lies in my arms

You're the one that stole all my charms

I'm bought and sold


Nobody said that love was gonna be kind

But they did say it was pleasurable as it was divine


Wish I could leave it behind

Lost love

// Furnace Room Lullaby //

All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


I twisted you over and under to take you

The coals went so wild as they swallowed the rest

I twisted you under and under to break you

I just couldn't breathe with your throne on my chest


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


So far under the bed

Into the beams you've gone

I've gone, you've gone


I'm wrapped in the depths of these deeds that have made me

I can't bring a sound from my head though I try

I can't seem to find my way up from the basement

A demon holds my place on earth 'till I die


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


So far under the bed

Into the beams you've gone

I've gone, you've gone


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart
