// Rivers Of Babylon //

By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remembered Zion

'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

Sing it out loud
Sing a song of freedom, brother
Sing a song of freedom, sister

So, let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight
Oh, Fari

So, let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight
Oh, Fari

We got to sing it together
Everyone
La la la la la

By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remembered Zion

'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

// Johnny Too Bad //

Walking down the road
With your pistol in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

Walking down the road
With your ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

One of these days
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock

Walking down the road
With a pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad

Walking down the road
With a ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing and you're looting and you're shooting
Now you're too bad

One of these days 
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

One of these days 
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock

// Sitting In Limbo //

Sitting here in limbo
But I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo
Like a bird without a song
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll
Yeah, now, sitting here in limbo
Got some time to search my soul
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will leave me
But I know where I have been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I have seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is past and gone
This little boy is movin' on

Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo
Knowing that I have to go
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will take me
But I know where I have been
I don't know what life will show me
But I know what I have seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
That is past and gone
And now it's time to move along

Gonna lead me on now
Meanwhile, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
