// I Walk The Line //

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind because you're mine I walk the line

I find it very very easy to be true I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you because you're mine I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side you give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide because you're mine I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right because you're mine I walk the line

// Life To Go //

I've got a sad, sad story friends, that I I don't like to tell
I had a home and family, when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years that's a long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me 'cause I've got life to go.

I went one night where the lights were bright to see what I could see
I met up with an old friend there, who's thought the world of me
He brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
But words were said and now he's dead, I just had to bring him down.

It has been a long time now since I've heard from my wife
I guess I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go.

I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
Yes, I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go.

Yes, I've still got life to go.
Yes, I've still got life to go...

// Heartaches By The Numbers //

Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Ev'ryday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Ev'ryday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

// I Love You Because //

I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I tried to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you.

No matter what the world may say, about you
I know your love will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide.

No matter what
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

// If You Got The Money (I Got The Time) //

If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the night spots, dance, drink beer and dine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time.

There ain't no use to tarry so let's start out tonight
We'll spread joy, oh boy, oh boy, and we'll spread it right
We'll have more fun, baby, all way down the line
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time.

If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along you cadillac, leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time.

Yes, we'll go honky tonkin' make every club in town
We'll go to the park when it's dark, we won't fool around
But if you run short of money, well, I'll run short of time
'Cause you with no more money, honey, I've no more time.

If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along you cadillac, leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time...

// Poor Man's Riches //

I've traveled to the ends of the rainbow
And I've looked for that old pot of gold
But I didn't realize until I looked into your eyes
That I had a greater wealth than ever told

Into each life there's many kinds of riches
There's diamonds, there's pearls and there's gold
But I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold

A true love is the greatest of all riches
A true love will never grow cold
A real love is all that really matters
For it's worth more than diamonds, pearls and gold

Into each life there's many kinds of riches
There's diamonds, there's pearls and there's gold
But I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold

I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold...

// If You Want Me To //

Well, there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I never have seen a river that's too wide

There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't nobody big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side.

So love me if you ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
No there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze strong enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side.

Well, there ain't no rope strong enough to bind me
Look for me honey you will find me
Any old time you're ready with your charms

Yeah I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitation
I'll be right there if you ever want me in your arms.

So love me if you ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
No there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze strong enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side...

// Oh, Lonesome Me //

Everybody is going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free
Oh, lonesome me.

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me.

Well, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all of her charms
Yeah, but I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find me somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me.

Well, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all of her charms
Yeah, but I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here, in my arms.

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find me somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me.

Oh, lonesome me.
Oh, lonesome me.
Oh, lonesome me...

// Just One More //

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay by till I'm not able
To see your face in everyplace that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another

I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why I sit and cry everyday
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay by till I'm not able
To see your face in everyplace that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another

// It's Been So Long Darling //

It's been so long darling since I had to go away
It's been so long darling and I can't forget that day
Although you never mentioned it you cried that whole day long
It's been so long darling but now I'm coming home.

It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling do you really realize
That got the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you.

It's been such a long time darling but it won't be long now
It's been so long darling but I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waiting as you did in days gone by
It's been such a long time darling please don't blame me if I cry...
