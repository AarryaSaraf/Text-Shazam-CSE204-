Album: ICanHearTheHeartBeatingAsOne

// Moby Octopad //

Locked in a kiss, outside eyes cease to exist
We'll shut it out (of the fist)
Spying eyes cease to exist
We'll shut it out

Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say
Dozing off the TV drones
House key makes them turn and glance for home

Locked in a kiss, outside eyes cease to exist
Flayed of the fist
Spiders cease to exist
We'll shut it out

// Sugarcube //

Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
From a sugarcube

Try to be more assured
Try to be more right there
Try to be less uptight
Try to be more aware

Whatever you want from me
Is what I want to do for you
Sweeter than a drop of blood
On a sugarcube

And though I like to act the part of being tough
I crumble like a sugarcube for you

Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I will try

Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
Squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcube

// Damage //

Nothing much Friday night
Pinball, the Lower East Side
Walked out of the past and into the bar

I used to think about you all the time
I would think about you all the time
Now it just feels weird that there you are

The damage is done

I feel like a kid again
My eyes are glued to the floor
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door

The damage is done
The damage is done

// Shadows //

Scold me, that's all you've got to say
Coldly hurt me and turn away
You say I'm not sorry that
I'm resolved to what is next
I head for the shadows

Hold me, taking it back in tears
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears
But I've got myself to protect
It's too soon for me to forget
I wait in the shadows

In the shadows, where I end up loved
They help me see that I've finally won
We wait in your heart

So until I truly believe
That your words convey what you mean
I wait in the shadows
I wait in the shadows
I don't mind the shadows

// Stockholm Syndrome //

What's the matter, why don't you answer
What's the matter with me
Cause it's so hard to be
Free and easy, we'll disappear completely
Hardly as I've known it's glad

Your heart is broken, and the doors are open
As you're hoping to be
There's brighter places to see
Hands need warming, early in the morning
Hardly as I've known a surprise

No, don't warn me I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't take long
And I know, you know it makes me sigh
I do believe in love

Another season, but the same old feelings
Another reason to be
I'm tired of aching, summer's what you make it
But I'll believe what I want to believe

// Autumn Sweater //

When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off

We could slip away, wouldn't that be better
Me with nothing to say, and you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always
But it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning...

// Little Honda //

I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're going down to the auto shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Get on the ride, no sweat, sure we'll take you anywhere you want me to

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, hang on tight
Third gear, ain't I right
Faster, it's all right

It's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride
We'll go on into the hills or anywhere you wanna decide

We'll ride some hills like a champ because my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turn, lean with me, hang on tight
I think I'll put on the lights, so I can ride mine under the night

// One PM Again //

Well, it's 1 PM again,
I guess I'm ready to begin,
And it's reeling, there is a feeling,
Let's not make any sudden moves.

You don't have to show me how,
But I'm not ready to right now,
There is a feeling, and it's reeling,
Let's not make any sudden moves.

And if we don't leave today,
There's no hurry anyway,
I'm on the road here, safe at home here,
So let's make sure we're sure,
That it is reeling, and I'm feeling,
Let's not make any sudden moves.

// The Lie And How We Told It //

Talking words, angry words
Hang in the air, we don't dare
Sky went gray, wake in white
Hangs in the air, we don't dare

And there's a thousand reasons
I don't need them to help the fired flare
And even as we near it, I can't hear it
Files in the air
We don't dare

// Center Of Gravity //

In crowded bars, at subway cars

Whenever you are next to me,
center of gravity,
can't feel both feet on the ground

Walking home after dark, past the softball park

It's clear to me, according to a rule I learned one day in school
Basic geometry: two halves of a circle, you and me

It's a familial song we've known so long

Your clever cuts into me
as long as you're next to me
I can't feel both feet on the ground

// We're An American Band //

Driving in the south, the motor's on fire
Let's put it out, before the flames go higher

Monday matinee, 'Big Bully' or 'White Squall'
So hard to choose, wish we could see them all

Some college in the spring, the sound is all wrong
We set the mains to our favorite Hootie song

Driving (not again), an 8 car crash
We'll turn to look unless we're going too fast

// My Little Corner Of The World //

Come along with me to my little corner of the world
Dream a little dream in my little corner of the world
You'll soon forget that there's any other place
Tonight, my love, we'll share a sweet embrace

And if you care to stay in my little corner of the world
We could hide away in my little corner of the world
I always knew that I'd find someone like you
So welcome to my little corner of the world

And if you care to stay in our little corner of the world
We could hide away in our little corner of the world
We always knew that we'd find someone like you
So welcome to our little corner of the world
