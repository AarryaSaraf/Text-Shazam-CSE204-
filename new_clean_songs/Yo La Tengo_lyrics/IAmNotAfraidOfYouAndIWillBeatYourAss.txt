Album: IAmNotAfraidOfYouAndIWillBeatYourAss

// Pass The Hatchet, I Think I'm Goodkind //

Unplug the microphone
The ticker tape scream
They're all desensitized
Grown so backwards
Crush a [?]
Well it's slide slide slide
Down the water slide
Slide slide slide
Down the water slide

Unplug the microscope
The ticker tape stream
[?]
It's easy to be quiet
But harder than it seems
While I slide slide
Down the water slide
Slide slide slide
Down the water slide

Unplug the microphone
The ticker tape screams
Then I burst through
On a sound attack
Can't see for miles
Can't see the pavement for the street
Well it's slide slide slide
Down the water slide
Slide slide slide
Down the water slide

Slide
Slide
Slide

// Beanbag Chair //

I've spent my life trying to understand
Just how my life lead to where I am
But it leaves a bitter taste
And it feels like such a waste

I am so totally vague
Betray the dark line, see if I care
I loved you when I was young but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

Memory plays its tricks on me
In my mind's eye I claim to see
I'm losing every race I run
Making misery out of fun

So bulldoze the new road
They're driving, slash the beanbag chair
You held me for so very long but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

All those types of things we think we need
But that doesn't make them true
I'm a little afraid I'm falling far and free
I'll leave that up to you

That's up to you

So won't you find me totally vague
A dream has died, see if I care
I loved you when I was young but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

Fireman's fair
Burn down the fireman's fair
Fireman's fair
Burn down the fireman's fair

// I Feel Like Going Home //

He calls me to the ocean
Takes me wandering through the street
A restless imagination
But for now I move my feet on the ground

'Cause I feel like going home

I can float above the ceiling
I like drifting through the air
I tend to lose my concentration
But right now the clouds don't appeal too much

I feel like going home

Sometimes late at night while running from the rain
Running from the voices filling up my brain
Now I wish they'd leave me alone
And let me be, to go off on my own

Let me be to go home
I feel like going home

// Mr. Tough //

Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dance floor
When it's time to talk tough?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
We'll leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a great big pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Hey Mrs. Blue
Time to think of something new
Please pause from spinning those hips
To the old soft shoe

And if you wanna last the rest of the night
There's nothing better I have to do
And if I tell you something
You won't have to ask if it's true

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
We'll leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a heaping pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Alone and uptight on Saturday night
And in my room
I'm hiding at a crowded party
The record's playing for just me and you

Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dance floor
When it's time to talk tough?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems if only for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner, leave them in a heaping pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alright

// Black Flowers //

You can take what you can get
I forgive but I forget
You can never sleep enough
And your alarm is going off

You wake up and you can't pretend a dream was just a dream again
Won't you dry your eyes?
But it doesn't matter anymore, you did just what you did before
Until you realize the words go la la la la la

You can dip your brain in joy
When you find the real McCoy

When some pretty boys with skinny ties, black flowers and Valentines
Try to take you home
Do you recognize that I have stopped before you get too high
On your own supply, singing la la la la

You want it, you got it, but you can't take it home
You've got a long way to go
I wait forever to say that you will
You have a heart to show

Honey, you don't have to stay inside, don't have to run, don't have to hide
Come and dry your eyes
You know you can always change your mind, maybe I will too in time
Once we understand no one understands at all

Singing la la la la
Singing la la la la

// The Race Is On Again //

We were young
No one could figure out
Things we said
There was so much to laugh about

Now at the end of the day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Just last night
I couldn't sleep at all
Lost my mind
Lost my footing scaling the wall

Now at the break of day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Now at the end of the day
Wish I could hear you say
We're at the starting gate
And the race is on again

Now at the end of the day
Wish you would say
And the race is on again

What am I doing now?
What am I doing now?
What am I doing wrong?

Will you wait for me?
Or will you run away?
I swear that I knew yesterday
Yesterday

What am I doing now?
What am I doing wrong?

Will you wait for me?
Or will you run away?
I swear that I knew yesterday
Yesterday

// The Room Got Heavy //

The room got heavy with a lamppost looming
We were driving in a circle somewhere near the station
Shoot me near the bushes, my eyes aren't focused
And we passed one parsing through the tunnel

Palisades Park, summer after dark
Hand holding fast to a party invitation
And the room got heavy but only for a minute
While everyone was waiting for you

The room got heavy, all the concrete in the air
And the couple around the corner at the yellow light blinking
She said "I wouldn't do that" but we all know that she did
From the look on her face, her arms slightly folded

And he headed for the door, reach across the floor
Hands in my pocket, my eyes aren't focused
And the room got heavy but only for a minute
While everyone waited for you

// Sometimes I Don't Get You //

Sometimes I don't get you
It's like an endless night
All I do is a waste
And the look on your face is like a knife
Am I fooling myself making believe
Together as one happily
Sometimes I don't get you
And I never lie

Sometimes I don't know you
It's like we never met
And what seems fine by me
Is your litany of regrets
Am I'm clinging to something that's passed
That was never intended to last
Sometimes I don't know you
Messes with my head

Sometimes I think I don't know
How to be on my own
Sometimes I won't answer the door
Or talk on the phone
With you by my side
I don't have to hide
The twig needs a trunk
So that it can continue to grow

The twig needs a trunk
So that it can continue to grow

Sometimes I don't get you
It's like I'm lost at sea
But then you say you're okay
And I know that you'll stay with me
Though it never comes soon enough
We'll get through the difficult stuff
No matter what we do
I'll be there for you
And maybe I'll get you
And you'll get me

// I Should Have Known Better //

I got in a tussle
With a stranger on the train
His face was familiar
But I couldn't place the name
It got to be ugly
Threats were made
I hope that no-one who could see
Would be someone who'd know you

I had a small run-in
With a driver and his wife
You might call it road rage
But the guy outdid the light
Considered nothing
I held my ground
And now that it's over
I've said that there must be
A better way

I keep it in mind
Eight times out of nine
I'm wrong or I'm right
It's not worth a fight
But what's hard to define
Makes it tough to decide
You don't realize
Until after it has begun
Whether this is the one
I probably knew better
I probably knew better

Consider nothing
I held my ground
And now that it's over
I'll say that there must be
A better way

I keep it in mind
Eight times out of nine
I'm wrong or I'm right
It's not worth a fight
But what's hard to abide
It's tough to decide
We don't realize
Until after it has begun
Whether this was the one
I probably knew better
I probably knew better
I probably knew better
I probably knew better

// The Weakest Part //

Stars will fall from the sky
And daylight will realise
Your pain would subside
If not for the weakest part
Of your heart

Bells ring out endlessly
Seem hard to ignore
But you, like a fool,
Just don't see
It preys on the weakest part
Of your heart

Some sunny day
The wind will come along
And scatter the dusty sleep
And you'll open your eyes

Stars could fall right out of the sky
If not for the weakest part
Bells will ring til the end of time
If not for the weakest part
Someday soon it'll be alright

// Song For Mahila //

Six for the frightened child
On the day we die
Five for the search for meaning
In the tears we cry
Le lie le lie
Tonight

Four from the shadows
Hiding just out of sight
Three for the disappearance
In the morning light
Le light le light
Tearing your arms to hold you tight
Tonight

One for the kiss
Before we say goodbye
Six for the frightened child
On the day we die
The light, the light
Tonight, tonight

// Point And Shoot //

One of these days
I'm gonna get myself a gun (ahh)
I might just shoot you down (ahh)
We know sometimes justice moves too slow
I'll be the judge, give it a gentle nudge

Don't want to live my life
Compassionate and humane (ahh)
It doesn't hurt to dream (ahh)
For some, love and justice never come
But the blind and both can be unkind

(ahh) love is in the air
Nobody's love is blue (ahh)
All you need is love (ahh)
And to our friends
Thinking of you as we look ahead
And to all the people
That we want dead (ahh)

// The Story Of Yo La Tango //

We stared at the sun, too long
until the shapes before our eyes
turned into the sun, in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
in our usual style
I wish we could ride 
To ourselves again

We made up our minds 
to lose and never once looked back
We only looked back
just once
We opened our hearts, it's true
But not to any of you
Sold out of the myth
too soon

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

We stared at the road ahead
Closed our eyes and then
sped up to the turn, around the bend
With nothing to lose, we lost
Suffered every cost
It still causes pain to calm

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
And we ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard

Refused to let go
of the air
There was something there
Sparks foam with gold
A million strong
and match forever lights in a row
I'm still flushed from the glow
I'm down on the road
back home
We stared at the sun, too long
until the shapes before our eyes turned back into the sun, into the sun in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
in our usual style
Now I wish we could ride, we wish we could lie to ourselves again
And we tried, we tried, we tried with all our might
we tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong, headlong in our way...
we tried so hard...
we tried so hard...
yeah we tried so hard...
