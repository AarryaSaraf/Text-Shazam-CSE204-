// Drug Test //

You may have left your mistake with breakfast
Watching the sun go down
I've been lying awake till dawn now
I'm not ready to face that
I'm not ready to face that thing today

I wish I was high
Brighter than nothing
Smarter than nobody
I've wasted away

I think of the things that matter
And I think of the things that don't
Whatever it is no matter
I hate feeling the way I feel
I hate feeling the way I eel today

I wish I was high
Brighter than nothing
Smarter than nobody
I've wasted away

I see myself with headphones on
I'm listening to Wake of the Flood [x2]
now I'm high

I wish I was high
Brighter than nothing
Smarter than nobody
I've wasted away
I wish I was high
Brighter than nothing
Smarter than nobody
I've wasted away

// The Evil That Men Do (Craig's Version) //

It's a lot of time
It's a lot of time
For a man who walks on me
For a man who walks on me

That's the way it is
That's the way it is
When a man walks on me
When a man walks on me

// Orange Song //

Wrote a sentence down, thought it out
I've pasted it on my walls
It's a sentence I can live with
And it goes like this
Oh, ah, oh, oh
After I looked at it
In my sleep, in my sleep
I bought a bag of oranges
With a bag of oranges
I planted oranges all over my bed
Well I'm trying to bite
And I often drink
I'm trying to bite one for a drink
I peel an orange
It's something I can't live with [x7]

// Alyda //

Came the day you made your mind to put you down
Raised your voice and found it made a stronger sound

Alyda, what have you done to you

Did confusion make you act that self assured
To take the step that you were not yet ready for

Alyda, what have you done to you

While you whiled away the hour
Do you still the way i knew
Do you dream of something better
Or just something else to do

He said how you hopped until your feet grew corns
Check for some reaction then just hop some more

Alyda, Alyda, Alyda - what have you done to you, to you, to you

// The Evil That Men Do (Pablo's Version) //

It's a lot of time
It's a lot of time
For a man who walks on me
For a man who walks on me

That's the way it is
That's the way it is
When a man walks on me
When a man walks on me

// I Threw It All Away //

I once held her in my arms
She said she would always stay
But I was cruel and treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

One side's mountains in the palm of my hand
Rivers that ran through everyday
Now I must've been mad or I never knew what i had
I threw it all away

Love is all there is
And it makes the world go round
Love and only love it can't be denied
No matter what you think about it
You won't be able to live without it
Take a tip from one who's tried

So if you find someone
Who gives you all of their love
Take it to your heart
Don't let it stray
Because one thing is for certain
You'll surely be hurting
if you thow it all away
just don't throw it all away
