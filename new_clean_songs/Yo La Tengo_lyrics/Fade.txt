Album: Fade

// Ohm //

Sometimes the bad guys come out on top
Sometimes the good guys lose
We try not to lose our hearts, not to lose our minds

Sometimes the bad days maintain their grip
Sometimes the good days fade
But the rain today hurts the head to dream

But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The higher we go, the longer we fly

'Cause this is it for all we know
So say goodnight to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow

I heard you calling from far away
I thought I heard you cry
Having the voice to make it right
So I just cry

I felt her slipping, slipping away
Before I could even see
Tried once more, lost my grip, you were gone

But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The longer it takes, the looser the ties

'Cause this is it for all we know
So say goodnight to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo dood doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The stronger the wind, the faster we'll fly

'Cause this is it for all we know
So say goodnight to me
And lose no more time
No time

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow

// Is That Enough //

Things we did unthinking
The joke we left unsaid
Unsure how and when we were misled

And if that matters
It's to very few
And all that matters
For me is you

Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's unclear the way I feel for you

I wonder if you're sleeping
I wonder how you know
I wonder why I hate to let that show

It's unimportant
As far as I can tell
What's important
I can't see so well

Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's unclear the way I feel for you

It's true
What can't come back's what we can't bear to lose

I'm getting smarter
Nearly everyday
Waiting, waiting
To see my way

Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
There's just no way that it's enough

Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's still unclear, the way I feel for you

It's sad but not untrue
What can't come back's what we can't bear to lose

// Well You Better //

Heard your voice in my head too soon
Pass girl, say it, it all cocoon
Oh baby, make up your mind
Please make up your mind

So we left a stone unturned 
Maybe that's a lesson learned, yeah
Please make up your mind before it's too late

I didn't wish you'd turn that much
That's where I draw the line as such
Oh baby, make up your mind
Please make up your mind

There's always more to see
But it'll keep go another day hard
Baby, make up your mind before it's too late

We got out of line
It all worked out this time
And everything's fine now
Please make up your mind
Please make up your mind

But if it's up, it's up to me
I'm not sure that I'll come see, yeah
You better make up your mind before it's too late
Baby, make up your mind 'fore it's too late
You better make up your mind 'fore it's too late

Baby, make up your mind 
Baby, make up your mind
Oh baby, make up your mind 'fore it's too late

// Paddle Forward //

It's on my list, we've come undone
Grip tight point, over away from the shore
We feel safe inside, but not a wave in sight
Hello tide, the water's warm

After that we've come undone
Slipped again, lost at sea, cracking synagogue
But we could stand for now this warm is coming as
Hello tide

Once it's far too fast
Never seems to last
Hang in tight when you form this

Shoot with force, we've come undone
Riptide pourin', pourin' on in from the shore
We feel safe inside, but not a wave in sight
Hello tide, there's still time
The water's fine

// Stupid Things //

Every stupid thing that happens to you
Every silly thing I say
Days just fade away
Slide into grey

Every little thing just creeps up on you
A bumpy road
Happens every day
And it takes my breath away

Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mine

Living with the time that holds us down but
How can that be sung
Where does that time go before our eyes

Every stupid thing that happens to you
The silly things I say
Not so hard to see
But it seems so out of reach

Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mine

Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mine

// I'll Be Around //

When I stare into space
I'm looking for you
And I can see you
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around

See the kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
She's looking my way
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around

Washing the dirt from your face
I'm looking for you
And I still miss you
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around

// Cornelia And Jane //

I hear the whispering
Just out of view
Still unknown
What's inside of you

Outside your window
Neighbors peer in at you
How can we care for you?
How can we hold onto you?

Caught up in motion
Swirling around
Sometimes you're standing still
On uneven ground

Too many sirens
They keep you up at night
Sit back and hold your ears
How will we hold back your tears?

I hear them whispering
They analyze
But no one knows
What's lost in your eyes

Sending the message
It doesn't get to you
How can we care for you?

Slipping away
Fade deep inside of you
But how can we hold on to you?

// Two Trains //

Black on white
The background chess
You're racing time
Retracing steps
When are you coming to town?

Before the fall
Before the flood
After the sinking feeling and the final cut
What are you going to do?
We're all waiting for you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Outbound train is always late
We stay lost inside our day
Inbound train, engine blows
Approaches home, never slows

Outbound train is flashing red
We stay lost inside our head
Inbound train, engine blows
Approaches home, never slows

What are you going to do?
We're all waiting for you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

// The Point Of It //

When you're screaming in my head
What's the point of it?
When you're sure no one will here
Or nothing you'll remain

Say that we're afraid
Say that we would run
Maybe that's okay
If we're not so strong
That's the point of it

When you choose to hide your eyes
Take me out of here
Find the comfort in my life
Before it disappears

Say that we're afraid
Say that we're not the ones
Maybe that's okay
If we're not so young
That's the point of it

When I'm standing next to you
That's the point of it
When you still run by us too
That's the point of it

Say that we're afraid
Say the night is close
Honey, that's okay
If we're getting old
If we're not so strong
If our story's told
That's the point of being born

// Before We Run //

Hold it in your arms
Be still, be there
I'll hold you in mine
Before we run, we can start to sing

I know it's hard
Believing in all of this
And then we run
Running away from here
Running away from here
Running away to stay

Orange clouds before the sky rolls back
Before we lose our earth
Before we escape
Cross the dotted line

Too fast and wise
Slowly like the storm
Be still, be there
Running away from there
Running away from there
Running until we're there

Take me to the place, the lonely place
Take me out beyond the stress
Speak to me words we can't erase
Take me there, it's only us
