Album: Painful

// Big Day Coming //

Let's be undecided
Let's take our time
And sooner or later
We will know our mind

We'll be on the outside
We won't care
'Cause we're together
That's somewhere

And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait

Let's wake up the neighbors
Let's turn up our amps
The way that we used to
Without a plan

We can play a Stones song
Sitting on a fence
And it'll sound pretty good
'Til I forget how it ends

And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait

I woke up early
Couldn't go back to sleep
'Cause I'd been thinking
Of where it all would lead

So I made you wake up
Said "let's take a walk"
I want to hold your hand
We don't have to talk

And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
And I can hardly wait

I can hardly wait

// From A Motel 6 //

You shouldn't hide but you always do
'Cause even when you're gone I can see right through
You want disconnection
You want me there enough for two

Pull a woolen blanket across my eyes
Dream a quiet place for us to fight
Oh no, your heart is broken
Don't you think that's a little trite?

I climb where I can see
You're close but I won't reach
Blank stare at the TV
CNN's on channel three

In the passing line on 1 and 9
Stuck in sad, car stuck in drive
Oh well, your heart is broken
Well, you can have what's left of mine

I climb where I can see
You're close but I won't reach
Blank stare at the TV
The Howling II's on channel three

Oh, I drift off to sleep
While the snow falls on the screen

// Double Dare //

I, I should know
You shouldn't have to tell me
Sometimes it's the way we feel or the way we feel
We feel pretty bad

In a double dare
He's got wandering eyes
And I see 'em look at you, looking straight at you
But I know where they are

I'll walk you home
You take as long as it takes
The sun in the morning sky, in the morning sky
We'll know where we are

We'll know where we are

// Nowhere Near //

Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Do you know this is real?
How I feel around you

When I see you look at me
I'm not sure of anything
All I know is when you smile
I believe in everything

Do you know how I dream?
How I dream about you
Do you know how I feel?
Do you know?

Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Doesn't take much to tell
That I love, oh, I

Everyone is here
But you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near

// Sudden Organ //

Will you stare?
Will you stare as the final curtain starts to fall?
Will you watch?
Will you watch with closing eyes, with closing eyes?

Everyone
Everyone's a little worried, you know I am
But I hate to watch the days go by
Watch the days go by

Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a sign

Well, I don't know
But I'm pretty sure that I want to shoot it in the back

As the days go by
I'm stepping on them all like ants
I've seen the way that they look at you

Maybe you
Or maybe not a guess, we'll know it after a while
I'm wondering just how this will stop
How's it gonna stop?

Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a sign

Another day
Another time
Another way for the moment
Watch it for a sign

// A Worrying Thing //

Will you ever say what I fear you're dying to say?
Well, I don't mind if I don't think about it
Another sleepless night reading over by the only light
But I don't mind if I don't think about it

What scares me most
I'll keep from you
If you want me to I'll keep from you

Does it makes sense to you, getting old, living life 22?
Well, I don't mind if I don't think about it

Let's go far away
Let's leave today
If you want us to we'll leave today

Will you ever say?

// I Was The Fool Beside You For Too Long //

I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too long

I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too long

The things about you that would drive me wild
Still drive me wild
But now in a different way

I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
I was the fool beside you
For too long

// The Whole Of The Law //

Well, I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean
If I knew that you were waiting for me
I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you

I'd escape from my chains
And I'll reach out for you

Maybe I'm in love with you
Maybe, maybe I'm in love with you
I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you
I had to contact

That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law
The whole of the law
