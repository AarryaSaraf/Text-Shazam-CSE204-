// Responsible //

Responsible, that's what it's gonna be
(Responsible for you) oh
(Responsible for me) well
Responsible, and that's what it's all about
Responsibility is something we can't do without

Quality and quantity, we only want the crème de la crème
We can't afford to be like others, you see
First they ain't right, then out again [?]

It's okay mean, the way it's got to be [?]
If were gonna have a chance at all
No love can survive deceptions or lies
We better off just staying friends

What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
Baby, we're together
We both know all good things come in time
And that's just what it is

Responsible, and that's what it's gonna be
(Responsible for you) oh
(Responsible for me) yeah
Responsible, and that's what it be about
Responsibility is something love can't deal without

We decided to get serious
Come with me to the real deal, yeah
Insecurities and slipping jealousy
Will cause our dreams to fade in the wind
We both want to be together
And what we have is so hard to find
Love is something we have to give both equally
And chill, and wait until the right time

My love is yours
Your love is mine
Baby, this could be forever
We both know that all great things come in time
Let's keep us together

Responsible, and that's what it's gonna be
(I'm responsible for you) oh
(You're responsible for me) mhm
Responsible, and that's what it be about
Responsibility is something we can't deal without

We can make it work
I want it so bad
Really bad
(Let's keep us together)

// Follow That And See (Where It Leads Y'all) //

You know, we really can't afford to wait any longer
For only we have the power to change anything
The future lies on our children
Give them hope... save them

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
You're the power and the source, use your positive force
(Follow it and see)
From your shoulders that you earn, from the shoulders that you learn
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Almighty God is deep in your heart
(Follow it and see)

Every nation's sound down [?] are people
(It's the people)
Let's not dog in, let's stop causing pain
(Yeeeah)
Let's take all that power and concentration
(From the children)
And teach our children truth and better gains
It's insane!

We stifle our nation with false education
Just follow it and see (where it leads y'all)
We can fool them all the day, tomorrow we will pay
(Follow it and see)
We teach them power and wealth - it's all for yourself
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Material things don't mean spiritual gain
(Follow it and see)
It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where it leads y'all)
Through the panic and discreet[?] truth will always set you free
(Follow it and see)

We don't have much time to go together
To change the things we let go on for so long (for so long)
Only we can stop this devastation (believe it)
If we don't (if we don't) this will o- (this will o-) -nly go on

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
Through the manic and the key[?] truth will always set you free
(Follow it and see)
The ocean's another place for dumping our poison waste
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
People dying all around, water poisoning the ground
(Follow it and see)
It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
You're the power and the source, use your positive force
(Follow it and see)

(Follow it and see, where that leads y'all)
(Follow it and see)

We are the landlords... yes, everything on this Earth is in our care.
We must stop this asinine madness of destroying so many things
And causing so much devastation, everywhere.

It's your time, it's your life, up to you, do it right
(Follow that and see, where that leads y'all)
Follow it and see
Following beacon light[?], you won't know until you try
(Follow that and see, where that leads y'all)
Almighty God is deep in your heart
(Follow that and see)
No more pranks, no more games, all heroes are the same
(Follow that and see)
Following beacon light[?], you won't know until you try
(Follow that and see)
Oh lord, yeah yeah, yeah...
(Follow that and see, where it leads y'all)
All night, it's gonna be alright...

// When Will I See You Again //

I'm still waiting for you to answer that question: when?
You know, when we're sitting there right now, we can almost...
Baby, I can almost read your mind
You just gonna let me suffer, right?
I want the answer to that question
When will I love you again?
Baby, when will I see you again?

Staring aptly [?] into sunlight
Turning daytime into night, tonight
Thoughts of raging passion and feeling
Wanting more and still believing, yeah yeah
Building all and having nothing
Living, but not really learning

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again, again
And when will I see you, girl I really need you again, again

Love is learning, never teaching
Climbing stairs that keeps on reaching
Higher, and higher
Life is made of right and wrongings
It's funny how we get so confused
Living in the world and finding
My inner feelings, there's no hiding
Sitting here and feeling lonely
Wishing I could hold you only

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I see you, girl I really need you again, again

You're teasing me... you know what you're doing
You know what you're doing
I think you love to tease me... please me

Staring aptly [?] into sunlight
Turning daytime into night, tonight
Knowing but not understanding
Giving all and still demanding
Fire burning inside ice cubes
Feel the beat but lose the groove
Yeah, alright

When will I hold you, when will I see you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again
And again, and again, and again
When will I see you, girl I really need you again, again
When will I hold you, girl I want to know you again
Well, well

// It's Getting Harder All The Time //

Can I share this with you?
Baby, you know imagination is really funny
Sometimes it's very hard to do, it's... impossible
Many nights and days, I... I've tried to imagine, what it would be like to love you
I've even tried to imagine, what you would look like, being loved
And I, I... I can't do it
I'm trying to do what a gentleman would do
Trying to be patient and tolerant, all the things that a man is supposed to be
But... I just wanted you to know very honestly, that I'm very anxious to be with you

It's getting harder all the time
Just to keep myself from wanting you
Harder every day, for me to stay away
Knowing, girl without your loving
I ain't worth one dime
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time
It's getting hard every night
Just to keep my hands from touching you
Oh darling, what am I to do [?]
And I hear you sigh
I might as well kiss my poor heart goodbye
And start to cry
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time
There's no fighting what I feel
Oh, God knows, I've tried
Tried to hold back my love from you
It's like trying to hold back the tide
It's getting harder, harder, harder all the time
I can't stop needing you
Oh, harder every day, for me to find a away
To keep myself from the tenderness
Of your lips touching mine
It's getting harder, harder all the time
All the time

I ain't worth a dime
It's getting harder, harder all the time
Harder, harder all the time
I need your lips close to mine...

// Don't Let Go //

There's not another smile in the world like that
The way your eyes light up when you smile...
Baby, I'm really in the mood for love
You have a way of, huh... just looking at me, and
Baby, I start to feel this urge to surge, of... of love inside of me
I wanna make love to you
Baby, I wanna make love with you
Ohh... come here, mmhm, give me your hand, touch me right here

Don't let go...
Baby, tonight we're gonna get
Closer, much closer...

Let me show you the feeling, girl
Over and over... tonight

I'm really feeling, not like ever before
Oh, don't let go
Just come and hold me forever
I love you so
Please don't stop, girl
Never, no ever
Tonight I'm feeling, unlike ever before

Oh, don't let go
You make love so tender, I surrender
Baby, let's come together
Forever and ever

Tonight, we're going to feel it
Unlike ever before

I will give my heart
I will share my soul, yes I will babe
If your love is real
Only if it's what you feel
If it's what you feel
Oh baby, oh baby
Ah, ah, ah

I will give my heart
I will share my soul
I wanna be with you babe, oh lord
If your love is real
Only if it's wha-ya-ya-at you feel
If it's what you feel
Oh darling

Don't you ever stop!
No, baby
What you do, do, do to me
No, don't you ever stop!
Don't you do it

Don't you ever stop! (ever stop)
(Don't you ever stop!) Never, ever, ever! Never
(Don't you ever stop!) Never, ever
Stop, stop, stop

// Love's Interlude / Good Night My Love //

What are you doing?
I was thinkin' about you and I I had to call
People sometimes disagree, feelings get hurt
I want you to know I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings
Or to make you sad and that I'm glad we got it all straightened out
And that's why I'm calling now, because
I want you to know how much I really appreciate, how much I really love you
No matter what happens in this world, I will always be there for you, always
Because I know that I will never feel this way with no one ever again
That I've got to do everything in my power to make sure that you understand
That I that I really really love you

Good night, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go there's just one thing I really need to know
Is your love girl still warm for me or has it grown cold
If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I care please give your love to me dear

Good night my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

If you should awake in the stillness of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I do care so please give your love to me dear

Ohh good night, my love take it easy
Pleasant dreams and stay right, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Good night
