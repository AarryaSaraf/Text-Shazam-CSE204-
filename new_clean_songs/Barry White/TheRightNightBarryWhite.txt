// As Time Goes By //

Time has always taught us, that most things are...
Are subject to change
But there's something mystical and magical about
Two people, and that thang they call love
No matter what comes and goes, that will always be the same

Mexico! ...ico!

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the fundamental things still apply
As time goes by
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-o-oes by

Moonlight and love songs (love songs) will never be out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate (oh no, no)
A woman needs man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's something (something) no one (no one) can deny (no one can deny!)

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goooes by
Ai-ai-ai-ay
Ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay-ay

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Moonlight and love songs, will never be out of date (oh love)
And hearts full of passion (oh yeah, yeah), jealousy and hate (oh yeah, yeah)
A woman needs a man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's still (still), still (still) to this day

So we must remember this
Love, a kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

As time goes by
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-oes by
And that's forever (forever)
And that's forever (forever)
And that's for... ever
And that's forever, ever
It's still the same old story (still the same old story)
Everybody fights for love and glory (fights for love and glory)
And that's for... ever

...ico! Let's go!

As time goes by...

// For Your Love (I'll Do Most Anything) //

I need to ask you something
I know my timing is probably bad
Baby, I really can't wait any longer, I...
I need to know what would it take
For me to convince you, that I would, heh...
I would love to spend some serious time with you
What would it really take?

Because baby, you are so radiant
Your eyes, your smile
You possess some king of mystical, magical fire
That attacks me, and attracts me to you
And maybe that's why I can't simply say
That I'm willing to do almost anything
Just to spend all of my time with you

I've got to let you know
Just how much you mean to me
Just to have you in my world alone
I'd give everything I own

Life has been a bore
But with you that is no more
You're what I need, oh-oh
With my eyes I can see
You're the only one that I've been waiting for, oh

It's not about the clothes you wear
It's not about the way you style your hair
It's just about the things you do
All I need, is only you

For your love - oh, I would do most anything
Any doggone thing
For your love, and all the joy you bring

Please don't say "no" to me
Come and end this nightmare
Hey there
Only you and you alone
You got to say you'll be there

I know I can make you love me
But you're gonna have to trust me
Say you will, oh
Please hear the words I'm sayin'
You gotta know that I'm not playin'
It's for free

Still, I'm not about just laying with you
With other guys that's all they want to do
You can have it all this time
If you would be only mine

For your love - oh, I would do any, any, anything
Anything, thing, yeah
For your love, and all that precious joy you bring

For your love - oh, I would do, know I would do
I would do any, any, anything
For your love, and all the joy, the sweet joy you bring

...Baby, I'm not talking about no short-term affair
I'm not talking about some "spur of the moment" thing or fling
I'm talking about serious, very serious time together
We can uncover and discover each other
You know, any guy would tell you anything you wanna hear
Just to... be with you
(For your love... and all the joy you bring)
All I'm doing... all I'm doing is expressing to you
The way I really feel
(I would do most any, anything)
For your love, heh... name it
Just name it

// There's A Place (Where Love Never Ends) //

Mmm... hm-hmmm...
You know, a kiss like that could really start something this evening tonight
I want you to go with me
It's your kind of place, it's very romantic
It's our kind of place
You know how you sitting there looking so beautifully, lady
And I, baby I really wanna feel your fire
I wanna see your passion, I... mm
Baby believe me, a kiss like that could really start something
I wanna take you there
I wanna be with you, and only you, there
Baby... trust me

There's a secret place
It's a love's hideaway
And it's not that far from here
Just imagine taking a ride
Streaking across the sky
And playing music as we fly

You would love the place where I go
It's the only place I know
Where we can lose all track of time
Loving each other, over and over again
Giving it all from within
Over and over, and over and over again

There is a place, where love just never ends
Can I show you just how it all begins?
Oh, it's magic, and also free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories

There is a place, where passion love never ends
Let me show you, just how we can begin
Ooh, it's wonderful, and I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it, how far do you want to go?

There's a place like you've got here
A [?], that must fear
And it's not that far away
It's in the other room
And we need to go there soon
'Cause baby, it's the only way to start

Oh, you're gonna love this place
I can see it on your face
And now is a perfect time
For making love, over and over again
Sexual healing within
All that it takes, is for you just to say "let's begin"

There is the place, where love just never ends
Let me hold you, this is how it all begins
We can make magic, and oh so free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories

There is a place, that only lovers share
Can I show you...? Oh, I want to take you there
Oh, it's wonderful, but I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it, how far do you wanna go?

Girl, there is the place... (forever)

Oh, what I would give, just to feel inside of you
Over and over... (over), I wanna get next to you

Baby we must, it's time for us
To do what comes naturally
And I really don't wanna wait any longer
And I don't think that you do either, I...
I get that feeling from just looking at you
Your face is so ready, and you... you're ready, aren't you?
(There is a place...)
Baby you're ready, I can tell you're ready
And I... and I'm ready too, so let me start here
(There is a place...)
Let me undo this, yeah...
(Oh lord, it's so good, it's so good)
I'll be there in a minute, baby, let me...
Let me do this
(Let me hold you)
Now let me do, this...
(There is a place, where love just never ends) Look at you... look at you

// Love Is In Your Eyes //

Your eyes... are the most beautiful eyes
And I can see a tiny little light, shining bright from your eyes
Sexy, sensual eyes... they say it all. The way you look at me...
Baby, I start to feel something moving and stirring inside of me
Can you feel it too? Can you?

You're like a dream in a movie scene
The part when your eyes can't leave the stream
A kiss in the dark, and you stole my heart
Oh love

I love how it feels, exploding inside
I've never ever felt this way in my life
I want you so, and want you to know

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in your eyes, I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, oh, oh...

One of a kind, you're simply divine
Sending those shockwaves through my mind
Holding you close, I need you the most

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in your eyes, I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, oh, oh...

It's in your eyes, they say you're gonna be with me
But not just tonight, yes I can see
That maybe it's forever
All the way - that's the only way I play
The time is so right, for you and I
To fly away on golden wings of love

Baby, in your eyes I can see the morning light
Endless paradise, as we're moving through the night
Love is in our arms, can't you see the morning light
Endless paradise, gently moving through the night
Oh, no, no...

Love is in your eyes, I see that morning light
Endless paradise, making love all through the night
In your eyes, in your eyes, it's in your eyes...
Tonight, that light, so bright, shining bright...
Your eyes, so bright...
It's all there, in your eyes...

It's in your eyes... stay and be with me
Stay here, close to me

// I'm Ready For Love //

What I wouldn't give, just to live one night with you
Sometimes people are misunderstood, their intentions, their feelings...
And I don't want you to misunderstand or misinterpret what I'm saying and feeling about you
Sometimes a man can believe in his heart, and he's felt everything that it is to feel
And then someone comes along, and this makes all of that so untrue

Lately, I've been thinking
Just how much you and I
Could spend the whole night through
Dancing away, and watching you smile
Enjoying all of each other's company, yeah

I've sent you (yeah) dozens of roses
Sitting with the gentle breeze [?]
That's sweet as your perfume
Sitting and talking
Our hands will touch, and love will start to bloom

Ooh, you feel it too
All I want is you...

I'm ready for love
This time I'm going to try
For love, I know I'm gonna make it
For your love
I swear this love will never die
Yeah yeah, never die, yeah

I'm ready for love (mm...)
But this time I found the friend
With your love, I know I'll make it through the end
Ready for love, but only if it's you and I
Oh my, oh my...
You and I, you and I, you and I

Oh, I've heard so many stories
I've learned the games, like foolish people do
I've played the part, and broke some hearts
But in the end, I'd wind up losing too

I'm waiting (yeah!), so don't fight the feeling
Let your whole heart take control
And give your love to me
Hope that it's all right
And we'll make love in perfect harmony

Ooh, you feel it too
And let's make it all come true...

I'm ready for love (hey)
This time I'm gonna try (oh yeah)
I'm ready for love, I know that I can make it
I'm ready for your love
I swear this love will never die

I know that well, and you can tell
I'm ready, but this time I found a friend
Ready, I know I'll make it through the end
Ready, only if it's you, you and I, I...
Ready, can't you feel the fire?
Yeah we're ready, I know we're gonna take it higher...

// Share //

Strange feeling I have... very different
Tension is all around us
I can feel the energy in the room
You feel it too, don't you?
We're sitting here, and both of us are thinking the same thing
And we want the same, identical thing
Because we both need the same thing
And we can have it, if you share
(I want your love)
Share your love with me, I give good love
The kind of love, that a woman like you must have
So please... share

A few times I know in my life
I made that cause, oh love
I'm no stranger to love
I thought I had befriended all [?]
Then something happened

Life is just from one kiss
We know, it don't mean no better
Let's take our time, blowing each other's mind
We can do it baby, if we try

Share (your love with me)
Baby, I'm here waiting for you
(I've lost your love)
We can make it all night
It's gonna be all right

Share (your love with me)
I can love you gently
Or any way you want me to
(I need your love)
Baby, love is waiting

This time I know we can make it
'Cause we learned what this is all about
And together, we'll know how to work it out
Read my lips: love will catch us, if we slip

We can take this fire, and turn it to rain
We can make our world into anything
We've got all the space and time
To blow each other's mind
We can't afford to let this chance go by

Share...
Share all of you with me
I wanna touch you from the inside, howlin' from the outside
To ease you, baby, to... to please you
Share yourself

Share (your love with me)
Baby, I'm waiting for you
(I want your love)
We can make it all night
It's gonna be all right

My favorite color I see: your blue panties
They look so good on you, come here
You're so soft
(All night, it's gonna be all right)
I love to touch you this way, and...
Handle you this way
I love it
(All night, it's gonna be alright)
Share...
You're sharing all of this with me
Your hair is so beautiful
(All night, it's all right)
Mmm, you'll see
(All night, it's all right)

// Who's The Fool //

People never cease to amaze me with their opinions, heh...
I shared my thoughts about us with a few friends of mine
And it was really amazing
How do people try to tell you, what you can do and what you can't do
I've been called a fool, crazy, simply because I told them that I wanted you

Who's the fool, who's crazy
I can't deny what I feel for you inside
Said the fool to the lady:
"I come alive, the moment I see you"
If wanting you is crazy
Then I'm a fool
Yes, a fool for you baby
And you, maybe you
Might be just a little crazy too

Never before have I known such a lady
And never before has it felt this good to me, my baby
Never before, and I wanna give my love so freely
Never before did I find being with someone so easy

By the way (by the way), ooh, the other day
I saw you, and I swear I knew
That I'd be here, right here, with you
Who's the fool...

Who is a fool?
Baby, you are so refreshing
Different in every sense of the word, you're...
You're someone that I've wanted for such a long, long time
To be here with you like this
To feel what I feel being here with you, like this
And baby, to know what I know is gonna happen
With me touching you like this
All night long like this

Who, who's the fool, who's crazy
Hey girl, tonight we're gonna make it all come true
Said the fool to his lady:
"I'm going to prove my love to you"

Never again will I love such a lady
Never again will it feel this good to me, my baby
Never again will I wanna give my love so freely
Never again will I find being with someone so easy

By the way (by the way), ooh, the other day
I saw you (you), baby I swear I knew
That I'd be here, laying right here, with you

Who's the fool...
I, I, I, I, I...
I like that, yeah yeah (admit it)
Oh, I like that, yeah yeah (I must admit it)

Let me reach inside and touch your spiritual soul
Let me put your body out of control (ah-whoo...!)

// The Right Night //

When you want to impress
(Somebody)
And trying to catch
(Somebody)
Remember the old school
And don't forget the old rule
"Haste makes waste"
And you don't want to worry
Keep this in mind
"All things in time"

And all once you're there next to you
And you're burning with desire

Look her right into her eyes and tell her
"Baby, I need your fire"

The lady's got a way of knowing
If you really mean it

One thing more
You've got to make sure that
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love everytime)

The right night
With the starlit sky
(It just makes it better when two are together)

Now you want her so bad
She's like no one you've had
That love is the passion
(It's causing that reaction)

Show her tenderness
Be gentle when you do it
You won't regret it
And she won't forget

And all once you're laying in your arms
Just before you start to do it

Remember it's not about what you've got, my friend
But how you use it

The lady's got a feel for what's real, and don't you forget it

One thing more
You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love everytime)

The right night
By the ocean side

The right night
And moonlight
(Nothing works better when two are together)

Well
Nothing gone better?
Nothing works better
When the two are together

To the guys worldwise
All things in time

You just got to make sure
That the time is right

Remember guys
The lady knows
Oh yes

You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Loving is better with love everytime)

The right
With candle-light
(Nothing works better when two are together)
