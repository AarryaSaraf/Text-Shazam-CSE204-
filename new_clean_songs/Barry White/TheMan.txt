// Look At Her //

- Can I have this dance?
- Is it all right?
- Yeah, it's all right. As long as you ain't slowdancing, junior

She's on the floor, baby do it
Right on time, really into it
I don't believe what I see
Blowin' my mind, killing me

(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her

Looking sharp, steppin' high
Sexy moves, watch her fly
Music turned up so loud
Clappin' hands, screaming crowd
Body heat fills the room
Madness will explode soon
I don't believe what I see
Blowin' my mind, killing me

(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she moves, look at her
(Look at her...)
The way she grooves, look at her

All right, all right, all right

(Look at her...)

// Your Sweetness Is My Weakness //

Ooh, girl, you know like I know, uh-huh
What your lovin, girl, has done for me
Like a Mona Lisa hangin on a wall, uh-huh

You're a lovely sight, lovely sight to see, mmm, hmm
The way you give me your sweet love
Any place and time when you look at me I get weak in my knees
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Girl, your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, well
Your sweetness is my weakness

They all say that I'm a fool, uh-huh
For lovin you, for lovin you this way
But sure as I am, I don't give a damn
About what the people, what the people say

Other girls try to imitate you
With the other boys, uh-huh
But I'm the only boy round here
Whose got the real macoy

Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Uh-huh), yeah (Uh-huh)
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Ooh), yeah (Ooh)
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness

// Sha La La Means I Love You //

Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by (passed them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try (let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even have a song to sing
All I know is

[Chorus:]
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby please now
Oh baby
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me (one for me)
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see (you will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

[Chorus]

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you, yes to you
Listen to me

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

Oh, you'll have to understand
Come on and take my hand

[Chorus]

// September When I First Met You //

September
Remember?
September
Remember?
September
Ooh...

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)

Oh, what a day it was
Everything so clear
Something about that day
I could feel it in the air
(In the air, everywhere)

Woo, suddenly I knew
Why I felt that way
The moment I laid eyes on you
Girl, I just had to say:

"Please let me be the one
You give your love to"
If we reminisce
Through all of this
Let's vow and make
Everyday anew

September
Remember?
September
Remember?

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)

Oh, what a night it was
How I had it planned
Things I would say and do
The way I'd hold your hand

But when you rushed into my arms
There was nothing left to say (nothing left to say)
I'll never forget that night
I'll never forget that day
Woo...!

September (remember?)
(September, remember?)
(September, remember?)
(September, remember?)

September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh
September (September)
When I first met you
Remember? (remember?)
Ooh, ooh

September, remember?...

// It's Only Love Doing Its Thing //

It's only love

Don't be afraid to touch me babe
Girl let's be real, there's nothing wrong
With the way we're carrying on
So enjoy and live

Because
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving

I wanna stay with you night and day
Until the end of time
It's okay when you lay
Lay your body next to mine

Because
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're feeling
It's only love doing its thing baby
It's only love that you're giving, giving

I wanna stay with you night and day
Until the end of time

// Just The Way You Are //

I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way... You are...

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you.

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are

// Early Years //

"As I look back on the days that's gone by, I can't help but to think:
"What would I have done different than I did at that time?"
And you know, what conclusion I come to is...
The conclusion I come to is: I would've done it just like I did it
There was days of joy, and happiness, and sadness, and madness...
The normal, the normal way of life
And as I, as I sit here reminiscing through my years, I...
Can't help but to feel a little sad inside
Because those days are gone, forever and ever, and ever, and ever..."

Yesterday we were so unafraid
But now we need some time to slip away
As we drift in our memories of all the joys and tears
Tasting vintage wine of early years

We sit and watch our life go passing by
And remember things we did, and wonder why
Looking through the misty clouds at days we had no fears
But that was long ago in early years

Time has gone by
Time from our lives
Those early years of time, gone by
Those early years, gone from our lives

From our lives, from our lives, our lives...
Well, well, well...

To appreciate your life, one has to know
Know the things it takes to keep your heart aglow
Keep your mind refreshed with thoughts of things we hold so near
Treasures from our lives in early years
