Album: WhoYouFightingFor

// Who You Fighting For? //

Queen and Country, freedom cry
God and Glory, Do or Die
Propaganda, Spin and Lie
Who are you fighting for.

[Chorus:]
You do the shooting - they do the looting
You do the killing - they do the drilling
You do the dying - they do the lying
All the way to the Bank
You can hear them crying

Sell the arms, suppress the truth
Create the fear, invent the proof
Wave the flag - don't tell the youth
Who they are fighting for

[Chorus]

Weapon dealing, profiteering
Country stealing, ethnic clearing
Assett stripping, oil dripping
Architects of War.

[Chorus]

// After Tonight //

I'm your key to set you free
You can come to me anytime for cover
Don't play shy, let me try
It's you really want and not another

[Chorus:]
Baby don't you fight
Or get your little self up tight, you know
Baby after tonight

You're alive but they could die
Won't you swim to me a little bit closer
I can read what you mean
It's you oh baby you, I'm looking after

[Chorus]

Baby, baby I said, I need your love
Baby, baby you're the one, I'm dreaming of
Baby, baby I said, I need your love
Baby, baby you're the one, I'm dreaming of

[Chorus]

// Bling Bling //

[Chorus:]
Bling,bling...yeah..aweh mi simting,
Bling,bling...emerald cut ring
Bling,bling...yeah..aweh mi simting,
Bling,bling chapparit and ting

Fifty men dead for this golden chain
Each link forged by a poor man's pain
Mined from below with sweat & fear
Brought to a shine with a widow's tear

[Chorus]

Fifty men dead for this diamond ring
Dat takes the shine off the cheap bling thing
Kind a mek you think it no bonafide
Fi wear souvenirs from the men that died

[Chorus]

If you really love me then don't buy me a ring
Diamonds & pearls they don't mean anything
All that I want is already here
Sitting by my side, you got nothing to fear

[Chorus]

Fifty men dead for this golden band
Underground with a pick in their hand
Cutting dirt where the sun nuh shine
Digging to survive in the man's goldmine

How many dead for this royal crown
This holy shrine we gather round
Worship the dollar, pon your hands & knee
Humbled in the presence of your jewellery

[Chorus]

If you really love me then don't buy me a ring
Diamonds & pearls they don't mean anything
All that I want is already here
Sitting by my side, you got nothing to fear

[Chorus]

// Plenty More //

On the radio wave the call to the grave
Is wrapped up in glory to fool the brave
They tell a tall story of all those that gave
All that they had fot the freedom they'd save

On the TV broadcast they said it won't last
All over by sunday, consigned to the past
The cleanup starts Monday despite the bomb blast
A brand new beginning the die has been cast

[Chorus:]
There's plenty more where that came from
Five megatons of oblivion
Sent with love from the Pentagon
On a laser guided Neutron Bomb

But a satellite link said it's worse than they think
They can't find the body: it's causing a stink
The guy in the Oval is back on the drink
And Uncle Sam's poodle's in need of a shrink

It's been a full year, the families can cheer
Their sons and their brothers are now in the clear
The war is all over but it would appear
That those left behind are all living in fear

[Chorus]

Loot shoot gunfire salute
How many innocent die every day
Loot shoot gunfire salute
Innocent die from the games that you play

Deceit and deception there's always some deception
Like the unjust executions dat they forget to mention
You stop, stare and wonder but a you mek di blunder
Your enemies draw near wid di sound like rolling thunder

Torture and detention there's always some detention
For the fall guy, the patsy, the one dem never mention
You play your war games and play with innocent life
You keep the dice rolling with elaborate lies

Loot shoot gunfire salute
How many innocent die every day
Loot shoot gunfire salute
Innocent die from the games that you play

// War Poem //

Silence falls in no man's land
To echo on uncertain steps
Sharp of eye & quick of hand
Advancing forward to regrets
Underfoot the bombs & mortars
Sleep awaiting coded warnings
From the top the barking orders
Light the sky on these dark mornings

[Chorus:]
Seek asylum from the terror
Reaching out for what it's worth
Shelter from the raging anger
Raining down on bitter earth

Sympathy for all who's hurting
Getting lost between the lines
It's the stuff that keeps returning
Laughing loud in victor's lies
Up above on wind's declaring
Soon the cold will whistle through
Push aside the warm sierras
Fill the sails that carry you

[Chorus]

Many miles are put between the
What once was & what will be
Sleepwalk nightmare to sweet dream
Each step consigned to history
Every whisper sings resistance
All emotions hide inside
Refugee looks to the distance
Out there somewhere lies his pride

[Chorus]

// Sins Of The Fathers //

Once upon a time, not so long ago
When things were much much simple,
And time would travel slow.
There came a righteous stranger,
With a bible in his hand.
To educate the sinners
And liberate the land.

[Chorus:]
Sins of the fathers
Today from old
In a never ending circle
Of people bought and sold
So the wretched of the earth
Would huddle from the cold
As a ship of fools go sailing
On an ocean black as gold

So come and sit beside me
And let my tale unfold
In a land on milk and honey
Where the truth must not be told
As men of right and reason
Let the devil take their soul
For greed and fame and fortune
And a river black as gold

[Chorus]

And all the non believers
Where hiding from the light
As a thousand burning crosses
Were scattered in the night.
The theives and the vagabonds
Were sinking in the sand
As a righteous lord and master
Stretches out a helping hand.

[Chorus]

And those who had to suffer
The sick the young the old
Where sacrifice to fortune
And left out in the cold
So with this new arrangement
The leaders sold their souls
For bangles, beads and baubles
And a river black as gold

[Chorus 2x]

// Good Situation //

That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night

Good evening sweet darling
May I ask your name
You seem to be lonely
Well don't worry I'm feeling the same

Oh it's a good situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a good situation
A splendid combination
Your something that
I just can't miss

That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night

It's been a long time sweet darling
Since love has come my way
But I'm trying so hard
To find the right words to say

Oh it's a good situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a good situation
A splendid combination
Your something that
I just can't miss

// Gotta Tell Someone //

[Chorus:]
I gotta tell someone, can anyone hear me
The girl of my dreams just told me that she loves me
She whispered and I was consumed so completely
Lost in the love that I feel whenever she's near me

She's got me wishing for something thats missing
Staring at the stars getting high on her kissing
Now i got my girl my girl got me
We're making plans for a family

[Chorus]

Together we'll stay come what may
Nothing come between us or get in our way
This is for real, the really big deal
At last we've found someone who knows how we feel

[Chorus]

She took me out walking I should not be talking
Whispered in my ear but I'm telling you nothing
If I were you; you know what I'd do
Get one of your own so you can whisper too...

[Chorus]

// Reasons //

Reasons why I love you - One
You light my day, you are my sun
Reasons why I love you - Two
I cannot get enough of you
Reasons why I love you - Three
I know that you'll be true to me
The reason I will stay with you
I know that you love me too!

[Chorus:]
The reason I will stay with you
I know that you love me too!
Meno tere bina chain nah aveh
Oh soniyeh

Reasons why I love you - Four
You keep me coming back for more
Reasons why I love you - Five
You make my world come alive
Reasons why I love you - Six
I'm addicted, your my fix
The reason I will stay with you
I know that you love me too!

[Chorus]

Reasons why I love you - Seven
You are here & I'm in heaven
Reasons why I love you - Eight
When it's good, you make it great
Reasons why I love you - Nine
You turn my water into wine
The reason I will stay with you
I know that you love me too!

[Chorus]

// One Woman Man //

I'm a one woman man after all these years
I've sailed with the tide on a sea of tears
Any port in a storm, I'd make my home
Any arms that were warm, when I was alone

[Chorus:]
When the moon was high, I would drift away
Into the night, until another day
When the sun comes up, I just wanna see
The woman that I love, lying next to me

I'm a one woman man I've got to say
You know that it hasn't always been this way
But that's all changed, I can say at last
I've waved goodbye to my chequered past

[Chorus]

I'm a one woman man & that's no lie
I've got no use for no alibi
Ain't got no time, cause time can fly
And when I'm not with her, then I can't get high

[Chorus]

// I'll Be On My Way //

The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss & I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

// Kiss And Say Goodbye //

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'til I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darlin', don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Many months have passed us by
(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
I've got ties, and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye (Goodbye)

(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Understand me, won't you try
(I'm gonna miss you)
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Take my hankerchief, wipe your eyes
(I'm gonna miss you)
Maybe you'll find, you'll find another guy
(I'm gonna miss you)
Let's kiss and say goodbye

// Things You Say You Love //

Lose, you're gonna lose
Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Can't last too long
The way you are shaping
Can't last too long
The way you're vibrating

Lose, your gonna lose
Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Can't last too long
The way you are flirting
Can't last too long
The things you are doing - that's why I say

Lose, you're gonna lose
Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Can't last too long
The way you are flirting

Can't last too long
The things you are doing

Lose, you're gonna lose
Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Can't last too long
The way you are shaping
Can't last too long
The way you're vibrating

That's why I say

Lose, you're gonna lose
Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Things you say you love
You're gonna lose

Things you say you love
You're gonna lose
