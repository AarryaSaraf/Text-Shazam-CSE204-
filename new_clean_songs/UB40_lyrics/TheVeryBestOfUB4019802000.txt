// King //

King, where are your people now?
Chained and pacified.
Tried in vain to show them how.
And for that you died.

You had a dream of a promised land.
People of all nations walking hand in hand
But they're not ready to accept
That dream situation, yet.

King, where are your people now?
Chained and pacified.
Tried in vain to show them how.
And for that you died.

// Food For Thought //

Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes,
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies.

Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead.
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head.
Politician's argue sharpening their knives.
Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives.

Ivory madonna dying in the dust,
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.

Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way.
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is here to stay.
Jesus son of Mary is born again today.

Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.

// One In Ten //

[Chorus:]
I am the one in ten
A number on a list
I am the one in ten
Even though I don't exist
Nobody Knows me
But I'm always there
A statistic, a reminder
Of a world that doesn't care

My arms enfold the dole queue
Malnutrition dulls my hair
My eyes are black and lifeless
With an underprivileged stare
I'm the beggar on the corner
Will no-one spare a dime?
I'm the child that never learns to read
'Cause no-one spared the time

[Chorus]

I'm the murderer and the victim
The licence with the gun
I'm a sad and bruised old lady
In an ally in a slum
I'm a middle aged businessman
With chronic heart disease
I'm another teenaged suicide
In a street that has no trees

[Chorus]

I'm a starving third world mother
A refugee without a home
I'm a house wife hooked on Valium
I'm a Pensioner alone
I'm a cancer ridden spectre
Covering the earth
I'm another hungry baby
I'm an accident of birth

[Chorus]

// Cherry Oh Baby //

Cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,

So, cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,
Don't you know I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe it's true,
What else is there for me to do?

Look how long I've been waiting,
For you to come right in.
And now that we are together,
Please make all my joys come over.

So, cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,
Don't you see I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do,
Then why don't you try me?

I will never let you down,
I will never make you wear no frown.
If you say that you love me madly,
Well, babe, I'll accept you gladly.

Cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,
Don't you see I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do,
Then why don't you try me?

I will never let you down,
I will never make you wear no frown.
If you say that you love me madly,
Well, babe, I'll accept you gladly.

// Red Red Wine //

Red red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I...
Still need her so

Red red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue heart

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart 

Red red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart...

// If It Happens Again //

[Chorus:]
If it happens again I'm leaving
I'll pack my things and go
If it happens again
There'll be no looking back
I won't say I told you so

You did what you were told
And you took the strain
Been left out in the cold
Got yourself to blame
But believe me,
If it happens again I'm leaving
If it stays the same I'm gone
When you're stabbed in the back
And there's salt in the wound
The it's time to move along

[Chorus]

No more spanners in the works,
All the works been done
Had your face rubbed in the dirt
On show for every one
But believe me
If it happens again I'm leaving
If it stays the same I'm gone
When compromise is the song you sing
It's been going on to long

[Chorus]

// Don't Break My Heart //

You shoot me down in flames
You put me down a lot
But I'm giving you my heart
Go on take it
Please be careful not to break it
Just remember it's the only one I've got
It's the only one I've

Don't break my heart

You make me laugh a lot
And buy me silly things
And I'd rather be with you than anyone else
But if you make me mad
But if you make me mad
You'll wish that you had not
You'll wish that you had not

Don't break my heart

Where are the roses and whispered sighs
Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes
It doesn't matter you see
I know you love me
And real basic love never dies

Don't break my heart

// I Got You Babe //

They say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know babe if that's true
'Cause you got me and baby I got you

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you, to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And when I get scared you're always around

So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you and I won't let go
I got you to love me so

[Repeat until fade:]
I got you, babe

// Watchdogs //

You try to close your ears
And you try to close your eyes
But the blasphemies keep coming
Tempting you with lies

[Chorus:]
Give thanks for your protection
Your watchdogs of the night
Who hold the hungry wolves at bay
And keep them out of sight, out of sight

You just don't understand it
But it strikes a distant chord
So you look for away of escaping
And sanity's restored

[Chorus]

You focus your direction
Cloak tightly pulled around
But somewhere in the distance
You can hear a haunting sound

[Chorus]

You're in danger of corruption
And you're always running scared
You cannot make decisions
You're completely unprepared

[Chorus]

// Rat In Mi Kitchen //

[Chorus:]
There's a rat in mi kitchen what am I gonna do?
There's a rat in mi kitchen what am I gonna go?
I'm gonna fix that rat thats what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna fix that rat.

When you open your mouth you don't talk, you shout
And you give every body the blame,
But when they catch you up,
They will shut you up
And you got no one to blame

[Chorus]

When you out on the street,
You practice lies and deceipt
And you scandalize my name
But when I catch you up
I'm gonna pull you up
I'm gonna check-out inside your brain

[Chorus]

When yo deh pon the scene,
You make everyone scream
Because they know your so unjust
But when they catch you up
They will kick you up
Because you someone they cannot trust

[Chorus]

You invade my space
Make me feel disgraced
And you just don't give a damn
If I had my way
If I had my say
I'd like to see you hang

[Chorus 2x]

// Sing Our Own Song //

The great flood of tears that we've cried
For our brothers and sisters who've died
Over four hundred years
Has washed away our fears
And strengthened our pride
Now we turn back the tide

We will no longer hear your command
We will sieze the control from your hand
We will fan the flame
Of our anger and pain
And you'll feel the shame
For what you do in gods name

We will fight for the right to be free
We will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song

When the ancient drum rhythms ring
The voice of our forefathers sings
Forward Africa run
Our day of freedom has come
For me and for you
Amandla Awethu

We will fight for the right to be free
We will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing
We will sing our own song

// Kingston Town //

The night seems to fade,
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright,
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

Oh Kingston Town,
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see, the girls at play
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And when I am king,
surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

Oh Kingston Town,
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see, the girls at play
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And when I am king,
surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

// Homely Girl //

It must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say,
you looked better in the dark.
But now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you

The teacher would ask the questions
And you, would always raise your hand
But somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes you are
Homely girl you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah

There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Oooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl

I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
And the dirty looks
Cause I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how, they don't know how

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah
Homely girl you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman, ooh yea, ooh hoo
You're a beautiful woman

// Bring Me Your Cup //

Did I ever say, how I feel about you
A thing I never found that easy to do
The things that you do, don't need to be heard
You know your actions, baby, speak louder than words

I've got the bottle, bring me your cup
Pop the cork, and try a sup
And when you're empty, I'll fill you up
We'll drink it down till the sun comes up

I'm heading home, like a steaming train
Foot to the floor, in the driving rain
My head is aching and my mouth is dry
I've got a thirst only you can satisfy

I've got the bottle, bring me your cup
Pop the cork and try a sup
And when you're empty, I'll fill you up
We'll drink it down till the sun comes up

// Higher Ground //

Moon and stars sit way up high
Earth and trees beneath them lie
The wind blows fragrant lullaby
To cool the night for you and I
On the wing the birds fly free
Leviathan tames angry sea
The flower waits for honeybee
The sunrise wakes new life in me.

And every hour of every day I'm learning more
The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground...

The fishes swim while rivers run
Thru fields to feast my eyes upon
Intoxicated drinking from
The loving cup of burning sun
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time another place

And every hour of everyday I'm learning more
The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground...

// (I Can't Help) Falling In Love With You //

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay would it be a sin
But I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you

I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you

// Tell Me Is It True //

Tenderly she smiles
Forgiving my mistakes
Getting her to love me
Was my biggest break
Every place I go, she's inside of me
Giving up her love unconditionally

She shines the sun
She pours the rain
She touches me in places that I can't explain
She's got a powerful hold on me
The kind of hold from which I'd never struggle free

Tell me what you know
Tell me is it true
Do you really love me just like I love you
Everything I say
Everything I do
It's purely cos' I'm aiming to get hold of you

People tell her she could do better than me
She wouldn't necessarily agree
We've got a thing going on you see
The two of us together for eternity

Tenderly she smiles
Forgiving my mistakes
Getting her to love me
Was my biggest break
Every place I go, she's inside of me
Giving up her love unconditionally

Tenderly she smiles
Forgiving my mistakes
Getting her to love me
Was my biggest break
Every place I go, she's inside of me
Giving up her love unconditionally

She shines the sun
She pours the rain
She touches me in places that I can't explain
She's got a powerful hold on me
The kind of hold from which I'd never struggle free

Tell me what you know
Tell me is it true
Do you really love me just like I love you
Everything I say
Everything I do
It's purely cos' I'm aiming to get hold of you

People tell her she could do better than me
She wouldn't necessarily agree
We've got a thing going on you see
The two of us together for eternity

Tenderly she smiles
Forgiving my mistakes
Getting her to love me
Was my biggest break
Every place I go, she's inside of me
Giving up her love unconditionally

// Come Back Darling //

Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

Don't you know, I need you badly
And I'll give my poor heart gladly
I need your love like roses need the rain
Don't let me cry in pain

Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

Can't you see the love still burning
Please return, relieve my yearning
A day without you is like a year of emptiness
Please return and bring me happiness

Come back darling
Give me another try
I'll make you satisfied

// The Earth Dies Screaming //

A warm dry wind is all that breaks the silence,
The highways quiet scars across the land.
People lie, eyes closed, no longer dreaming,
The earth dies screaming.
Like scattered pebbles, cars lie silent waiting,
Oilless engines seized by dirt and sand.
Bodies hanging limp, no longer bleeding,
The earth dies screaming.

The earth dies screaming
The earth dies screaming
Your country needs you, lets strike up the band.

The earth dies screaming
The earth dies screaming
Despite all odds we must defend our land.

Half eaten meals lie rotting on the tables,
Money clutched within a boney hand.
Shutters down, the banks are not receiving,
The earth dies screaming.

// Light My Fire //

You know that it would be untrue
You know that it would be lie
If i was to say to you
Girl we couldn't get much higher

The time to hesitate is true
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love becomes a funeral fire

The time to hesitate is true
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love becomes a funeral fire

[Chorus:]
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is true
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love becomes a funeral fire

[Chorus]

You know that it would be untrue
You know that it would be a lie
If i was to say to you
Girl we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
