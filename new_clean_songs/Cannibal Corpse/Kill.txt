Album: Kill

// The Time To Kill Is Now //

We see them coming a mile away
Gathered to kill on the desolate plain
No fear in our minds
Pure hate in our hearts

Miscalculation of our strength their bane
Take us lightly and we'll make you pay
Pride left them defenseless
No mercy for Hubris

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

They rush to fight us and we stand and wait
Pulses quicken as they take the bait
Mere seconds to slaughter
We can wait no longer

Closing fast with their weapons high
Still believing it's we that will die
Now the ambush is sprung
Now they learn they were wrong
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart

They thought it would be easy but now they're being crushed
Arrogance of power leaves them dying in their blood
There will be no mercy for these filthy sons of whores
The innards of my enemies impaled upon my sword
Many years we've waited for this final day of slaughter
Our victims are decapitated, their limbs are torn asunder
Careful preparation brought our haughty victims down
Our forces are at full strength and the time to kill is now.

Time to kill is now

Time to kill

They are all dead, it's their end today
All lost their lives in tremendous pain
Not one has survived
We left none alive

Do not doubt our conviction to kill
Hate on our side we will never fail
Now the killing will start
Tear the bastards apart
Strike the enemy down
The time to kill is motherfucking now

// Make Them Suffer //

Suffer

Extreme pain is what they need to feel for the rest of their lives
Misery and despair leaves their souls when infinity ends

Let them taste the wrath as the agony consumes them
Swallowed by the darkest light a blackened state of dismay
Survival is the only thing left for them
This grievous revelation is a new beginning
Led to the solution against their will

Deprivation thrives as the therapy continues
Sullen mastery is an answer uncontested
Denial is the only thing left for them
Life as they knew it is a distant memory
Scores of victims lust for apathy

Make them suffer
While they plead for cessation
Entirely demoralized and close to mass extinction
Damned to please supremacy
The reason for their martyrdom they will never know

Make them suffer
While they bleed through damnation
Begged for retribution before meeting with demise
Cursed by animosity
Once chosen for this mad ordeal there is no escape

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Domination reigns supreme the evil has no end
Spent of all their energy now worthless and degraded
Slow death is the only thing left for them
Physically and mentally devoid of dignity
Languished immortality

Make them suffer

While they plead for cessation
Entirely demoralized and close to mass extinction
Damned to please supremacy
The reason for their martyrdom they will never know

Make them suffer
While they bleed through damnation
Begged for retribution before meeting with demise
Cursed by animosity
Once chosen for this mad ordeal there is no escape

Make them suffer
Forever

// Murder Worship //

Homage to our God, the act of killing bears us
Closer to His grace, beyond the void of darkness
Every drop of blood, a chance to deify us
Bring us to our lord our killings transcending
Convictions of violence pure, unrelenting

Devotion drips from my jagged blade
My righteous hate fuels unyielding rage
Sacramental slaughter all for faith
In the homicidal doctrine he creates

Decapitated heads, adorn the holy altar
Kneeling at its base, we stare in veneration
Every single death, brought us closer to Him
Take us to our Lord our bloodlust evolving,
Enshrining the bodies, evil emerging

Hate rips through flesh and bone
The dogma states that it must be done
We adhere to the holy text
More must die if we are to advance

Pray to our God
With blood we praise His epic acts of hate and homicidal glory, legendary murders
Trust in our Lord
Leads us to kill in the same way that He did, sever all the heads in sacrificial splendor
He is close now
Soon He will be among us leading, violence, ruin, divinity, homicide

Kneeling in the blood, we see our Master watching
Look behind His eyes, a soul so ruthless, perfect
Transfixed by His gaze, His congregation waiting
We summoned Him here by doing His bidding
Now He will slay us, circle completed

Arterial spray paints the temple red
Our Master's advent brought us death
Rapturous screaming fills these hallowed halls
Blood soaked paradise awaits us all

// Necrosadistic Warning //

Hordes of the rotting dead surround the villagers
Unwary victims mangled and battered
Once buried warriors have risen to kill again
Signs of their wickedness left for a warning

Mutilate
Disembowel
Amputate
Kill and rape

Gratification achieved by dismemberment
Unnatural legions ravage the carcasses
Open wounds targets for evil defilers
Seed of iniquity covers the body parts

Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace

Violate
Death so foul
Ejaculate
Pieces raped

Bound with intestines the body is held upright
Travelers encounter the gruesome monition
Terrorized realization of coming death
They will be next for the army of killers
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Remains are on display
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Molested corpses hang

Undead
Molest
Defile

Kill them
Butcher
Then fuck

Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Discharge on the corpse
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Desecration of the dead

[Solo: Pat O' Brien]

// Five Nails Through The Neck //

Knock him out with chloroform
Surreptitious trapping tack
Drag the body to the trunk
Take the captive to the house and down into the basement

Binding method is extreme
Unconscious I will pierce the hands and feet
Arms and legs nailed to the wood
Beneath the table blood is forming shallow pools

Perforate the abdomen
Punctured organs start to fail
Mounting pain revives the man
His gaze meets mine then panic starts, the nails leave him immobilized

Head is thrashing from the pain
I must nail it to the wood with long sharp nails
Penetration of the flesh
Five dozen nails will hold him down

Five nails
My hammer pounds them, the steel secures him
Five nails
My victim conscious, he is immobile
I raise my hammer, and aim for the throat

Five nails through the neck

Trachea is torn
Gasping sounds are heard
Life is leaving him
But not soon enough

Agony, torturous

Long nails penetrate
Through the flesh and bone
Table dripping blood
Victim full of holes

Suffer, merciless

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Five nails through the
Five nails through the neck

60 nails adorn the fool
12 on each leg and arm
4 of them aerate his face
3 puncture his abdomen and leave his vitals oozing

I step back and view my work
Torture victim lies drained of life
Outside world will never know
How many nails the victim felt before he died

Five nails through the neck

// Purification By Fire //

Internal burning
An omen reborn
Embrace the torture
Purify the soul

Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin become a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding

Eternal burning
Sanctified with flames
Unholy recourse
The demons are here
Unleash the fury

Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance

Purification by fire
Transformation is rapture

Beyond recognition and deranged from the cleansing
Frenzied schizophrenic a memory before the scalding
Sacrifice for pain

Unrelenting heat scrambles the sense
Caustic remedy betrays existence
Hellish invasion just part of the plan
Beasts have been summoned to conquer again
Unleash the fury

Internal burning an omen reborn
Embrace the torture purify the soul

Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin becomes a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding
Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance

Purification by fire
From within the torment is complete
Any worthy future now obsolete
Purification by fire, transformation is rapture

// Death Walking Terror //

I am the black thoughts of the night
Deep in the darkness of your mind
Shrouded in shadow, the mental torture
In the realm of death walking terror

Stalking the closest to the edge
Imposition of depravity
Sanity holding by a thread
Desperation draws them close to me

Always unseen but never far behind
Fleeting darkness tricks your eyes
Paranoia, a creeping horror
Guided by the death walking terror

Your hand reaches for the knife
Subconscious molding insidious
It was always in your mind
Release the pain, a psychotic rush

Death walking terror
Slow mental torture

I am the blood you seek to spill
I am your inner drive to kill
Dark inspiration, a moral failure
Created by the death walking terror

Your hands have done my bidding well
Your hideous dreams now reality
Manipulation done with stealth
I was with you, I heard the screams

Death walking terror
Slow mental torture
Death walking terror
Psychic tormentor

The weakest ones will fall
My murderous influence appeals to their fear
My will is just too strong
The decision was mine but they'll never know

Death walking terror

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

I walk behind you while you kill
Usurping your mind, you are oblivious
You'll never know your spirit fell
Supplanted by this deep disgust

Death walking terror, slow mental torture
Death walking terror, psychic tormentor

// Barbaric Bludgeonings //

Moving through the cover of night
With battle hardened hate in their eyes
Anticipate the surgical strike
Will suffer, panic stricken, traumatizing agony

Violence, the purest form, a primitive trait
The weak will inherit the Earth piled on top of their graves
Survival is slipping the attack has already begun
Dominant force batter their prey, bludgeons their weapon of choice
A vicious tradition since the dawn of man

Traumatizing agony
Murderous revelry, smashing people to pieces
This kind of hate cannot be contained
Those who have fallen onto the ground will never rise again

Squalid and broken no match for the enemy
Too weak to fight back no chance for escape
Covered in their own blood
The surgical strike must go on
Ripping out organs they're hung on display
A message to others they'll die the same way
Covered in their own blood
The surgical strike must go on

[Solo: Rob Barrett]
[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Squalid and broken no match for the enemy

The surgical strike must go on
Ripping out organs they're hung on display
A message to others they'll die the same way
Covered in their own blood
The surgical strike must go on

Moving through the cover of night
With battle hardened hate in their eyes
Anticipate the surgical strike
Will suffer, panic stricken, traumatizing agony

// The Discipline Of Revenge //

Patience is my ally
Design should not be rushed
Aspersions long forgotten
Never left my mind

My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Master of self control
Seething deep inside
Enemies oblivious
My ruse has made them blind

My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right

My hate has been concealed my time has come at last
My hate has been concealed but now the scum will die

Batter the face
Crushing the pompous fool
Retaliation
This was worth the wait

Endurance
Deception
Abhorrence

Vengeance
Wounds of the enemy
Oozing hypocrisy
Duplicitous slime
They are less than nothing

Twisted
Slaves to their vanity
They are beneath my feet
Only now can they learn
As my boot kicks their heads

Pitiless tormenting
Resolve never wavering
Contemptible pieces of human trash litter my life

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Victory was certain
They never saw it coming
Years of planning have paid off
Voices inside silenced

// Brain Removal Device //

Heads removed of their faces lay by my feet
Chopped and hacked their bodies detached
Eyes and teeth are violently smashed
Gruesome acts

I'm having strong urges to extract the brains
Overwhelmed with demented thoughts
Could it be that I committed these
Gruesome acts

Death is all I ever know
Gore is what I need to help satisfy me
Brains are all I ever crave
Can't deny my hatred for society
Blood so sweet upon my lips
Live a life of moribund abnormalcy
Born with only half a head
Can't deny my hatred for intelligence

The brain removal device

Drained again through the mouth the blackest blood flows
Save it for another day
Savor the vile abundance of
Gruesome acts

Dead is like being alive
Stench of rotting death becomes irrelevant
Heads affixed to a machine
Peel the skin from random skulls exposing bone
Cracked open with vice like force
Spray my face with human slop, carnal spatter
Slave to my repulsive goal
To regain control beyond what's in my mind

The brain removal device

Shredded brain tissue is mine
Succulent flavor is pure
Evil is personified
Dominance

Brutal conclusion foreseen
Envisioned so long ago
The slaughtered were unaware

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Contraption for hollowing heads
Is forcing me to realize
Cerebral obsession within is my reality

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Death is all I ever know
Gore is what I need to help satisfy me
Brains are all I ever crave
Can't deny my hatred for society
Blood so sweet upon my lips
Live a life of moribund abnormalcy
Slave to my repulsive goal
To regain control beyond what's in my mind

The brain removal device

// Maniacal //

Rage, taking control of my mind
Driving me to
Kill without mercy
I see red
Blood on
My hands
My knife
Crazed, boiling blood pumps through my heart
Pushing me to
Respond with violence
I spill their
Blood with
Vicious
Cruelty

Maniacal
Psychopath

Slash through the crowd of faces leaving a trail of bloody dead
Hold down the scumbag, slice off his ear, gouge out his fucking eyes

Pounding the human maggots, broken bones cause screams of pain
Femur pokes through the muscles in his upper leg, I wrench it out with force

Stabbing the faces
Knocking out teeth with my nail spiked bat
Internal damage
Trauma from beatings causes organs to burst

Maniacal
Psychopath

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Chunks of butchered victims cover the floor in my wake
Frenzied battery and slashing slung pieces of face on the ceilings and walls

Raging violence will consume all of my damaged brain
Ruthless murders are the only way to make this impulse abate

Maniacal
Psychopath

// Submerged In Boiling Flesh //

Dangling above a vat of putrid muck
A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before
Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate
I will be submerged in boiling flesh
This cauldron will soon take my life

Upside down my mind is warping
Cannot break free
From the shackles
Bloodied chains cut circulation
Losing reason
Gag and vomit

Blisters are forming all over my body now
Oozing with pus as they start to explode, fervent finality
The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs
Writhing and twitching from maddening pain
Why must I die like this?

Insanity not far away
Mental breakdown
Scathing havoc
Pray for death to come and get me
Inner anguish
Begins

Fear
Received Relentless
Malignancy

Near the end is what I'm sensing
Must accept it
Can't accept it
Last attempt to stop this nightmare
Cannot be done
I will be dead

Gone
Berserk
While waiting
My life will boil

To struggle is useless

[Solo: Rob Barrett]

Plunge
Fatal
Paradise
Of the obscene

[Solo: Pat O'Brien]

Enter the tank
It doesn't take long
Epidermis dissolved
All that's let are my bones
It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh
My body now part of sick mire
This chamber of liquefied humans that I have amassed is completed because I was
The last in line
