// Savage Butchery //

Striking out with rage I pound him, stomp him
Cocksucking bastard don't feel mercy for him
With bare hands I break his legs, break his neck
Now my jagged blade will bring him to his death

Savage killer merciless machine
Butchering victims and watching them bleed
Savage killer chopping off limbs
Butchering for revenge, heartless assassin

Now the cutting starts I stab him, slash him
Less than a minute he became a victim
Now I will sever his legs, his neck
Hatred enemy his body I dissect
Savage

Savage
Butchery
Ravage
Ruthlessly

Veins spray blood it splashes in my eyes
Impulse of my rage will dictate how he dies
Chopped up while alive or killed with the first strike
What's left of his life is dripping from my knife

Savage killer merciless machine
Butchering victims and watching him bleed
Savage killer chopping off limbs
Butchering for revenge, heartless assassin

Savage
Butchery
Ravage
Ruthlessly

// Hatchet To The Head //

Skull fragments are flying through the air
Brains and blood scattered just about everywhere you look
Swing of the hatchet gives permanent damage,
Head fractured, gaping hole
To incise the cranium

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head

Rekindled gore obsess rend the weak
Mutilate then murder consciously
Death brought to the enemies of the past
A life of beheading I must have
Pure revenge is burning inside me

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head

Forced from deep inside to hunt you
Bludgeoned torn apart veins erupted
Forever headless rotting corpse
Recognition you are now beyond

Wretched, onslaught, slaughter

Faceless flesh remains from the victims
Hacked with brutal force until slain
Consumed with anger, lunacy
Relentless killing dependency

[Solo: Pat]

Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore

Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head

Chop it off!

// Pit Of Zombies //

Captured by the priest of evil
Deep inside the hive
Hellish dungeon filled with undead
Their rotting claws reaching for my
Legs I hang above the ghouls
I know they want me for their food
Overwhelmed by deadly fear
Hung above the Zombie lair

Hanging by a thread above them
Taken here to die
Rotting hands reaching for me
Their undead eyes see me as a meal
They want to eat alive
Mindless hunger in their eyes
Filthy claws grasp at my feet
Slashing wounds my ankles bleed

Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Death is grisly
Lowered slightly now they reach me
I scream in frantic pain
Tearing off my feet with fury
The pain intense below my knees my
Legs have been removed
They suck the blood from the wounds
Voracious zombies rend my thighs
They pull me down, my corpse they
Will divide

Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the
Pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me

They claw at my face
And rip off my scalp
Exposing my skull
Arteries severed
Gushing blood showers them drives
Them mad raging mob
A hideous feast

Puncture my stomach and
Tear out the guts
Devour entrails
Rotting zombies have torn me apart
They gorge on my flesh

Engulfed
Consumed
This pit
My doom

My Mind's still functions
But my body's in pieces.
Somehow I live
I can feel them tearing flesh, ripping skin, gnawing bones, eating me
Why won't this end?

Engulfed
Consumed
This pit
My doom

Engulfed alive
Consumed by death
This pit of zombies
My doom is here

[Solo: Jack]
[Solo: Pat]

Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me

// Dormant Bodies Bursting //

Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Detonate, polluted, pandemic
Unburied decedents that no longer die
Dispelled amok amongst sickness
The dead and living are one
When dormant bodies are bursting

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Infernal, disaster, revulsion

Dormant bodies bursting

Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life

The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts

Detonate, polluted, pandemic

// Compelled To Lacerate //

Vicious thoughts will overpower
His virulent mind explodes
Unable to suppress the madness
He can't contain this inner pain
Compelled to

Lacerate
Rendering for release
Set free souls through holes in their skin
Murdered, or have they been saved

Bleeding corpse his work of art
Human flesh a canvas
Craftsman of macabre creations
He can't control it makes him whole
Compelled to

Lacerate
Rendering for release
Slicing through victims and then he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A gristly gift of art

[Solo: Jack]

Mangle them ripping death lacerate them

Stunning victims with a club abducted with
Stealth taken to his home
Ropes and chains restrain his living subject of art
He stabs
Grating with a jagged edge his prey screams in pain
Writhing under his knife
Driven to improve his victims through gruesome
Design, he cannot stop
Compelled to

Lacerate rendering for release
Mutilate now it's time to slice

[Solo: Jack]

Mangle them ripping death lacerate them

Lacerate from release
Slicing through victims and the he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures Sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A grisly gift of art

// Drowning In Viscera //

Engulfed in the innards
Of rotting cadavers a rancid gore sea
Asphyxiation
Tangled intestines become my reality
Choking on guts
Asphyxiation gasping for breath
Drowning in viscera

Slowly to taper away dissipate
Absorbing this ultimate carnage
Surrounding me
Soaking in entrails decayed
Decomposed

Entombed without reason
In moist isolation of repugnancy
Morose sensation
Covered completely as terror
Enhances pain, to suffocate
Morose sensation gasping for breath
Drowning in viscera

Sinking in this tamped hell, pestilent
Smothered in heaping chunks
Stinking flesh putrefies
Decomposition ensures burial
Inundated languid doom

[Solo: Pat]

Iniquity, submerged ending
Primeval swamp, sanguinary
Inescapable abuse

[Solo: Jack]

Starting to fade, blood saturates
Deadly embrace, immolated
Imbrued with pus of the dead

Eviscerate another life gutted soul
Morbidity, obliterate
Engrossing plight fatal rot
Consuming scum
Drenched in evil excrement
Sent to a world to die in pain by
Drowning in viscera

Engulfed in the innards
Of rotting cadavers a rancid gore sea
Asphyxiation
Tangled intestines become my reality
Choking on guts
Morose sensation gasping for breath
Drowning in viscera

Eviscerate another life gutted soul
Morbidity, obliterate
Engrossing plight fatal rot
Consuming scum
Drenched in evil excrement
Sent to a world to die in pain by
Drowning in viscera

// Hung And Bled //

Trying to conceal his murders the
Maniac
Stabs the heart
Stops the flow
Cleaning up the blood's a problem he
Now solves
Hooks through heels
Hung and bled

Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying dripping bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor

Congealing fluids fester the stench
Revolting septic gruel
Putrid slop
Licks the surface of his dungeon
A gruesome meal
Rancid feast live on death

Corpses dangle lifeless gray and cold
Rotting flesh the meat hooks lose their
Hold
Stenching body falls onto the ground
Bones and flesh form a mound

Sanguinary killer will not stop
Hanging dead replacing those that drop
Blood he drinks like wine their flesh
His bread in his maw dripping red
Hung and bled

Oozing blood the butcher's victims
Soak the concrete
Putrefy
Halls of dread
Draped with death
Ornate crimes
Stalactites made of flesh
Festooned with innards
Gaining life
Sentient place, the stone walls
Breathe
Hungry soul
It can think
A genuine living hell
Created by
The butcher he lost control
Owner and property change their roles
Constantly feeding the gluttonous room
He once ruled the chamber
Now it's his tomb

Hung by their feet
Drained of blood
Swallowed by death
Greed of this place
Bodies
Decay, devoured by evil
Slave to this hell
He creates
Undying

[Solo: Pat]

Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying dripping bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor
Corpses he suspended turning pale
All the blood drained into his grail
Fastened to the ceiling dry and dead
Fluids of life have been shed
Hung and bled

// Sanded Faceless //

Rapacious for pleasure scraping
Filing down with intense grinding
Harsh abrasive friction deface
Countenance now removed forever

Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless

Rubbing off a humans visage
Enduring display of malice
With celerity they perish
Countenance now removed forever

Everything gone from the head
Miasmal menace
All curves of a face are now smooth
Forced a new surface
Sanded faceless
Obscurity into black
Outrageous agenda
Sensory perception lost
Left to die in pain
Sanded faceless

[Solo: Pat]

Insane appearance eyeless
To calibrate the skull
Image erasing soulless
Retexturing of flesh
Suddenly to be faceless
For perpetuity

Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless

// Mutation Of The Cadaver //

Lying on the table dead
Coroner
Completes his task

Examining the wretched stiff
Suicide
The likely cause

Behind closed doors the change
Begins
Then it grows
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver

Coroner returns to notice
Subtle change
How can this be?

Must be his imagination
The man's been dead
For several days

The change continues after hours
Different face
Mutilation of the cadaver
Soon the corpse will change its shape
Who is it?

Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver

The coroner returns and sees
The body has truly changed
The corpse has stolen his face
And now he loses his mind

[Solo: Pat]

[Solo: Jack]

Shocking evolution
Mutation of the cadaver
Hideous conversion
Mutation of the cadaver
Postmortem upheaval
Mutation of the cadaver
Awful transformation
Mutation of the cadaver
Gruesome reconstruction
Mutation of the cadaver

// When Death Replaces Life //

Smashing the human horde
Crushing religious filth
Nailing invertedly the ones who plant the seeds
Of doubt
Wasting inherent truth
Confronting an inner hell
Cursing subconsciously the ones who reap the
Seeds of doubt

How can humans play God when they are all
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life

Tearing the vocal chords of prophets that spoke of lies
Unwanted
They are the ones controlling the seeds of doubt

How can humans play God when all they are are
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life

Fearing their fate they chose a random date
When all life would cease and rapture would
Release
Trampling the meek the gospel they did speak
Foretelling demise speaking only lies

[Solo: Jack]

Feeding the senseless souls of mindless
Inhabitants not knowing they are the ones
Consuming the seeds of doubt
Finding the source of stimulation unnurtured
Realization of fools who will always against their
Will just end their lives

How can humans play God when all they are are
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life

// Grotesque //

Monstrous
My thoughts
Revolting visions, carnage
Bloodbath
My dream
Gore soaked
My hands
Hallucination, or real
I wield
The blade

Grotesque...mind...grotesque

Visions
Murder
See myself slashing, the throats
Victims
My friends
Horror
My crimes
Fiendish memory, did I
Kill them
I must know

Did I kill them?

Life long friend
Cut off his head

How can this be I butchered them
Why would I slaughter them?
Who gave me this knife to kill them
With, how could I chop them up?

Survey my massacre
Fragments of my comrades carpet
The ground below
I want to escape
Stab myself suicide wake me up and set me free

[Solo: Pat]

Grotesque...mind...grotesque

Did I kill them?
Did I kill them?
