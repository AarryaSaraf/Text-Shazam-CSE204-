Album: Bloodthirst

// Pounded Into Dust //

Forces of hate meet
Gather for the siege
Encircling their foe
The raid begins
Their revenge is sought
Through violence, smashing, killing, stabbing, pounding
Iron weapons clash
Evil warriors strike
Hammers cracking skulls
Axes chopping heads
Their revenge is now
Through violence, crushing, maiming, hacking, pounding

Blood soaks the ground
In their own, they will drown
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust

Battle rages on
Bleeding wounded scream
Clubs shatter bones
Swords sever limbs
Their blind rage compells
Their frenzy, bloodlust, madness, burning, hatred
Berzerkers overwhelm
Defenders run in fear
No prisoners today
The end is near
Their blind age endless
No mercy lay waste, wipe out, kill them, kill them

Their struggle to defend
The attack will never end
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust

The captured will be crucified as a warning to the rest
When the killing is completed the city will be burned
Their way of life will be destroyed, no trace of them remains

Annihilate
They lay waste
Eradicate
Victory for their hatred, fury, raging, pounding

[solo-O'Brien]

Blood soaks the ground
In their own, they will drown
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust

// Dead Human Collection //

I cannot scream, my mouth is wired shut
I cannot see, my eyes are filled with blood
I must die while suffering
Pawn of torturous punishment
Losing all reason to live
Cherishing this painful death
To become part of the

Dead human collection
Dead human collection

I cannot hear with punctured ear drums
I can barely breathe,
My ribs are crushed
I will die while suffering
Maimed, repulsive menagerie
Collection for the insane
Closer to death I become

I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one with the dead
Collection of dead humans, dead
I want to be one of them

Compilation obscene
An assembly for psychotic malefaction
Virulent anarchy
The final member of this vile congregation
I cannot scream, my mouth is wired rot
I cannot see, my eyes turned into dust
I died into the...

// Unleashing The Bloodthirsty //

Dormancy
Spirits await rebirth
From their sleep
They will soon awake
Restless dead
Catching the wiff of hate
Blood they anticipate
They will soon drink
Murderers
Subconscious attraction
On their graves
Blood will now spill
Ancient bones
Reform in grounds below
Born, as the blood will flow
Killing is all they know

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood
Coalesce

Pieces become a whole
For their strength
Blood is absorbed
Rancorous
Aeons of building rage
Death an immortal cage
Now they are freed
Livid beasts
Rising now for revenge
From the past
Hate comes alive
Tenebrous
Restruct evil ones
The demons will come
Cruelity has just begun

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood

First one that they find
Attack the mortal
Claws tear at his face
Pull the flesh from bone
Decapitate the man
They hold his head aloft
Headless body slumps
The blood is gushing out
Screaming victims fall
Repulsive beasts attack
Gore pours from the torso
Hellish creatures stab
Organs, grisly trophies
Rewards for their rage
Blood drips from their jaws
They disembowel the corpse
Kill with speed
Victims bleed
Wretched souls
Headless on poles
Savage thirst
Vesseles burst
Torn apart
Eat the heart
Vengeance taking form
Endless hatred for the living
Plunderng the world
Paroxysm of the damned
Rapture of their rage
Euphoria from butchery
A dark world will eclipse all life
Barbaric ways forever reign

[solos - Owen, O'Brien, Owen, O'Brien]

Blood
They live, they thirst
Blood, blood

// The Spine Splitter //

Fragmentizing, disunite the backbone from the skeleton
Chop the bodies, specialized in customized
Dismemberment
Hatchet wielding, never ending thought of splitered vertebrae
Violent insurgency
Squalid dependancy, ivory interspersion, solace
Riving the arteries, splenetic complacency, somber
Irascible, aggressive ripping head to crotch, life relieving
Propensity, consuming of the spinal cord, dead not living
Animus from perpetual authority, contumacious
Bone displacement surgery
Stagnant, pools of entrails, permeates wretched odors, depraved
Corpses cloven spineless, ultimate pancrea ablate
Violent insurgency, pernicious way of life
Bone displacement surgery, division with an axe

[solo - Owen, O'Brien, Owen, O'Brien]

Fragmentizing
Chop the bodies
Hatchet wielding
The spine splitter

Stagnant, pools of entrails, permeates wretched odors, depraved
Corpses cloven spineless, ultimate pancrea ablate

Fragmentizing
Chop the bodies
Hatchet wielding
The spine splitting will never end

// Ecstacy In Decay //

Immense oceans of gore
Rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth, abnormal wealth
Immenced in a world of decadence

Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure, pervading of viscera
Rejoice in gristly disgust, exorbitant reality
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates

Ecstacy in decay, engrossed in deterioration
Penchant for extreme ordure, pervading of viscera
Rejoice in gristly disgust, exuberant castigation
Wading in bile, soaking in guts, ancient innards

Immense oceans of gore
Rivers of pus, mountains of bones
Rapture, fester in filth
Abnormal wealth immenced in a world of decadence

Mind altered, eternally fetid cadaverous empire, squelched domain
Swamped ruins, dismal necrotic incarnate metropolis
Lost dwelling, exorbitant reality, obfuscated ossuary
One thousand years of compiled waste, frenzy in muck intoxicates

// Raped By The Beast //

Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Unearthly revival of clandestine extinction
Reborn creature, malicious being

Resurgence of a gruesome species
With carnal obsession, it lusts copulation
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell

Infernal quest from a savage of death
Brutal attack, the innocent are unprotected
Hellish fury, deviance provides conception
Vicicious onslaught, its primal lust instinctual
Macabe fuck fest, inside her cunt, the brute's erection

Raped by the beast
Anamialistic, pure hideous appearance
Repulsive re-existence, bearer of morbidity

Ritual, habitual
Black forest of evil, a demons possession
A beast in the wild with nocturnal dementia
Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion
Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell
Raped by the beast

// Coffinfeeder //

Exhume the rotted casket
Robbing graves but not for wealth
Cloaked in moldy rags, hunting dead
Decrepit things from hell

Invade the sacred tombs, search for food
Embalmed five days before
Ancient body stealers raid again
A fresh corpse beyond the door

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them not God they meet

Consume the rotted body and hunt more
Craving maws ooze blood
Gray skinned coffinfeeders seeking carrion
Eat the old ones last

Fiendish ghouls are chewing scraps of meat
Found inside the tomb
Roy veiled messengers from beyond
Bring the parish doom

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them, not God they meet

Unholy creatures swarming the coffin
Fighting for mouthfuls of flesh
Invading the tombs of the recently buried, to feast

Starvation of aeons sated tonight
Foraging ghouls consume
Ancient hunger awakened again

Strengthened by blood, the undead attack
Septic beats from the grave
If living approach they are devoured too

Fragments of corpses nourish the pack
Fresh entrails they crave
The coffin is torn open
The zombies start to consume

From the ground they rise
Plundering the grave
When the faithful die
It's them, not God they meet

// Hacksaw Decapitation //

Memory of the insane
Of killing in so many ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them all

Blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated
Rotting flesh scattered around, I feel no remorse
I don't remember my name
Or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly

Extracting the brains from the skulls
My anger evolves with the more heads I deform
Sawing the neck, I am engulfed in fantasy
Chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy

Utterly exacerbated, forever deleterious
Slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood
Tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhor
Beheading sustains my desire, enhancing my primitive mind
Annihilation without reprieving

Memory of the insane
Of killing in so many ways, homicidal
Seeking redemption through rage
With hacksaws I decapitated them at will

Predacious, violent killing spree
Abolished, putrescent cadavers
Butchered in excrement, sordid obscurity
Feverish hunger to inhale the stench of their death

// Blowtorch Slaughter //

Scourged through searing
Incandescence
Melt together
Fire torture brings me intense pain
Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling

Blowtorch slaughter
Bodily capitulation
Blowtorch slaughter
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Conflagration through my veins
Desensitized, charring skin, burnt within,
branded soul, torrid cruelity
Dwidle away, glowing heat to mutilate
Head set ablaze, consumed in flames
I burn to the ground
Blowtorch slaughter

[Solo - Owen, O'Brien]

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold as one as my blood is boiling
Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Fire torture takes me to my end

// Sickening Metamorphosis //

Change has begun
After the shape
Freakish events
Led to this change
Convert the man
From the norm

Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis

Twisting flesh
Ghastly face
Pain distress
Mind displace
Twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
Mind displaced as the spirit arose
Hideous one
Adapting fast
New skin grows out
Old skin peels off
Extra limbs sprout
Mutilation

Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis

Shifting bones
Gnarled limbs
Gruesome change
Features grim
Shifting bonestrans forming the framework and the
Gnarled limbs are beginning to grow
Gruesome change to repellent appearance
Features grim in complete overthrow
Tentacles extending from the face
Eyes are growing on his hands and back
Spikes and fangs cover his body
Skeleton re-shapes, bones pop and crack

[Solo - O'Brien]

A Monstrous thing he has become
Murderous compulsions flood his mind
Reconstruction reaches completion
He's no longer part of mankind

Alteration
Surreal figure
Misshapen thoughts
Sickening metamorphosis

Twisting flesh
Ghastly face
Pain distress
Mind displace
Twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
Ghastly face of the one that it chose
Pain distress of contortions and straining
Mind displaced as the spirit arose

// Condemned To Agony //

Butchering the helpless
Was his way of life
Uncontrolled rage
Internal strife
The pain he dealt out was never repaid
Retribution was sought by the ones he had slain
Infernal phantasm
Condemned to agony
No escape after death
Condemned to agony
Heads of his victims
Have returned to haunt
Dripping with blood
Rotted and gaunt
The pain is reflected to him after death
With the victims of his knife, he is now beset
Reliving every crime
Condemned to agony
No escape from their hate
Condemned to agony, agony
He thought he got away
His crimes unpunished he took them to the grave
Their tortured souls are waiting
Now they make him pay
Exact their revenge using methods that he used
To make him understand them

To chop him up
Is their revenge
With no remorse
They slash him, disfigure

Undying hate
His torment endless
He's torn apart and they cut the pieces smaller
The knife he used to maim
Is turned against him and now they will do the same
Dissect the man of evil
His fingers are cut off
And forced into his mouth so that he cannot scream
And in pain they revel

[Solo - Owen]

To chop him up
Is their revenge
With no remorse
They slash him, disfigure

Abomination
Their creation
The man who killed them is now scattered
In the abyss

[Solo - O'Brien]

Infernal phantasm
Condemned to agony
No escape after death
Condemned to agony

[Solo - O'Brien]
