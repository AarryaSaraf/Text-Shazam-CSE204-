// Murderous Rampage //

Kill at will, a lust for death
The attic filled with foul odors
Rising up from the basement

Stale blood-drained bodies rotting
Once alive, now forgotten
Slaughtered for no fucking reason

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Slicing of their throats was random
Brutal ways to die

Slayed in horrid vicious manners
Ending lives is all that mattered
Torturing for the pleasure

Dismembered corpses on display
Trophies of pure evil carnage
Putrid means to be remembered

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Stabbing of their hearts was random
Brutal ways to die

Violence unimagined, lasted for days
Perverted celebration
Cruelty unforeseen, driven by hate
Gruesome fascination

Violence reimagined, immoral praise
Vile executions
Savagery unleashed, onslaught of depravity
Abnormal retribution

Finished with the massacre
The thought of bloodshed still remains
More humans must be terminated

Sharpen up the blades again
Insanity will have no end
The butchering will never stop

Many to be murdered frantic
Innocent victims silenced
Smashing of their heads was random
Brutal ways to die

Violence unimagined, lasted for days
Perverted celebration
Cruelty unforeseen, driven by hate
Gruesome fascination

Violence reimagined, immoral praise
Vile executions
Savagery unleashed, onslaught of depravity
Abnormal retribution

Murderous rampage

Kill at will, a lust for death
The attic filled with foul odors
Rising up from the basement

Stale blood-drained bodies rotting
Once alive, now forgotten
Slaughtered for no fucking reason

Murderous rampage

// Necrogenic Resurrection //

Sacrificial victims, slaughtered en masse
Thrown in the pit with his bones
Blood will seed the rebirth
Our lord will rise, materialize

Undying evil
Immortal sin
Almighty killer avenged
They will die
He will rise
Reanimate through homicide

Necrogenic resurrection

Essence of our leader exists in the dust
Into the hole they are cast
Feed, regeneration
Our cult provides, death giving life

Horrific worship
The freshly slain
Bleed on the ground where he lies
They will die
He will rise
Reanimate through homicide

Necrogenic resurrection
Assimilate
Death giving life
Necrogenic resurrection
Mutilate
Life giving death

Up from the earth
Born again from blood
Ascend with violence
Corporeal once more

The grasping hand, abomination surging forth
Atrocities, compulsive mutilation reigns
Massacre perpetuates the evil madness
His brutal murders are a bloodbath preordained

Disembodied evil again is made whole
Slaughter ensues in his wake
Death will feed his vengeance
Stabbing with knives, gouging their eyes

Barbaric madness
He kills again
Shredded flesh covers the ground
All will die
Genocide
Merciless butcher arise

Necrogenic resurrection
Necrogenic resurrection
Necrogenic resurrection

// Inhumane Harvest //

Twisted criminal underground
Subjugation of the victim
For complete control
Reaping vital body parts
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold

Sliced wide open, right down the chest
Removal of the organs
Cut the arteries and veins
Everything must go
Before the victim dies
Burn the body to dispose
Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Sliced wide open, right down the chest
Removal of the organs
Cut the arteries and veins
Everything must go
Before the victim dies
Burn the body to dispose
Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Inhumane harvest
Subjugation of the victims
For complete control
Inhumane harvest
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold

Numbers of the missing rise
While their profit multiplies
So many lives erased
Covert genocide
Numbers of the missing rise
While their profit multiplies
So many lives erased
Covert genocide

Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Inhumane harvest
Subjugation of the victims
For complete control
Inhumane harvest
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold

// Condemnation Contagion //

Upsurge of plague
Fear the unknown
Impaired by pathosis
Afflicted by death and engagement in horror
Sickness abound
Terror defined
Germophobic daymare

Clusters of pain
Grim outlook proclaimed
Infected by illness
Mutations now propagate syndromes of ailment
Ordained confinement
Sustained isolation
Mysophobic nightmare begins

Hallows of death surround me
Feeding my fears of the end
Protocol overboding
Mandatory quarantine enforced

As the powers begin to employ
Invasive measures arbitrarily enact
The imposing ominous presence of order
Amidst the insurrection of deniability

Condemnation contagion
The virus of septicity
Pandemic panic
Endemic unease
The outbreak of human respiratory disease

Condemnation contagion
Transmission through proximity
Global terror
Pathogenic disease
The widespread epidemic of social unease

Is this the end of all that we know?
The evolutionary tale of natural selection
The ultimate mechanism of devolution
The inevitable order of things

Overcome by cataclysmic dread
Deluged by trepidation and despair

Condemnation contagion
The virus of septicity
Pandemic panic
Endemic unease
The outbreak of human respiratory disease

Condemnation contagion
Transmission through proximity
Global terror
Pathogenic disease
The widespread epidemic of social unease
Condemnation contagion

Accursed we are
Damned till the end
So mote it be

Afflicted we are
Doomed till the end
So mote it be

// Surround, Kill, Devour //

Desperation
Starvation drives the pack
Society
Suffered full collapse

Desolation
The world we knew is lost
Consumption of their fellow man
The line that they now cross

Surround, kill, devour
The need for food compels
Lupine instincts, long suppressed now help them to survive

Surround, kill, devour
They run their quarry down
The weakest have been singled out to kill

Shadowing
They're following the tracks
Ambushing
Too late to react
Atavism
From our barbaric past
Reemergence of our darkest side
The violent traits of man

Surround, kill, devour
The victims run in fear
Cunning teamwork boxed them in, there will be no escape

Surround, kill, devour
Slaughter has begun
Cannibals will tear the flesh from bone

Torn apart
Famine fueled madness, they fight for scraps
Savagery

They live on
Rewarded with survival for their evil ways
The virtuous
Will die

Closing in on their chosen target
They force their prey to run
Encircled by the killers

Exhaust the quarry with the constant pressure
The weakest won't survive
The weakest will feed the pack
The weakest will feed the pack

Surround, kill, devour
The need for food compels
Lupine instincts, long suppressed now help them to survive

Surround, kill, devour
They run their quarry down
The weakest have been singled out to kill

Torn apart
Famine fueled madness, they fight for scraps
Savagery

They live on
Rewarded with survival for their evil ways
The virtuous will die

// Ritual Annihilation //

Mangled arms and legs are tied and bound
Ritual execution for the ages
Bodies ripped open while forced to stay alive
From the backbone down to the loins

Father of the furious legion of gods
I offer my sacrifice upon you
As fearsome as you are divine
God of war I honor thee

Ribs, lungs, intestines now pulled out
Carved into the shape of bloody wings
Savagely tortured with a gruesome horrid fate
Yet even uttered, meant the sound of death

The method of torture wielding terrifying pain
Ghastly act of ceremonial torment
Methodically separated and extracted broken ribs
Leaving your organs on full display

Father of the furious legion of gods
I offer my sacrifice upon you
As fearsome as you are divine
God of death I honor thee

With sheer ferocity
With blood on my hands
I bestow upon you this offering
Seeking vengeance, I commit such hideous acts

Stabbing the heels of the helpless victims
Threading the rope through the gaping holes
Forcing the bodies to be hung upside down
As the blood runs down past their hearts

Abdomen sliced open
Viscera then torn out
Feverishly wrapped around the tree
The lacerations of the flesh
Bound to pain eternally
As the wounds now bleed forevermore

Arise arise arise arise
Arise in honor of our ancestors

Arise arise
Arise in ode to our gods

// Follow The Blood //

Poised and ready to strike
Anticipation of the hunt drawing near
Fueled by hatred and spite
If this don't kill them it will fill them with fear
Opposing forces now retreat on the run
They got their asses handed to them hours ago
Now in pursuit of the survivors who fled
Closing the gap soon many more will be dead

Attrition breaking the enemy
Detecting tracks, begin the hunt

Where is their savior now?
Where do they hide? Follow the blood
Nothing can save them now
They will be found, follow the blood

Enemy spotted, converge, fire at will
Fire at will

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one
Fire at will

Where is their savior now?
Where do they hide? Follow the blood
Nothing can save them now
They will be found, follow the blood

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Violent incursion
Dominance will prevail
Sent to exterminate
Taking them down one by one

Fire at will

// Bound And Burned //

Born into a life of contempt and disorder
Living in squalor
Childhood and adolescence filled with abuse
Verbal, mental and physical

A lifetime of pain
Forced into darkness and feelings of shame
This will never happen again
Unforeseen vengeance will end this today
Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it
Knocked unconscious to the ground
Beat down, never to rise again

Arms and legs are tied up tight
Trapped, no chance of escape

Now regaining consciousness
Drenched with the stench of gasoline

The one who caused the suffering
Now begging for forgiveness in vain

Lighting the fire erasing the past
Death will be slow and painful
Burning in flames

Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it
Born into a life of contempt and disorder
Living in squalor
Childhood and adolescence filled with abuse
Verbal, mental and physical

A lifetime of pain
Forced into darkness and feelings of shame
This will never happen again
Unforeseen vengeance will end this today
Violent intentions have surfaced
Now it's too late to reverse it

Bound and burned
Lighting the fire erasing the past

// Slowly Sawn //

Bound tight to the table
Unable to scream
The blades of the sadist
Are all I see

Meticulous slaughter
A saw for each limb
Cuts through my flesh

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn

Dissection resuming
After hours alone
One leg is severed
And thrown to the ground

The madman is silent
While pushing the blades
Jagged edge rips

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn

Protracted slaughter
Slowly cut apart
Every day another stroke
Serrated edge slicing
Through tendons and bone

Prolonged incisions
His job is almost done
Sawtooth surgeon cuts
Dismemberment
Limbs hang from hooks

Every day brings torture
Methodical pain
Slowly sawn into pieces, slowly sawn
Burning staunches torn veins
Slowly sawn

// Overtorture //

As I lie upon a bed of nails
Handcuffed, strapped, and bound to iron rails
Now rendered dead as my organs fail
Thus, pain exists inside this netherworld of fate

The shooting pain now begins to swarm
Engulfing me within a blaze of storm
Annihilation from the chloroform
This agony will only cease when I am gone
Gone

Shall I overcome this tragedy?
As I am ravaged through in blasphemy
Conjured suffering of savagery
This agony will only cease when I am gone
Gone

Agonizing, terrifying, excruciating horrid ghastly pain

Separated, lacerated, castrated, sundered severed limbs
Sheer torture
Unbridled torment

Contaminated, mutilated, disassembled scattered smothered flesh

Decapitated, desecrated, exterminated rancid rotting corpse

As the knife is plunged ever so deep
The bleakness of my reality strengthens
Must my fate be of eternal sleep?
The actualization of my death is near

Overtorture
Overtorture

// Cerements Of The Flayed //

Buried alive wrapped in skin
From another human
That is still alive

Why must I die this way?

Draped in a blood-soaked covering
My suffering a mystery

In the ground barely conscious
Unknown graveyard of the ancients
Is where it all will end

Sacrificial tomb of torment
Excruciating pain to covet
Obtain a new eternal home

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Unburied to live wrapped in skin
From another human
That was still alive

Why didn't I die this way?

Draped in a blood-soaked covering
My suffering a mystery

Up from the ground barely conscious
A new chapter is upon us
When will it all end?

Must endure the grisly torment
Exhilarating pain to covet
Obtain a new external hide

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Shaved of my own pelt
Replaced ceremoniously
Salvaged from oblivion
Regained life through atrocity
Repulsively existing
Perpetual form of agony
Scraped into an endless hell
Sliced meticulously

Exterior invasion
Sickening form of misery
Succumbing to the mayhem
Shocking all humanity

Wearing the shroud made of membrane
Cerements of the flayed
Cloaked in the peeled epidermis
Cerements of the flayed

Of the flayed
Of the flayed
Of the flayed
Of the flayed
