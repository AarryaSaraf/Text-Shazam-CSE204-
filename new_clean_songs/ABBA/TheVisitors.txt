Album: TheVisitors

// The Visitors //

I hear the door-bell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me...

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling...

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm 
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me...
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm 
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm 
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm 
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

// Head Over Heels //

I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, "That's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry"
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
(She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)
And she goes
Head over heels

// When All Is Said And Done //

Here's to us
One more toast
And then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us
Can feel the autumn chill

Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over
And the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

In our lives we have walked
Some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified
And not too old for sex

We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love
And thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

It's so strange, when you're down
And lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head
Get up and ask for more

Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done

// Soldiers //

Do I hear what I think I'm hearin'?
Do I see the signs, I think I see?
Or is this just fantasy

Is it true that the beast is wakin'?
Stirrin' in his restless sleep tonight in the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothin' in the world was wrong

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way, takin' a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear?
In the distance but drawin' near

Is it only a storm approachin'?
All that thunder and the blinding light in the winter night
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothin' in the world was wrong

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way, takin' a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way, takin' a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

// I Let The Music Speak //

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak

// One Of Us //

They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know
One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call

// Two For The Price Of One //

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say
At least not until the day
When something special he read
This is what it said:

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)

He called the number and a voice said, "Alice Whiting"
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what I read"
This is what it said:

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two)
For the price of one...

She said, "I'm sure we must be perfect for each other
And if you doubt it you'll be certain when you meet my mother"

// Slipping Through My Fingers //

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

// Like An Angel Passing Through My Room //

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged good-bye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room

// Should I Laugh Or Cry //

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

He's (he's) dressed (dressed) in the striped pajamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives (gives) me (me) of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

Strange (strange) how (how) dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No (no) more (more) pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

// I Am The City //

Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me here I am my arms are open wide

Somewhere in the middle of the neverending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be

People feed me with their lives I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be

I am the city
You let me be
I am the city

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me

[Last line is sung simultaneously with next line]

Coming through a cloud
You're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes

[Last line is sung simultaneously with next line]

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
Yes I am the city you let me be

And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size

[Last line is sung simultaneously with next line]

The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city

You let me be

Somewhere in the middle of the neverending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats

[Last line is sung simultaneously with next line]

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
Yes I am the city you let me be

And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets

[Last line is sung simultaneously with next line]

The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city

You let me be

// You Owe Me One //

Now there's a shadow passing over our faces
Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while we'll have to pick up the traces
We won't find the missing parts.
Buy me a ticket I'll go to the Bahamas
I need a rest from our petty little dramas
Yes I really do

Aha um hum
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun,
Baby you owe me one.
Aha un hum
It's my turn to run
A chance to see the sun,
Baby you owe me one.

I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion
I was taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation on our hearts.
Something unwanted has entered our existence
I think it's better to view it from a distance
Yes I really do

Aha um hum
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun,
Baby you owe me one.
Aha un hum
It's my turn to run
A chance to see the sun,
Baby you owe me one.

// Cassandra //

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed

Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us could
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

I'm sorry Cassandra
I'm sorry Cassandra

// Under Attack //

Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how

Now this is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Cause waiting at the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking...

// The Day Before You Came //

I must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

// From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel //

Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are 
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky 
Seems to me you shine your light 
Down to me to say goodnight 
Twinkle twinkle my old friend 
Sleep is waiting round the bend 
While you travel through the Milky Way 
From afar 
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

Raindrops on a window pane 
Stillness of a summer rain 
Silently the haze drifts through the trees 
Slowly dawn is breaking through 
Yet a morning without you

Curtains rustling in the breeze 
I'm still trapped within my dreams 
Daylight makes its way into my mind 
Coming through 
Yet another morning without you

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Echoes of a voice I knew...

Half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All to soon 
Like an angel passing through my room

Long awaited darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace 
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All too soon 
Like an angel passing through my room
