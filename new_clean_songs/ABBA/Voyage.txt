// I Still Have Faith In You //

I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years that faith lives on, somehow

There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way

But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived

And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived

And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

(I still have faith in you)
And we still have it in us
We've only just arrived
(Do I have it in me?)
We stand on a summit
Humble and grateful
To have survived

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?

// When You Danced With Me //

I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, "I'll return next year"
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

So is the outside world as you imagined?
Was it worth it, severing the ties?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

When you danced with me

I miss the good old times when you danced with me

// Little Things //

Little things
Like my gentle touch
It's amazing, darling
That so little can achieve so much

Little things
Like your sleepy smile
As the brand new day is dawning
It's a lovely Christmas morning

And why don't we stay in bed for a while
Soon enough they'll be waking up from their dreams
Children bursting with giggles and screams
Oh, what joy Santa brings
Thanks, old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Little things
Like your naughty eyes
You'd consider bringing me a breakfast tray
But there's a price

Little things
Like that happy noise
As a brand new day is dawning
On this lovely Christmas morning

It's our children playing with their new toys
Little moments of happiness and of bliss
Does it ever get better than this?
Oh, what joy Santa brings
Thanks, old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Thank you, dear old friend, for packing
Christmas stockings full of nice little things

Little things
Like the precious jewels on rings
Or a music box that will fit in socks
Tiny elves with wings
Not as big as queens and their kings
If you sing along, it could be a song
That my grandma sings

// Don't Shut Me Down //

A while ago I heard the sound of children's laughter
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark

I realize I'm cold
The rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know

I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left I felt I'd had enough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I have learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down

I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind
I'm not the same this time around
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all
I got to say I'm glad
Once these rooms were witness to our love
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad
To not so bad in my transformation

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down

I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind now
I'm not the same this time around
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

You asked me not to leave
Well, here I am again
And I love you still and so I won't pretend
I have learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

// Just A Notion //

Just a notion, that's all
Just a funny feeling deep inside (A-ha-ha)
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone
And you wonder if I'm occupied (A-ha-ha)
So you're hesitating

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from thereon must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
There's something happening that I just can't explain
If I try it's all in vain because it's

Just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me (A-ha-ha)
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me (A-ha-ha)
There is no mistaking

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from thereon must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny, there's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special
It's a night for me and you

(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
I, I think it's more than a notion (A-ha-ha)
Give me more than you're dreaming, step up to the truth
(A-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

// I Can Be That Woman //

You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, "Screw you!"
I say, "I love you!"
And I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God! I'm sorry for the wasted years

(Not the one I could have been)
You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

// Keep An Eye On Dan //

I know that this shouldn't be
A traumatic event, but it is
And I feel so bad
My little boy looks so happy
He throws me his "go-mummy" kiss
And he loves his dad
And I've loved him too
Maybe I still do
But, it's over

Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back at on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan

Certain that I'm out of sight
I pull over and turn off the car
And I bang the wheel
I can't believe that I've actually
Held it together this far
Seeing how I feel
But I said good-bye
And I did not cry
Though my heart ached

Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back at seven on Sunday to get him

I, I think he must have lost some weight
Funny how it takes me back to our first date

So keep an eye on Dan

Keep an eye on Dan
You're a loving man
Make an effort not to upset him
Just keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan

// Bumblebee //

He likes the lilacs in my garden
I love to watch him fly
He's just a tiny, fuzzy ball
And I wonder how he can fly at all

A world without him
I dread to think what that would be
And I imagine my distress
It would be a new kind of loneliness

But for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling carefree as I listen
To the hum of bumblebees

It's quite absurd this summer morning
To think we could be trapped
Inside a world where all is changing
Too fast for bumblebees to adapt

From thyme to bluebell
From hyacinth to lily rose
Oh, how I do adore the sight
Of his rather clumsy, erratic flight

And for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling carefree as I listen
To the hum of bumblebees

Yes, for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling sad for those who'd never
Hear the hum of bumblebees

Oh, yes, for now, I'm in my garden
Watching clouds sail with the breeze
Feeling sad for those who'd never
Hear the hum of bumblebees

// No Doubt About It //

I messed it up, alright
And there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight
Cause I'd go mad without it

Bending like a willow when a storm is brewing
Oh yeah, that's you
But, hey, I take the rap
This one's my mishap
And there's no doubt about it

He tells me that he won't take the bait
That I have a tendency to exaggerate
And maybe he's right, but that is beside the point
Well, then why do I let it upset me?
Yes, and why am I biting my nails?

I made a mess this time
And there's no doubt about it
Hands down, the fault is mine
And I'm prepared to shout it

Out across the rooftops if it makes you happy
Oh, yes, I could
So, hey, I take the blame
This one's got my name
And there's no doubt about it

He says with forbearance in his eyes
Most couples we know are able to compromise
He's too good for me, that's one thing I know for sure
If that's true, why do I let it upset me?
There I go, stomping my feet like a child

But he is a good man
He tries to understand why I freak out
He worries, and I know, it's an honest reaction

I messed it up, alright
And there's no doubt about it
I had to pick this fight
I'd have gone mad without it
Hissing like a wild cat when I should be purring
But you know me
This isn't where it ends
I could make amends
And there's no doubt about it (This isn't where it ends)
No doubt about it (This isn't where it ends)
No doubt about it (This isn't where it ends)

// Ode To Freedom //

If I ever write my
Ode to Freedom
It will be in prose that chimes with me
It would be a simple
Ode to Freedom
Not pretentious, but with dignity
I would like to think that freedom is
More than just a word
In grand and lofty language
Odes to Freedom often go unheard

If I ever wrote my
Ode to Freedom
Being privileged and spoilt for choice
Then I fear that you would
Be suspicious
Of the cause to which I'd lend my voice
It's elusive and it's hard to hold
It's a fleeting thing

That's why there is no Ode to Freedom truly worth remembering
I wish someone would write an Ode to Freedom that we all could sing
