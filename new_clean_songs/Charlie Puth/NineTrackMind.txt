// Marvin Gaye //

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's Kama Sutra show and tell (yeah)
Whoa
There's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(Ooh, it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle
(It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble
(I'm in trouble)
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Meghan Trainor:]
And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you, babe
Whoa
There's loving in your eyes
That pulls me closer
(Ooh, it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle
(It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble
(I'm in trouble)
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Ooh, baby, I got that healing that you want, yeah
Like they say it in the songs
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, babe
You got to give it up to me
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in a song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Ooh

// Some Type Of Love //

When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone, whoa oh
Every single moment will be fading into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you, whoa oh
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When we're old and gray
And our faces changed, whoa oh
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

And every story ends, eh
But we could still pretend, yeah eh
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire we won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

// One Call Away //

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance

No matter where you go
Know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we can stay here for a while
'Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

And when you're weak I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one, I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

I'm only one call away

// Dangerously //

This is gonna hurt
But I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love
It fucked my head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold
The power with both
My hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire
I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously

Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously

// Losing My Mind //

I'm run, yeah, oh yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

It's funny how I got just exactly what I want
I'll try to have fun some other time
I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush
I'll try to go find some other high

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
But I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

So much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

I'm sorry that I'm not there to give you what you want
I'll think about us some other time
And I'm sorry that I can't be the perfect type of man
I'll think about us some other time

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah like my mind

I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind

// We Don't Talk Anymore //

[Charlie Puth:]
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been lookingâ€”
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez:]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez:]
That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

We don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight, oh
If he's holding onto you so tight, oh
The way I did before

We don't talk anymore

I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game, oh
Now I can't get you out of my brain, whoa
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore

// My Gospel //

I'd stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
And walk out with a million bucks
Then I'd burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
Just to prove it didn't mean that much
I'd sell everything I own, take a pile of cash
Walk into the casino, bet it all on black
Then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
To make out with you in the back, hey

I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy about you

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me

I'd buy a couple red-eye one-way tickets to Paris doing first class ride
Then I'd carry your body to the top of the tower to kiss your lips at midnight
Then we'll wander through the streets, and drink champagne
Get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
I'll a capella karaoke "Sexy Thing", 'cause, baby, I feel no shame
Say this whole world can know you're all I need
'Cause, baby, some day I'll drop and hit one knee and tell you

I'm not afraid to change your name
'Cause I'm crazy about you

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me

Throw myself out of a jet airplane
Hundred feet a second just screaming your name
I'd steal a cop car turn the blue lights on
Pick you up and drive it around 'til dawn
I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy about you

Oh, oh, oh I'm not afraid to look insane
'Cause I'm crazy, crazy, crazy

There's nothing that I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I'm all but shameless
Need you and I couldn't care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl there's nothing I won't do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me,
Baby

// Up All Night //

Well I get the thrill run down my spine
When I see you hitting me up
Feeling so electrified
Like the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

So I try to shake you out my head
Try to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice, you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playing over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

How you're reeling me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

// Left Right Left //

Oh I been hurting lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

Hmmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Hmmm, I'm moving on, I got no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right, left

I said times are changing, tell me how can I keep up
Every time I turn around there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted
And you're lost without me
Yeah you gotta walk alone, yeah it's true
Flash every smile cause I've been lost for miles
Cause, yeah, I know you've felt this way before too

Hmmm, we're almost there baby one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Hmmm, we're moving on, we got no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left

Hmmm...
I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We're almost there baby one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving forward and there's no regrets
Oh, left, right, left, right
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, left, right, left, right, left
Oh, we're almost there only one more step
Oh, left, right, left, right, left

// Then There's You //

Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed
Some girls be craving that attention to be seen
But the one I'm looking at is right in front of me

There's no words to express
When you're wearing that dress that way
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you

Some girls, they hit me up saying, "What you doing now?"
But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wondering why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me now

There's no words to express
When you're wearing that dress that way
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you

Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed

There's beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
Did you know you're beautiful, baby?
There's beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
I know there is beautiful and then there's you
There's beautiful and then there's you

// As You Are //

[Charlie Puth:]
Thinking back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days baby you were the truth
And nothing you could do would ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts don't forget what they do
But somewhere down the line I left you hanging
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend, I'll never break your heart again

Cause I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are

You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing more nothing less you're the real
I wanna take this time to thank you baby
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend, I'll never break your heart again

Cause I, I will always love you
Baby I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
(I will always love you)
Baby I could never judge you
(I could never judge you)
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are

[Shy Carter:]
So let it be known now
You're queen to my throne now
It's you at all times
I'll never reject you
I'll love and respect you
'Cause you're my lifeline
Only thing on my wishlist
You love and forgiveness
For that I will climb
(Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times)
Why would I fight it?
I know that it's right when you're holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I'll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I'm yours
You know that I'm yours

[Charlie Puth:]
Cause I, I will always love you
(I will always love you)
Baby I could never judge you
(I could never judge you)
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
(Darling I will always love you
I will always love you)
Baby I could never judge you
I'd take you as you are, are, are, are, are

// See You Again //

[Charlie Puth:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

[Charlie Puth:]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Wiz Khalifa:]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Charlie Puth:]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

// Does It Feel //

Tell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

And girl I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

Whoa, girl I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone (Don't hang up the phone)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you're never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
