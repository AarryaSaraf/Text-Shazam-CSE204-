// Sea Of Tranquility //

I live in the light of the bright silver moon
I'll take you off sailing from midnight till noon
I'll show the Sea of Tranquility
You can have any flavor you happen see
I live in the shade of a forest of green
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails

There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs

There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care

So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by
Come down around midnight and give us a try
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility
You can have any flavor you happen to see

// Ghosts Of Cape Horn //

All around old Cape Horn
Ships of the line, ships of the morn
Some who wish they'd never been born
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn

Fal deral dal riddle de rum
With a rim dim diddy
And a rum dum dum
Sailing away at the break of dawn
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn 

See them all in sad repair
Demons dance everywhere
Southern gales, tattered sails
And none to tell the tales 

Come all of you rustic old sea dogs
Who follow the bright Southern Cross
You were rounding the Horn
In the eye of a storm
When you lost her one day
And you read all your letters
From oceans away
Then you took them to the bottom of the sea 

All around old Cape Horn
Ships of the line, ships of the morn
Some who wish they'd never been born
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn 

Fal deral dal riddle de rum
With a rim dim diddy
And a rum dum dum
Sailing away at the break of dawn
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn 

Come all you old sea dogs from Devon
Southampton, Penzance, and Kinsale
You were caught by the chance
Of a sailor's last dance
It was not meant to be
And you read all your letters
Cried anchors aweigh
Then you took them to the bottom of the sea 

All around old Cape Horn
Ships of the line, ships of the morn
Some who wish they'd never been born
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn 

Fal deral dal riddle de rum
With a rim dim diddy
And a rum dum dum
Sailing away at the break of dawn
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn

// Dream Street Rose //

You've bin in all my dreams since you've been gone
Each mornin' that I wake up with the dawn
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while 
You gave more than anyone could ask
You washed away all shadows from my past
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes
Dream Street Rose let us not pretend
Heaven knows will you love me
Right 'til the end 

Somewhere in between there stands a dream
The sweetest dream that we have ever seen
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose please stay with me a while
Dream Street Rose I miss you when you're gone
Heaven knows I'm gonna love ya
From now on 

Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes

// On The High Seas //

Was it someone she met that's so hard to forget
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes
I don't remember where she said she would be
And since I don't know, let me guess 
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome
And when all is said and done
Will she leave me alone 

I don't want to get so low
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes
I don't remember where she said she would be
Back in the city or on the high seas 

Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind
North of the border or down in South Bend
And when all is said and done
Is there no rainbow's end 

I don't want to own the key
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free
I don't remember where she said she would go
Straight for the highway or down the low road
I don't remember where she said she would be
Back in the city or on the high seas

// Whisper My Name //

Travel with me if you choose
Into a land of notions
Through the ruins of yesteryear
Set yer mind in motion
Be beside me win or lose
I will no forsake thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 
I will build a home for you
To keep you warm each winter
Lemon lilies at your door
To give you in September
I will take you as you stand
I promise to defend thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Whisper my name as you pass through my life
Whisper my name when you fall
I'm just a dusty old mem'ry ya trust
I'll be close by when you call 

Give and take ain't always so
Seeing is believing
Down and out don't stop the show
Staying is not leaving
What we say ain't always so
But I won't deceive thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Talk to me, run to me, whisper my name
Don't waste your love makin' friends
We've both had enough of that wonderful stuff
It's too easy to sin 

Travel with me if you choose
Into a land of notions
Through the ruins of yesteryear
Set yer mind in motion
Be beside me win or lose
I will no forsake thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Travel with me if you choose
I promise to protect thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me
Now will you go with me

// If You Need Me //

If you want to know all reasons 
For the things I feel inside
You can run away and hide 
If you want to
But if you need me
Show me a way to get through
'Cause I've not see anyone like you
Since I was a man 

If you want to know for certain 
What is written in my soul
Where my wildest dreams unfold
Like an endless stream
If you need me
Show me a way to walk tall
'Cause I've not seen anything at all
Until I met you 

Sun lights up the seasons
Blue eyes light up the night 
If you want to know the meaning 
Of these feelings, that's all right
I could be with you tonight
That's where I'd like to stay
If you need me
Show me a love that is true
'Cause I've not seen a woman like you
Since I was a man 

If you want to know what magic 
Lies beneath the haloed moon
In each corner of each room
Where my love has strayed
If you need me
Show me a way to walk tall
'Cause I've not seen anything at all
Until I met you

If you need me
Show me a way to get through
'Cause I've not seen anything like you
Since I was a man

// Hey You //

Hey you upon this ship of fools
I have found you bending your own rules
Thank you I don't mind if I do
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew 
There was such a flaming time
I never will forget
It was all so easy then
This is my one regret 

Hey you my angel in blue
Mother Nature saved her best for you
Green grow the lilacs on the wall
Heaven help them, catch them as they fall 

Hey you angel in disguise
What is your angle what is your surprise
Hey you fever that is mine
What is your game plan what is your design 

Reality brings mystery
And ne'er the twain shall meet
And all of my wild horses
Cannot pull you off your feet 

Hey you angel on my mind
All around me til the end of time
Thank you I don't mind if I do
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew 

There was such a flaming time
I never will forget
It was all so easy then
This is my one regret 

Hey you my angel in blue
I'm entangled tell me what to do
Green grow the lilacs on the wall
Heaven help them catch them as they fall

// Make Way For The Lady //

Some life I've been livin'
Like a song in the night
Good sounds every moment
Good news and bright lights
Anytime I get lonesome
I just got to do the things right

Make way for the lady
You can do it my son
Makin' hay with no gravy
Brings the good folk down
Anytime you get lonely
You just got to turn it around

This life I've been given
It don't tell you no lies
Could've been somewhat wasted
How could it be otherwise
When the sound of the laughter
Brought the tears into my eyes

Make way for the lady
You can do it my son
Makin' hay with no gravy
Gets the day's work done
When a blue mood gets rollin'
You just got to turn it around
Turn it around

Shake hands with the father
The son and the holy ghost
The impossible believers
And the heavenly host
If you must do it better
You just got to do it the most

Make way for the lady
You can do it my son
Makin' hay with no gravy
Brings all the good folk down
When a blue moon starts risin'
You just got to turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around

Make way for the lady
Turn it around

// Mister Rock Of Ages //

Mister Rock of Ages you got time on your hands
Got no worries, got no plans
Bless my soul now you're doin' fine
You ain't got no axe to grind 
Rock of Ages tell me where does it stand
Are we bound for the promised land
Bless my soul, I ain't ready to die
And my future is in your hands 

Mister Rock of Ages you've been goin' on strong
Since time began, til time is done
And so the tide shall run 

Mister Rock of Ages tell me what do you see
Are we bound for eternity
Bless my soul, baby you're doin' fine
You ain't got no axe to grind 

Rock of Ages you've got nothing to hide
Got no ego, got no pride
Bless my soul, let me do what I can
For my future is in your hands 

Mister Rock of Ages, the lord of my lease
In times of toil and times of peace
Until my song shall cease 

Mister Rock of Ages, I'm a part of you now
I am yours, you belong to be
Bless my soul, let me do what I can
For my future is in your hands

// The Auctioneer //

Hey y've all reg'stered, open the gate 'n let 'em out and walk 'em 'bout.
Ere we come a letter number twenty-nine, what're you gonna gimme for 'er

Gotta twenty-five dollar bidja-biddle on a five on the five wouldja biddle on a
thirty dollar five on a five would ya biddle on a five wouldja biddle on a thirty five.

Well there was a boy from Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his Ma
when she told him that he should go to school.
Well He'd stay away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
you'd find him at the local auction barn.
Well, he'd stand and listen carefully until at last he began to see
how the auctioneer could talk so rapidly,
Well, he said "Oh my, it's do or die, I've got to learn that auction cry,
gonna make my mark and be an auctioneer."

Twenty-five dollar bid'ja, now, thirty dollar, thirty wudja make it thirty
bidda onna thirty dollar thirty dollar wouldja gimme thirty, wouldja gimme
thirty dollar bill? I gotta thirty dolla bidja, now, five, wouldja beedle onna
thirty five biddle on a thirty five, thirty five? Who's gonna bitta the thirty five dollar bill?

Well the time went by and he did his best and all could see he did not jest.
He practiced calling bids both night and day
till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm
as he tried to imitate the auctioneer.
And his pop said "Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man
selling things at auction using our good name.
Gonna send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
and you can take your place among the best."

Thirty five dolla bidja now forty doller forty, wouldja megga forty bidya on a
forty doller forty doller wouldja gimme forty, wouldja gimme forty dollar bill?
I gotta forty dollar bidya now, five, wouldja biddle on a forty-five, bidgel on
a forty-five, forty-five. Who's gunna bidda the forty-five dollar bill?

And from that boy that went to school there grew a man who played it cool,
he come back home a full fledged auctioneer.
And the people would come from miles around
just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
that filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.
And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and more,
he had to buy a plane to get around.
Well, now he's the best in all the land, let's pause and give that man a
hand 'cause he's the best of all the auctioneers

Forty-five dollar bidja now, fifty dollar fifty wouldja make it fifty biddle
onna fifty dolla fifty dolla. Wouldja gimme fifty, wouldja gimme fifty dolla
bill? I gotta fifty dolla bidja now, five, wouldja biddle onna fifty-five,
biddle onna fifty-five, fifty-five. Who's gonna bitta the fifty five dollar bill?

Well I sold that hoss for fifty dollar bill!
