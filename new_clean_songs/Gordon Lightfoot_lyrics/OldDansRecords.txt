// Farewell To Annabel //

Where did ya go when the snow lay on the ground
What did ya do when the rain began to fall
How did it feel when I looked through your soul
When was the last time you wanted my love 
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden
How could you put yourself through like you did
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way 

Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you
Where does it say love should last forever
When was the last time I told that to you 

Farewell to Annabel, farewell
Farewell to Annabel, farewell
Farewell to Annabel, fare thee well
Farewell to Annabel, farewell

// That Same Old Obsession //

I come to this garden
I come here to rest
Early each day upon risin'
I think of my lost love
From over the sea
And sometimes I've wondered
If she thinks of me 
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart 

There's peace in the garden
There's peace in the air
Peace in the sound of the river
There's peace in the meadow
The sun shines like gold
And if she were with me
There'd be peace in my soul 

I long to return to the place, I remember
The taste of her lips close to mine
I could do much better
If I could be strong
Come into my garden
But leave me alone 

I come to this garden
I come here to rest
Just as the night comes stealin'
Someone is weeping
She's calling my name
Deep in the garden
Deep in my brain 

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart

// Old Dan's Records //

Get out old Dan's records
Get out old Dan's records
We will dance the whole night long
It's fun to play the old time songs
If old Dan could see us now
I know he'd be so proud 
Bring out old Dan's records
Bring out old Dan's records
I remember my Aunt Bea
She'd dance with Dan till two or three
If old Dan could see her now
I know he'd shout out loud 

Dig out old Dan's records
Bring out old Dan's records
We're all here, we've all got dates
We'll dance all night to the seventy-eights
If old Dan could see us now
I know he'd be so proud
If old Dan was with us still
I know he'd come around 

Get out old Dan's records
Dig out old Dan's records
Back to nineteen thirty-five
The foxtrot, jitterbug 'n jive
If old Dan could see us now
I know he'd be so proud 

Get out old Dan's records
Bring out old Dan's records
High above the fireplace
There's a smile on old Dan's face
If old Dan could see us now
I know he'd be so proud
If old Dan was with us still
I know he'd come around

// Lazy Mornin' //

Another lazy mornin'
No need to get down on anyone
My son
Coffee's in the kitchen
Woman on the run
No need to get bothered
I'll think about Monday
When Monday comes
It's two for one
Mister hoot 'n holler
Gotta make a dollar
Another lazy mornin'
I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two
The most delicious brew
Keepin' up with the Joneses
I hope no one telephones us 
I'd take a place in the country
But for now the old back yard
Looks to me like fifty acres
Of the roundest ground in town 

Another lazy mornin'
Come suppertime I'm gonna light my barbecue
Nothin' new
Only that she loves me
And nothin' I know can change me
No need to get bothered
I do more livin' than it might seem
Some dream
Livin' like a pauper
Bless my darlin' daughter 

I'd like to know what makes a man go
Over land and sea
I guess it must get kinda lonesome
That's the way I used to be 

Another lazy mornin'
No need to get down on anyone
Such fun
Coffee's in the kitchen
Woman on the run

// You Are What I Am //

You make the time stand still
You do it now and you always will
You take me as I am
You make me feel like a brand new man 
Every time that I fall down
I never get stuck
You got the combination gal
To get me right back up
'Cause you are what I am
I'm lovin' you forever if I can 

Think about the times we've had
We never been blue
You got the combination gal
To keep me straight and true
'Cause you are what I am
I'm lovin' you forever if I can 

You make the time stand still
You do it now and you always will
You take me as I am
You make me feel like a brand man 

I know I'm lucky too
Without two or three, just me and you
'Cause you are what I am
I'm lovin' you forever if I can

// Can't Depend On Love //

I spent most of my life outside in the drivin' rain
I was only trying to get my with some of life's amenities
Well nothin's free
I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see
I can't depend on love to defend me 
It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong
It was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind
Pretending is for strangers who don't know you 

I spent most of my life outside in the drivin' rain
I was in some one-horse town just waitin' for a plane to take me back
Now where's that at
I paid the price, well ain't that nice
Knowin' I'm so free
I can't depend on love to defend me
I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see
I can't depend on love to defend me

// My Pony Won't Go //

Gotta make your mind up 
Every single day
(I) hate to see you lonely
Losin' me this way 
Lookin' for the man
Who stole my love from me
Gotta know the reason
Why my baby's leavin'
My pony won't go
Where I want him to go no more 

Gotta make your mind up
If you're gonna stay
I don't see no sense in
Anything you say 

Since you met the guy
Who told you I was wrong
You do all the livin'
While I do all the givin'
My pony won't go
He can't find no oats to eat 

Gotta make your mind up
Every single day
(I) hate to see you lonely
Losin' me this way 

Lookin' for the man
Whole stole my love from me
Gotta know the reason
Why my baby's leavin'
My pony won't go
Where I want him to go no more

// It's Worth Believin' //

There's a warm wind tonight
And the moon turns the tide
When the stars take their ride
She'll be leavin'
Where she goes, I don't know
She won't tell me what it is
That makes her act like this
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me
It's worth believin' 
Should I ask
Do you like to go walking on the shore
And listen to the sea
Or could it be someone kind
Could it be that I'm the fool
There's somethin' wrong with you
And I've got a funny feelin' that it's me
It's worth believin' 

There's a breeze from the shore
And the waves overlap
When I've called in the cat
She'll go walkin'
And she cries to herself
In the night when I'm asleep
She lies awake and weeps
Could it be someone new
Some old who has returned
Or is it just a game
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me
It's worth believin' 

There's a warm wind tonight
And the moon turns the tide
When the stars take their ride
She'll be leavin'
Where she goes, I don't know
She won't tell me what it is
That makes her act like this
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me
It's worth believin'

// Mother Of A Miner's Child //

She is my flower
And she blooms for the one who loves her best
The miners stop to watch her when she walks
They know her love is not for sale
She will never fail me 'cause I know
I watched her grow
And the mother of a miner's child
Waits for me beside the kitchen door

She is my light
In this place where the darkness never ends
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend
She's the only one who listens when I tell her 
I got less than I can spend
She knows the pace
Oh mother of a miner's child
Wash away the coal dust from my face 

When the night shift's done
She'll be waiting by the table when I come
Searchin' for another dream to chase
Oh mother of a miner's child
I know that you still think about the day
When we'll be movin' on
Remember dear old Daddy and
The promise that I made to carry on 

Sometimes I smile
In the cage where the cables softly hum
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone
But the mother of a miner's child
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home
Come Saturday
And he is just a miner's boy
I hope that he will find a better way 

She is my flower
And she blooms for the one who loves her best
The miners stop to watch her when she walks
They know her love is not for sale
She will never fail me 'cause I know
I watched her grow
And the mother of a miner's child
Waits for me beside the kitchen door

// Hi'way Songs //

When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday 
I have played on my guitar
In coffeehouses, halls, and bars
Everyone that I call friend
Knows they will not be forgot 

Trains and planes and rented cars
Singers, saints, and other stars
I suspect them every one
They'll never change
It's too much fun 

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there 

When I stand on my own sod
It feels so good to be home, by God
The winter wind has turned my head
But I always came up warm somehow 

Bottles, beads, and cigarettes
And lovers that I ain't found yet
Picking with a friend till dawn
And singing all of those hi'way songs 

Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there 

When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday 

I would travel all my life
If loneliness was not the price
While headin' north across that line's
The only time I'm flyin'
