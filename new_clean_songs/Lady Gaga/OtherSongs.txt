// Animal //

Meow!

You have got a wild side
You're an animal tonight
I see that you are my type
Wild like a tiger hunting your prey
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Hot in the jungle, exotic apparel

I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you, love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

Baby, I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Like an animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave
Animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'm gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal, animal
An animal, animal
I'm gonna tie you up in case you bite
I'm an animal, animal
An animal, animal

I don't mean to blame you, I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal, animal
An animal, animal
I don't mean to blame you, I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal, animal
An animal, animal

You're a hunter feel your way
I'll do whatever you say
Hold me down and take control (mess up my hair, all crazy sexual)
Do it like an animal (hot in the jungle, exotic apparel)

I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you, love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

Baby, I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Like an animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave
Animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'm gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal, animal
An animal, animal
I'm gonna tie you up in case you bite
I'm an animal, animal
An animal, animal

I don't mean to blame you, I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal, animal
An animal, animal
I don't mean to blame you, I'm just trying to tame you
You're an animal, animal
An animal, animal

I can see the way that you're looking at me
Like you're hungry and I am the only thing that you see
Won't tame you, love the way you're watching me
(Watching me)

Baby, I'mma keep you up all night
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Like an animal, animal
Animal, animal
Baby, I'mma lock you in my cage
And I won't stop until you behave

// Baby, It's Cold Outside //

Well, my lady
It's been grand, but I think, I gotta go
(No!)

I really can't stay
(Baby, it's cold outside.)
I've got to go away
(But, baby, it's cold outside.)
This evening has been
(So happy that you dropped in.)
So, very nice
(I'll hold your hands, they feel like ice.)

My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's the hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to fire place roar.)
But really I'd better scurry
Or maybe just a half a drink more
(Put the record on, while I pour.)

But the neighbours might think
(Baby, it's bad out there.)
Say, what's in this drink?
(There ain't any cabs out there.)
I feel as I'm in
(Your eyes are better than sin.)
Some crazy spell
(I love your hair it looks so swell.)

I'd rather say, "No, no, no, sir."
(What if I move in closer?)
At least, I'm gonna say, that I tried
(What's up with the hurt of my pride?)
I really can't stay
Baby
(Ah) Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go
(Baby, it's cold outside.)
The answer is, "No."
(But, baby, it's cold outside.)
I seen this welcome has been
(How lucky that you dropped in.)
So, nice and warm
(Look out the window at that storm.)

My sister, will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious.)
My brother, will be there on the floor
(Waves upon a tropical shore.)
My friends, oh, their minds are vicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious.)
Or maybe just a cigarette more
(Never such a blizzard before.)

I've got to get home
(Baby, you'll freeze out there.)
Why don't you lend me another coat?
(It's up to your knees out there.)
You've really been grand, but can't you see?
(Oh, how you do this thing to me.)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my life long sorrow.)
At least, there will be plenty, implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died.)
I really can't stay
Oh, oh
(Ah) Baby, it's cold outside

// Benny And The Jets //

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
Been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf, tonight
So, stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Oh, say, Candy and Ronnie
Have you seen them yet?
Oh, 'cause they're so spaced out,
G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets (Hey, that's not the words!)
Ooh, they're weird and wonderful
Ooh, Elton he's really keen (She's keen)
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Oh, oh (Come, on!)
G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets!

Hey kids, why don't plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Gaga makes them ageless (Ha, ha!)
We survive, let us take ourselves along (Whoo!)
Where we fight, our parents, out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie
Have you seen them yet?
Oh, 'cause they're so spaced out
G-g-g-Gaga and the Jets
Ooh, Elton it's sweet and wonderful
Ooh, Elton he's really keen
He's got electric boots, a mohair suit
I read it in a magazine
Oh, oh (Come, on!)
E-E-E-Elton/G-G-G-Gaga and the Jets!

Gaga, mother (Oh, ho!)
I love you, baby (Yeah-ha!)

// Blueberry Kisses //

Yeah

Blueberry kisses
My lips, they miss his, oh, yeah
Where did you go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd love you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around

I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)
'Round and around
'Round and around, and around

Blueberry kisses
The muffin man, he misses them kisses, yeah
Where did they go now?
Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd L-O-V you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around
Yeah, I know it's crazy
But I've been feeling lately that I need you around-ou-ou-ou-ound

I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)
I need you around, 'round, 'round (blueberry kisses)

// Brooklyn Nights //

I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work (Make it work)
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu

// Captivated //

One look and I'm done
One glance from your eyes
And I'm captivated

The taste of your skin
The warmth of your hungry lips
Has me so taken and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you, I'm so sedated
I'm captivated by you

You're just like the wind 'cause
Everything moves away
When you're around it

The sun is just like the sound
Of your voice in the morning
When you light my world up and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
When I'm with you I'm never jaded
I'm captivated

Oh, I'll never stop believing
In this crazy love we're leading
Oh, sugar
Hold me closer
And make me sweeter
I need you
I love you

So, please, show me that smile
Make me laugh for just a little while
Then breathe me one breath
I only need one to fill the emptiness and I
Love the way you can make me dance
From miles away
It's been so long but now
I've waited, and I'm captivated

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

I need somebody who calls my name
When clouds are smoking up my way
You get me through these cha-changing skies
I don't wanna be afraid again
It's just that I could use a friend
You get me through these cha-changing skies

Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies

Oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

And I don't wanna be the kind to cry
I wanna dance right through the night
You get me through these cha-changing skies
Know that I am not emotional
It's just that I don't wanna fall without my parachute, tonight

Give me something that I can wrestle to the ground
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-iow
Believe me when I say that I will be okay
And listen, there's some voice and my cha-changing skies

Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Cha-cha-cha-changing
Changing skies
Changing skies
Changing skies

[Space Oddity:]

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

[Changes:]

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Ziggy Stardust:]

Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand, but made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Suffragette City:]

Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight

Oh, wham bam thank you ma'am!

Suffragette City

[Rebel Rebel:]

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

[Fashion:]

There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
Oooh, fashion!
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
Oooh, fashion!

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame

[Let's Dance:]

Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's sway to the song
They're playin' on the radio

If you say run, I'll run with you
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

[Heroes:]

I, I will be king
And you, you can be my queen
Anything could drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes, just for one day

// Dirty Ice Cream //

It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Don't be, don't be

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

High as a space cadet as I'm leapin' over stars
Enemy of the state, they got a target on your boy

'Cause I'm the hottest 'cross the board
Cruise through the ghetto, Mulsanne made of metal
Hangin' out the window, Bruce Willis on the pedal

What if I were to leave you
But then you fell back in love with me?

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

How could you ever let me go?
How could you ever, ever let me go?
I scream your name across the bar
I carry pictures of your Neil Young guitar, guitar

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my baby
You never made it through to you

If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

If I was the last girl
And you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake
Last girl, and you were the last boy left here on this planet
And there was an earthquake
Maybe then you'd love, baby, then you'd love me
If there was an earthquake

// Electric Kiss //

We are a generation twisted by a myth
Confused and ludicrous
Holding on to love
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst
A life without the lips we've kissed, and losing all control

We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

Fame is our felony
We're so in love with it
Some superstars and masochists who don't know where to go
But the poets and the fathers of our time
Put down their weapons in their arms, and know what they must do

We're gonna start a resistance
So we want independence
We're gonna give the world some of this

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness

Electric kiss
I'm gonna change the world with my lips
One voice forever
We'll live together in peace, love, solitude, and happiness
Electric kiss

// Fooled Me Again, Honest Eyes //

It's been a hard day
Harder night
The rock star's girlfriend
She lost the fight
Well, it's alright, baby, I'm nobody's mother
When you don't want the last cigarette to be over

You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

It's been two days since he left home
She dried her eyes
Picked up her microphone
She sang, "It's alright, baby."
I'm nobody's mother
But I don't want this last cigarette to be over

You fooled me again
Fooled me again with your honest, honest, honest eyes
Again, fooled me again with your dirty mouth full of honest lies
Again, oh, and you fool me again, oh yeah
You're so honest
Full of honest eyes

You fooled me again

// Fountain Of Truth //

[Melle Mel:]
All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all

Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands, (clap your hands)
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball y'all

[Lady Gaga:]
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that powerful fountain
That fountain of truth

No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of truth

[Melle Mel:]
The future is yours
The time is now
The place is here
Shout now
So every kid can hear
So every woman and man in the land can understand the new world
Inherited by the children
Free from famine or disease
That's right
Free from the gun and the knife
Forever, for life
Free from all the mistakes that we made in the past
Throw your hands in the air and let the truth last

[Lady Gaga:]
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that powerful fountain
That fountain of truth

No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of truth

[Melle Mel:]
You got the power
The wind in every hour
To blossom like a flower under the rain shower
The reach like the branch of the tree up in the sky
So reach high and soar with the eagles as we fly
Flight of great heights
Fight the great fights
Strong and sing songs of wrongs just made right
And the never ending search for the fountain of youth
In your youth you're bound to find a fountain of truth

[Lady Gaga:]
I've looked in the city
A place without pity
Seen mountains of wealth
Not fountains of health

Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of the truth

[Melle Mel:]
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball y'all
All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball y'all

Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball y'all

[Lady Gaga:]
Fountain of truth
Fountain of truth
Fountain of truth

// Frankensteined //

I woke up chained inside a vacant little room
Felt like a prisoner of his discretion
I couldn't breathe my lungs were captured by the fumes
My mind was in the arms of his possession

Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life, life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined

(Don't call me Gaga
I'm not that girl anymore)

Oh, I could think about the soul I used to be
But it's a waste because our time is precious
And as I traveled through the graveyards underneath
Felt like a queen but I'm a crooked princess

Turned off the lights but my aura was bright
Breathed in all the chemicals reborn again
I made my escape broke the windows of fate
No longer an animal take my hand and

Call me Mother Monster
I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor
He went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life, life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined

The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
I can taste the hunger
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Lightning and the thunder
The night is young but my spirit's even younger
Can you taste the hunger

Call me Mother Monster I will be your guide
Send me into the night, night, night
Blame it on the doctor he went and took a bite of my heart but it brought me to life, life, life
Sh-sh-shocked the system twisted every rhythm
Now I'm living the crime, crime, crime
Call me Mother Monster I am not a bride
Just the product of his design
I've been Frankensteined
I've been Frankensteined
I've been Frankensteined
Now I'm finally alive
I've been Frankensteined

I can't help myself
I'm in love
And when I get back from outer space
I'm gonna punch him in his face
He's one
He's a bad, bad boy
Got me twisted, uh
If he's the moon, then I'm eclipsed
I'm so lunar, yeah
When I get to him, run him over with my rocket ship

My eyeliner runs in constellations for you, dear
If only I could reboot my mechanical heart, I'd think clear

Baby, I'm feeling so out of this world
Baby, with you I'm a different girl
Oh-oh-oh, you're my future love
Baby, could we make a home in the stars?
Baby, somewhere in a galaxy far

Would you put me in your fu-future plans?
I want a fu-fu-fu-future man

I've been working and engineering, uh
All our chemistries and our situations
Working out our sex equations
And I know I'm no Nostradamus, yeah
When my hair is blond but my heart's brunette
If I'm not on him then at least I'm honest

My mascara runs in constellations for you dear, my dear
If only I could space my brain for a minute
I'd think clear

Fuel me up, and take me into a place we've never been
He is so unreal
He's a mannequin
A synthetic, plastic, rubber man
And I'm relying on, on a shooting star
To get to you my future love, ah-ah
He's my rubber hunk, my mechanic guy
And I'm stuck in his metal rubber eyes
Rubber eyes

Ain't life a many splendored thing?
Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

You're chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy

Run through an autumn shower
I'm better off with someone else like me

Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be

// Here We Go Again //

Red One, Pixie

All my friends are going out
But I've been thinking
Maybe I better stay in bed

The ceiling's spinning 'round
Like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head

Boom boom boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there

I sleep through the alarm
Head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this

I can't stand missing out
So when you call me, call me
I say okay if you insist

Boom boom boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there

Never wanna stay I wish I was there
Never wanna stay I wish I was there
Never wanna stay I wish I was there

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there

// Hold My Hand //

To tell me you need me

Hold my hand, everything will be okay
I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey
Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms
I see that you're hurtin', why'd you take so long

To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleeding
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise me, just hold my hand

Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes
That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time
I can see everything you're blind to now
Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how

To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleeding
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end

So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise you'll just hold my hand

Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand

I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect
But don't you give up on yourself
I've heard a story, a girl, she once told me
That I would be happy again

Hold my hand
Hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand
I heard from the heavens

// Hollywood //

Listen
I've got the sickest ambition
Deep in the mirror I am scared
Don't know who the hell is there
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection

Obsession
You'd think it's our new religion
Each model and celebrity
Changes how I look at me
Oh don't tell me, don't tell me I'll never be

A superstar 'cause I know I could look
Like a girl in Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood

Women
Let's talk about our condition
Now beauty's a commodity
Nip and tuck your fantasy
But you better live with your revision

I have a vision
It's a world without the incisions
Sure Hollywood's commercially
Glamorous but naturally's
The way to be and you can't tell me I'm not sexy

Like a superstar 'cause I know I could look
Like a girl in Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood

Woo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood

Oh, within a year I know I could
Oh, look like a girl in Hollywood
Oh, a superstar, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywoo-hood

Hollywood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood

Woo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, yeah

// I Wanna Be With You //

It's off, it's on
The party's just begun
Take off, and run
Let's celebrate the fun of being young
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna grow up

'Cause when the lights come on
You lift me up, and I feel strong

I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

Lights off, lights on
The music has begun
Rely, or run
Get the bad guy's gun
I love the songs that you play
And I don't care what they say
'Cause I was born this way

And I hear you scream, I hit the top of the stage
And close my eyes, and know exactly who I am
Oh-oh

And I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing while I'm living, but I wanna be in love
And I wanna be with you
This one's for you

I won't be right without you
And I might break without you
I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone
I'll write hit songs about you
No matter how, we'll get through
I'll keep on singing for a living, but I wanna be in love
And I, I wanna be with you
This one's for you

// I Want Your Love //

Nile, Chic, Gaga
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

Do you feel, like you ever want to try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Oh, all alone, in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you
And I dream of you, all of the time
What am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)

You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I need your love, you know I need your love

I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds needs sky above
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need

I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)

I want your love, I want your love
(Have you ever been in love?)
You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
I want your love, need your love
You know I need your love
I want your love, I want your love

// Imagine //

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy, if you try
No hell below us
And only Matthew in the sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Ah-ah-oh-oh-oh

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
Ah-ah-oh-oh-oh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
And the world will live as one

People of the nation
Are you listening?
It isn't equal if it's sometimes
I want a real democracy
Imagine all the people
Could love equally

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger, oh yeah
Just the brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people sharing in the world
With nothing to hate, and nothing to think
Just people to love, and friends to have drinks

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday that you'll join us
Oh-oh, yeah
And the world will live as one

// Ink //

I climb the mountain top, I saw the bottom drop
I cling to drift wood, I swim in the deep world

Words unspoken, seem so foreign
Have you heard this one?

The hair on the back of your neck stands
Another way out, another way out
The army ants have escaped
The hair on the back of your neck stands up
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany

Fang bite tarantula, taste of my symptoms
Gasoline and a pistol, blood filling the bathtub

Swollen eyelids, baffled by this
Tell us what you see?

The hair on the back of your neck stands
Another way out, another way out
The army ants have escaped
The hair on the back of your neck stands up
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany

I've bit my lip for the last time
Fog lifts up, for the blind
Free of body, free of mind
I'll build my mold up, rest inside

Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood

The hair on the back of your neck stands up
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany

The army ants have escaped

The hair on the back of your neck stands up
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany

Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood

Now the killer is said to be gone
Blood everywhere scare me scare me
Horror bubble horror scare
Inks everywhere

Ants eating brain
Bees eating your heart
Killer is me

// Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?) (Piano Version) //

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Call me Joanne
XO, Joanne
XOXO, Joanne
