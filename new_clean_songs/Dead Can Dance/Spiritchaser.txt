// Song Of The Stars //

We are the stars which sing
We sing with our light
We are the birds of fire
We fly over the sky

Our light is a voice
We make a road for the spirit to pass over
For the spirit to pass over

[Algonquian Indian]

We are like the wind
Wrapped in lumious wings
We make a road for the spirit to pass over
For the spirit of pass over

Outò, ba mwen son ou,e
Outò, ba mwen son ou,e
Tanbouyè, o ba mwen son ou
Solèy lève

Outò, give me your sound
Outò, give me your sound
Drummer, give me your sound
The sun rises

[Vodun Invocation - Haiti]

// Song Of The Dispossessed //

The river is deep and the road is long
Daylight comes and I want to go home

Awoke this morning
To find my people's tongues were tied
And in my dreams
They were given books to poison their minds

The river is deep and the mountain high
How long before the other side?

We are their mortar
Their building bricks and their clay
Their gold teeth mirror
Both our joys and our pain

The river is deep and the ocean wide
Who will show us how to read the signs?

The earth is our mother
She taught us to embrace the light
Now the lord is master
She suffers an eternal night

You blocked up my ears
You plucked out my eyes
You cut out my tongue
You fed me with lies

Oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord
