// The Trial //

All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze
It took a lifetime to get here
A journey I'll never make again

For those who have accepted the burden of shame
For the innocent only guilt will remain
And our lives will be forced to accommodate
The perpetrators of our own bastard race

All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze
It took a lifetime to get here
A journey I'll never make again

I stand accused of a thousand and one crimes
A witness to events that led to this present time
These traditions which bind our hands and keep us tied
Will never survive the greatest test of time

Deliver me from all these feverish eyes
That threaten to unbalance my state of mind
For I must confess only to the smallest of crimes

A sense of guilt
A sense of guilt
A sense of guilt
A sense of guilt

// Frontier //

Please, go after him,
'Cause he delayed them there.
I see the proud man.

He delayed to see them all.
All have stayed,
The bloodstains on the floor.

He left, he's left.
He's gone today,
He's gone back,
He's gone back.
I just want to make him understand,
Teach another lesson,
Make them go and see the proud man.

// Fortune //

From ancient times to the present day
There have been those who have claimed her as a lover
So driven by the will to possess
Have pursued her to the very ends of the earth

We enter into it, it enters into us
We enter into it, it enters into us
As the wheel spins and turns
The fortunate ones are seen to emerge
We enter into it, it enters into us

Fortune smiles upon our heads
Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
I'm lost in the security of our new found wealth

There are those of you amongst us
Bearing vacant faces and empty smiles
Their fates have already been decided upon
They will leave behind them only the victims of their misplaced trust

We enter into it, it enters into us
We enter into it, it enters into us
As the wheel spins and turns
The fortunate ones are seen to emerge
We enter into it, it enters into us

Fortune smiles upon our heads
Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
I'm lost in the security of our new found wealth

Fortune smiles upon our heads
Fortune smiles upon our heads

// East Of Eden //

I was told this in a distant land
Where tortured souls have to fight together in anguish
And the scenes of the show
Are of a cruel and violent nature

Scenes of pain and cruelty
Are there to be seen
The arena, the town, the place was set
For all to watch and see

I was told this in a distant land
Where the oppressor ruled with an iron hand
And the mission of saddened complacency
Left cold and emotionless by history

Scenes of pain and cruelty
Are there to be seen
All the while I should have known
It was you killing me

Somewhere east of Eden
The designs will never change
Vented through others' fear
The world stops at the end of the hall

We watch the life force fade away
And that's the price we shall have to pay

Once you are dead
How could the children have known

// Threshold //

Come in here
Where it's nice
If you want
If you want
If you want

// A Passage In Time //

These silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all
Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call

Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the fires burn

These silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all
Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call

Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl

Well, opportunity's doors did not open wide
The answers remain locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside

So forced into labour we till the earth
To sow the seeds of our own rebirth
As the days turned into years
Our faith overcame any doubts or fears
Any doubts or fears
Are there any doubts or fears?
any doubts or fears
Are there any doubts or fears?

In truth we had found the key
But its application would unravel this mystery
This mystery
This mystery
This mystery
This mystery

// Wild In The Woods //

Wild in the woods of love
We harm those whom we adore
And contrary to all good intentions
We suffocate them in an alarming embrace

Listen, child, try to understand
All is not what it appears to be in the world at hand
Here dreams are bought and sold for a price
The truth a burden to keep for the rest of your life

These paths that we have chosen
Can only lead to fear and despair
So we learn from and experience the corporeal
All is hidden in hidden meanings
All can be learned from within
We're all brothers and sisters in spirit

Wild in the woods of love
We harm those whom we adore
And contrary to all good intentions
We suffocate them in an alarming embrace

// In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated //

Sail on silver wings
Through this storm what fortune love may bring
Back to my arms again
The love of a former golden age

I am disabled by fears
Concerning which course to take
For now that wheels are turning
I find my faith deserting me

This night is filled with the cries
Of dispossessed children in search of paradise
A sign of unresolved ambition
Drives the pinwheel on and on

I am disabled by fears
Concerning which course to take
When memory bears witness to
The innocents consumed in dying rage

The way lies through our love
There can be no other means to the end
Or keys to my heart you will never find
You will never find

// The Arcane //

Here in the garden of the arcane delights
Dark shadows overwhelm us and we become blind
Blind to the needs of those who would be free
From the grip of fear and the prisons of the mind

Amidst the throes of perplexity
Phobia moves amongst us, in her hand is held the seed
Extermination angel stood beside the road
In violent retribution for the seeds that we have sown
