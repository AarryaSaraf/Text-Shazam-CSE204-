// Barnaby, Hardly Working //

For the moment slipped right through him
Combed his hair, combed his hair
Knew the feeling of contentment
An actors' actor
An actors' actor.

She smiled a smile uncomprehending
As he took his time, took his time.
Wore a hat, so he'd impress her.
Took a ride,
Took a ride.

Says, "I could wait for hours.
I could wait and never fall down,
Never fall down,
Never fall down."

Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river

// Speeding Motorcycle //

Speeding motorcycle
Wont you change me
In a world of funny changes
Speeding motorcycle
Wont you change me

Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Always changing me
Speeding motorcycle
Don't you drive recklessly
Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart

Many girls have taken you out for a ride, 
hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down

Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Lets be smart
Because we don't want a wreck
We can do alot of tricks
We don't have to break our legs
To get our kicks
Speeding motorcycle
The road is ours
Speeding motorcycle
Lets speed some more

Because we don't need reason and we don't need logic 
because we got feelin' and were damn proud of it

Speeding motorcycle
There's nothing you can do
Speeding motorcycle
I love you
Speeding motorcycle
Lets just go
Speeding motorcycle
Lets go, lets go, lets go

// Some Kinda Fatigue //

Sitting in a parked car 
Trying hard to smile 
But I've been looking for one good reason 
But I haven't found it yet 
Took awhile, well, what's it gonna be? 
The way it's got to be 
I know it's out there 
One good reason 
But I haven't found it yet 
I'm stepping away, stepping away from you 
Some weird kinda fatigue 
Someday I'll find it, 
One good reason 
But I haven't found it yet

// Evanescent Psychic Pez Drop //

Two times two, left to right
Big red laugh on a worried face
So drawn out, can't be erased
While your eyes fade to the white

Two times two, left to right
Big red laugh on a worried face
So drawn out, can't be erased
While your eyes fade to the white

// Demons //

When she sleeps she shuts out the eyesights of you 
When you call her name she trembles at what you might do

Daytime - save her and she might give in
Nighttime - demons who know you can't win

Sleeping demons
They lurk but they don't make a sound
But you won't get up even when they're not around

Daytime - brings out the promise within
Nighttime - demons who know you can't win

Daytime - brings out the promise within
Nighttime - demons who know you can't win
Daytime - brings out the promise within
Demons who know you can't win

// Fog Over Frisco //

It's gonna be a bumpy night she said
Or something or other I didn't know
It's a messed-up situation
It's a stab in the back when you turn to gold
When you turn to gold

Yeah yeah, do you think it'll work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
I could think about it

What am I supposed to do now?
I had a chance in a million, it slipped away
There's a change in the weather coming
When what once was black and white will slowly turn to gray

Yeah yeah, do you think it'll work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
I could think about it

Yeah yeah, said do you think it could work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
Harm that comes from change

// Too Late //

Oh, you should miss her, she says she's my sister
She's never hard to find
She's tender-trusting, she's everlasting
Can I change my mind?

Is it too late to change my mind?

Mirror, mirror, icy sister
Love is never blind
She's slowly turning, mouth gently burning
Can I change my mind?

Is it too late to change my mind?

She pisses icy water on poetic mornings
Got to be cruel to be kind
Is this real life, is it for life?
Can I change my mind?

Is it too late to change my mind?

Is it too late to change my mind?
Is it too late?

// Hanky Panky Nohow //

If the satcheting of gentlemen
Gives you grievance now and then
What's needed are some memories of planing lakes
those planing lakes will surely calm you down.

Nothing frightens me more
Than religion at my door
I never answer panick knocking
Falling down the stairs upon the law,
What law?

There's a law for everything
And for Elephants that sing to keep
The cows that agriculture won't allow
Hanky Panky nohow
Hanky Panky nohow
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh

There's a law for everything
And for Elephants that sing to keep
The cows that agriculture won't allow
Hanky Panky nohow
Hanky Panky nohow
Hanky Panky nohow ohhhhhhh

// Something To Do //

I took a ride by a police station
It seemed like something to do
I heard a voice saying, "What are you trying to prove?"

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I couldn't decide

Next thing I knew I was out and bound and
On my own again
I looked around to see what I could find

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I couldn't decide

There's a time when your life is full of meaning
That's the time that I'm looking forward to

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I never decide

// Ultra-Powerful Short Wave Radio Picks Up Music From Venus //

He loved to listen to sports from Spain
Newscasts from Nebraska
Mariachi music from Mexico
And weather reports from Alaska

He heard talk shows in Texas and Tennessee
And a ballgame in Baltimore
But one night he listened to something strange
That he'd never heard before

He turned the volume all the way up
Until it hissed and it crackled and popped
A few minutes later he turned it off
And his ears rang after it stopped

He scratched his head and rubbed his eyes
Then a grin spread across his face
Somehow he figured that what he had heard
Was coming from outer space

The song was sincere and simple
But it lacked any wit or charm
It sounded a lot like a cross between
A drill and a burglar alarm

It might have been music from Venus
That he listened to that night
But I think it was probably the static you hear
When your radio's not tuned in right

// Up To You //

Hold a mirror on your own true heart
You'll leave it to me or I won't let go
It's up to you

It wears me out
It's up to you

Take the beeline to your safety net
And don't wait for me
I'll only slow you down
It's up to you

It wears me out
It's up to you
It wears me out
It's up to you

When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone

// Somebody's Baby //

Well, just look at that girl
With the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby

All the guys on the corner stand back
And let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so fine

She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right

I heard her talkin' with her friend
When she thought nobody else was around
She said she's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby

'Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights
Light up the town
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so

She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

I try to shut my eyes
But I can't get her outta my sight
I know I'm gonna know her
But I gotta get over my fright
Well, I'm just gonna walk up to her
I'm gonna talk to her tonight

Ah

Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Ah
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight

// Walking Away From You //

[?] skates by in the dead of night
Whispering ideas that catch and hold on tight
My eyes they wander, taking a cue
I look down and wonder if I'm walking away from you

Rain soaked cops don't crash on a curvy street
[?]
My eyes they wander, taking a cue
I look down and wonder if I'm walking away from you

// Artificial Heart //

Artificial heart pumps blood into
A tired body during operation
Heart connected to the arteries
[?]

// Cast A Shadow //

The sandman is bringing me a special gift
A sleepy dream memory of our first kiss

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

The sandman comes tonight, I have a request
A snapshot dreamy keepsake of your embrace

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

Cast your shadow over here, we'll make shadow plays
We'll dig shallow graves in my shady shadow cave
Your shadow grows longer in my twilight sleep
I wallow in remember your lock me keep

Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction
Cast your shadow in my direction

Bring back shadows of your affection
Cast your shadow in my direction
Bring back shadows of your protection
Cast your shadow in my direction

// I'm Set Free //

I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been blinded but
Now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walk right by me

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people
What I found
I saw my head laughing
Rolling on the ground

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
