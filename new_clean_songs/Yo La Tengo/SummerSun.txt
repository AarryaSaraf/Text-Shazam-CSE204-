// Little Eyes //

Took a walk alone last night, slept inside your head
It was raining hard again, crawled back into bed
Tried to catch up to you but you moved too fast
Thought about a million things, fell asleep at last

Got up again last night, tore all over town
Skidding tires, screeching brakes barely make a sound
We were on a winding road going 65
Slid along an icy stretch, made it back alive

Little eyes are open but they don't see very far
You can only hurt the ones you love, not the ones you're thinking of
Little eyes are open but they're sinking back again
Don't you know you're sleeping much too long, wake up little eyes

Moving but not gaining any ground
Climbing up the escalator as it takes you down

Last night I heard this sound echoed everywhere
Like a buzzing amplifier burning through the air
It's still raining hard, you said, have you any clue?
Is it ever gonna stop? I guess that's up to you

Little eyes are open but they don't see very far
You can only hurt the ones you love, not the ones you're thinking of
Little eyes are open but they're sinking back again
Don't you know you're sleeping much too long, wake up little eyes

// Nothing But You And Me //

Well, I don't care what's wrong or right when you're not there by my side
I just wonder what to do, well, if I can't have you
And I think about nothing much at all, nothing but you and me
And I'm pleading, can't we just be the way that we used to be?

Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me?
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be
If we make up, well, I won't ever be that bad
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance

Well, I don't know how I lost control but I now know that it's true
That the hurt I aimed at me misfired and came back to hurt you
I've been wondering where you are tonight and wondering where you've been
Now I'll walk these lonely streets awhile and think about it again

Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me?
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be
If we make up, well I won't ever be that bad
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance

What can I do?
What can I say?

Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me?
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be
If we make up, well I won't ever be that bad
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance

I won't ever be that bad
Won't you please come back to me?
What can I do?
What can I say?

// Season Of The Shark //

Do you need someone to hide behind?
Well, I don't mind, well, I don't mind
Do you need to be alone to unwind?
Well, that's alright, that's alright

Sure I know it's hard
You know that it's that way for everyone, for everyone
Some things go wrong
Sink so low you even blame the sun

You blame it as the cause
Of the shadows on the wall
They're not as bad as they appear
Could it be that it's the season of the shark?

Do you need someone to help you through?
Well, I don't know, I don't know
Someone to take questions for you
I don't know, I don't know

I want to be
The one to make you feel okay right now, someway, somehow
When I fall short
I sink so low I even blame the clouds

For blocking out the sun
And the shadows on the wall
That's why you feel alone
Could it be that it's the season of the shark?

Please don't be afraid
No matter how much out there scares you so, scares you so
Just look around
If it's not me then someone else you know

You're not alone at all
Ignore the shadows on the wall
They don't mean a thing
Could it be that it's the season, I believe that it's the season of the shark

Could it be that it's the season of the shark?

// Today Is The Day //

I followed you...foolishly
You were at a smoky bar, you were out til three
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four
Couldn't wait for you all night
So I locked the door

I was gonna spend the night, coulda been okay
We were gonna talk all night, till I went away
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late
A minute later we're older now, I can't stay awake
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday

Saw my brother driving by, the other day
I wished that i'd go out to him, but he drove away
Saw my sister standing there, standing in rain
Then I thought about nothing, that it feels the same

Another day, come and gone
Don't think I can ever sing that song
Little secrets we bring along
I'm taking my time, trailing behind, I thought of you
Today is the day I think of you

// Tiny Birds //

I will go if you say you'll go, do you want to go?
I won't talk at all, but I'll go for a ride
I will go if you just let go, do you want to go?
Is it all because of the time I took your advice?

I will go if you still want to go, do you want to go?
And I will show what you want me to show, do you want to know?
Until there's nothing left in the world to show you

On we go, but where I don't know, do you want to go?
You don't talk at all but it's alright
Feeling bold but your nose is cold like it's made of snow
Is it all because of the time you took my advice?

If you put your hand in my palm, I won't let it go
Until there's nothing left in the world to make me

Summer stinks and summer stays too long
Autumn comes and all of a sudden it's gone
Tiny birds sit patiently
Side by side on a wire

Darker days and leaves in shades so true
Wind unfolds on nights so black they're blue
Tiny birds fly by silently
Side by side in the sky

Don't be sad when it's time to say goodnight
I'll be there to make sure that you sleep tight
I'm your friend when you need a friend
Until there's nothing left in the world to make you cry

// How To Make A Baby Elephant Float //

I like to hold hands when we walk
I'm not averse to pillow talk
But I prefer a private joke, the memory it evokes
Because it's our punchline, it's our punchline

That film we saw from the front row
It means so much to us alone
I love the wrinkled brow of anyone else around
Because it's our punchline, it's our punchline

And when we're out
Then you say "it would appear"
We laugh and laugh
No one else hears, no one at all

And when we're out
Then you say "it would appear"
We laugh and laugh
No one else hears, no one at all

If you want to be a romantic fool
You don't have to say I love you
Just say what's in your heart, non-sequitir or not
And without even trying, find your punchline, find your punchline

// Don't Have To Be So Sad //

You and me were at some goldfish pond
And I, I was tagging along for the ride
All the big-mouthed fish really made us laugh

And while I stood still, I felt a chill
I thought that maybe you did too
I wanted to feel that way forever

And that's why if you're looking at me, I'll try
To be what you want to see, and if I'm
If I'm ever that lucky
You won't have to be so, you won't have to be so sad

You won't have to be so sad

Last night I was trying to read in bed
I got to watching you sleep instead
Even when I got tired, I couldn't stop

Because I love you so
And I pray you know
But I'm not much for praying
I knew I couldn't say that without making a joke

And that's why if you're looking at me, I'll try
To be what you want to see, and if I'm
If I'm ever that lucky
You won't have to be so, you won't have to be so sad

You won't have to be so sad

Yeah, that's why if you're looking at me, I'll try
To be what you want to see, and if I'm
If I'm ever that lucky
You won't have to be so, you won't have to be so sad

You won't have to be so sad
You won't have to be so sad

// Winter A Go-Go //

On the beach overseas
Icy water slaps at our knees
And the buoy was signaling
As if it knew we were far from home

Then you looked at me
And all I could see
Were the lights that were flickering
And suddenly we were all alone

It's not an impossible thing to do
Yet I'm helpless to do anything for you
I can't keep from wondering

You were under a spell
Waiting for time to tell
If I could, you know I would
Accept this moment and sympathize

Then you looked at me
And then all I could see
Were the walls closing again
And the desperation in your eyes

It's not an impossible thing to do
I know there's a better life for you
I can't keep from wondering

It's not an impossible thing to do
And I'm helpless to say anything to you
I want to see a better life for you
But I can't keep from wondering

// Moonrock Mambo //

Like a thumb in a rubber glove
Or a moon rock in the sky above
I'm thinking, could it be
That I'm falling in love?

Like a Chunky or a Charleston Chew
Like shoe crab soup or chicken stew
Like Cinderella's other shoe
I just want to be next to you

I want to be
I want to be next to you
I want to be
I want to be next to you

Like a palindrome or a friend indeed
Like wow, or Tara Key
It seems I always need reminding
What a fool believes

Like Horton hearing a Who
Like everything old becoming new
Like looking out for number two
I just want to be next to you

I want to be
I want to be next to you
Yeah, I want to be
I want to be next to you

Like Dr. Tom, like Mr. Met
Like Professor Frink, like a Chia pet
Like Eddie Bow, like Bob Levito
Like Jill Talley, like Don Cheadle

I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you

Like eating ribs with Calvin Trillin
Like Timothy Carey in The Killing
Like Steve Coogan and Rebecca Front
Like Jefferson Airplane except no Grunt

I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you
I want to be next to you

// Let's Be Still //

Let's be still, be still for awhile
There's no place I want to be
Lose our way and sit side by side
Passing time so carelessly, so carelessly

Along the shore, a quiet night
Take off our shoes and watch the sky
Against the moon the clouds go by
I hold your hand, you start to cry

Lost in our dreams of summer love
The only place I want to be
Find a spot and hope no one tells
Time goes by unendingly, unendingly

// Take Care //

Take care not to hurt yourself
Beware of the need for help
You might need too much
When people are such

Take care, please
Take care

Some people read idea books
And some people have pretty looks
But if your eyes are wide
And all words aside

Take care, please
Take care

This sounds a bit like goodbye
In a way it is, I guess
As I leave your side
I've taken the air

Take care, please
Take care
Take care, please
Take care
