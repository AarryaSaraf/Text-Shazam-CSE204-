// Can't Take My Eyes Off You //

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Then let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
I love you baby, don't let me down I pray
I love you baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
I love you baby, don't let me down I pray
I love you baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say

// First Be A Woman //

You can go to Harvard
You can be a pilot
You can be an astronaut
But first, be a woman, ooh ooh...
When you're walking down the street
Show your feminine appeal
Even tho' you're wearing jeans
It's important to be real
You were born to be yourself
So no matter how you feel
If you want to impress the opposite sex
When he takes you for a ride
Let him open you the door
When he asks you for a dance
Let him lead you to the floor
When he kisses you good night
You just leave him wanting more
You can do all you can
Say I am what I am
But first be a woman... oh oh oh oh
When he takes you out to dine
Don't you end up in his bed
Wedding bells will ring in time
Make him dream of you instead
And his passion can be like
All the stories that you've read
He can be Romeo if you act like Juliet
Nowadays it ends too soon
Even tho' it's just begun
You can take him to the moon
He'll leave with the morning sun
So take a lesson from the past
Make him want and make him run...
(You can't be a quarterback
He can't wear a pretty dress
You cannot be Superman
And he's not a shy princess
So why try to be alike
When it's only self defense?
You've got grace, he's got style
And together you'll rhyme
So remember to be true 
To the legend that you are
All the feminine in you 
Has worked miracles so far
So head up high and don't be shy
You can reach for any star 
You can do all you can...
Say I am what I am
You can be an executive
Hhh! You can drive a train
You can be a detective...

// I'll Be There //

Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all your hope is gone
And your life is filled with confusion
And happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumblin' down
Darling, reach out
Reach out, for me.

I'll be there to love and comfort you...(tell me baby)
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through

Now when you're lost and about to give up
'cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're driftin' on your own
When you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out
Reach out, for me.

I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through

I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there to with the love I'll see you through

I can tell you the way I hang your head
Now with out of love , now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found

I know what you're thinking
Without love, now you're alone
Baby, reach out
Reach out for me

I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through

I'll be there to love and comfort you
Tell me baby
I'll be there to always see you through
I'll be there

I'll be there to love and comfort you
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through.

// Last Night //

I've been spending too much time
Living in your world instead of mine
Telling myself that's where I'd rather be
Pouring the coffee and pouring the wine
Waiting for you to have forever in mind
So much more than childish fantasies

It's the last night
It's our last kiss
For tomorrow I'll be gone
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms
It's the last night 
Come the sunrise
You can catch me moving on
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs

See I've got dreams, I've been dreaming too
Maybe this time I will see them through
With a man who wants a love for keeps
I put on my lipstick and pack me a bag
Check my look in the mirror and call me a cab
Gonna drive 'til your pull is out of reach

Oh, it's the last night
It's our last kiss
For tomorrow I'll be gone
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms
It's the last night 
Come the sunrise
You can catch me moving on
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs

I wish you the very best, you know I really do
You'll find someone who has temporary dreams like you
Baby, mine, mine go on forever
I can feel the future and the wind inside my hair
Something's trying to tell me there's a whole new world out there
Baby, I'm sure it just gets better

Oh, it's the last night
It's our last kiss
For tomorrow I'll be gone
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms
It's the last night 
Come the sunrise
You can catch me moving on
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs

// Love Is Just A Heartbeat Away //

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm craving all the things I can say

I'm in love with you
You're inside my soul
And when I'm with you
I just lose control
Whatever I am
Wherever I go
Stay with me

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm waiting for a man who will stay

I'm in love with you
Now turn on my dream
Please, be real
Let's keep love our theme
You're what I want
You're what I need
I love you

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today

Now my love is here
No more nights alone
'Cause I know you're real
From the love you've shown
Faithful and true
My special affair
I'm in love with you

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm waiting for a man who will stay
