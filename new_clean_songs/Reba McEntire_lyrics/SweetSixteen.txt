// Cathy's Clown //

I want your loving more and more

I want your kisses that's for sure

I die each time

I hear the sound

They're saying here he comes

He's Cathy's Clown


You know you've got to stand tall

You know a man can't crawl

And when you let her tell you lies

And you let em pass you by

You're not a man at all


She don't want your loving anymore

She don't want your kisses that's for sure

Why do you let them put you down

And let em call you Cathy's Clown


When you see me shed a tear

Then you know that I'm sincere

I just think it's kinda sad

That she's treating you so bad

And I'm the one who cares


I want your loving more and more

I want your kisses that's for sure

I die each time

I hear the sound

They're saying here he comes

He's Cathy's Clown


You're Cathy's Clown

You're Cathy's Clown

// 'Til Love Comes Again //

White light shadows gather around my door

They find me dreaming all alone once more

Memories come around to haunt my sleepless sounds

Now's the time I must be strong

I believe it won't be long


Till love comes again

To end these lonely nights

Till love comes again

To drive these tears I cry

It's darkest just before the dawn

And I'll just keep holding on

Till then

Till love comes again


Somewhere someone feels the way I do

And like me they dream of the love that's true

One day I'll look into his eyes I know the moment's right

Until then I'll just wait

No matter how long it might take


Till love comes again

To end these lonely nights

Till love comes again

To drive these tears I cry

It's darkest just before the dawn

And I'll just keep holding on

Till then

Till love comes again


Oh until then

Till love comes again

// It Always Rains On Saturday //

On Monday the sun will be shining

On Tuesday the weather was fine

Wednesday and Thursday went by

By Friday the clouds filled the sky


Dismorning I knew it would rain

The moment the telephone rang

I heard your voice and I knew

The sky turned a new shade of blue


And it looks like rain

It always rains on Saturday

The dark clouds came

And the sunny days are gone away

This house feels so cold

It always feels like this when he goes away

There's really nothing new about the rain

It always rains on Saturday


I look into Billy's young smile

And watch him watch Big Bird a while

His daddy will be here by eight

Seems like the sky's turning grey

There's an overnight bag on the stairs

Beside a one eyed teddy bear

I hold Billy and try not to cry

And whisper kiss mommy goodbye


And it looks like rain

It always rains on Saturday

The dark clouds came

And the sunny days are gone away

This house feels so cold

It always feels like this when he goes away

There's really nothing new about the rain

It always rains on Saturday

It always feels like this when Billy goes away

// Am I The Only One Who Cares //

Jamie turned 13 tonight

But she didn't blow out the birthday lights

Jamie and her momma had another big fight

She locked herself in her room


She climbed up on her windowsill

Sat and stared at the cars on the street

And listened to her own heart beat

And whispered to the moon


Am I the only one who cares what I do

Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to

Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you

Or am I the only one who cares what I do


The moon said Jamie can't you hear yourself

You're acting like there ain't nobody else

Come on girl take a big ole breath

You know what you gotta do


There's one more thing before I go

A woman's been standing at the window below

Searching for the words to let you know

How much she loves you too


And you're not the only one who cares what you do

And I'm not the only one that you can turn to

Now Jamie please believe me

It's not just me and you

And I'm not the only one who cares

She cares too


Jamie heard her mama

Softly knocking at her door

The moon just smiled and whispered

You all don't need me anymore


I'm not the only one who cares what you do

And I'm not the only one you can tell your troubles to

I've done the best I can

Now the rest is up to you

And I'm not the only one who cares

You both care too

You both care too

// Somebody Up There Likes Me //

I can't get used to the hustle

I try to keep my actions straight

I get caught in the bustle

I do things I really hate


Just when I think I'm sinking

I hear a voice inside my head

Says don't do what you're thinking

Send your thoughts to me instead


Somebody up there likes me

Somebody up there knows what I need

When my worldly head spins around

He sends his love down


You know I'm only human

That's all I always say

It's just excuses

So I can do things my own way

But when I fall and stumble

I know I will be saved

No my world won't crumble

I'll make it through the hardest days


Somebody up there likes me

Somebody up there knows what I need

When my worldly head spins around

He sends his love down


I wish I'd known all along

But it's much better late

Than to never know you're wrong


Somebody up there likes me

Somebody up there knows what I need

When my worldly head spins around

He sends his love down


Somebody up there likes me

Somebody up there knows what I need

When my worldly head spins around

He sends his love down


He sends his love down

Somebody up there likes me

// You Must Really Love Me //

Tell me why do you put up with my foolish ways

You never take to heart the crazy things I say

Oh I know you could walk out on me any day

There must be a darn good reason why you'd even want to stay


You must really love me

How can it be true

There are things you'll take from me

I won't even take from you

Everytime I fall apart

You always pull me through

You must really love me

As much as I love you

You must really love me

As much as I love you


I appreciate the honesty you've shown to me

And the way you tell your friends that you belong to me

And when you hold me tight it always sets me free

Oh this must be the way that true love was meant to be


You must really love me

How can it be true

There are things you'll take from me

I won't even take from you

Everytime I fall apart

You always pull me through

You must really love me

As much as I love you

You must really love me

As much as I love you

And Lord I'm glad you do

// Say The Word //

Ooo say the word

And I'll be yours

Say the word

So I'll be sure

That what I'm feeling goes for both of us

I hate to hear you tell me what you feel is really love


Say the word

Open up

Say the word

What's the hold up

Before I go and give my heart away

I need to know I'm falling for a man who ain't afraid to


Say the word

It's just four little letters

And if you really mean it

you've got me forever

And I've got so much love for you

That all you gotta do

Is say the word


And I'll be there

Anytime, anywhere


Say the word

It's just four little letters

And if you really mean it

you've got me forever

And I've got so much love for you

That all you gotta do

Is say the word


And I'll be yours

So I'll be sure

Say the word

And I'll be there

Anytime, anywhere

// Little Girl //

Daddy used to tell me

If I ran too fast I'd fall and hurt myself

But the ice cream man would ring his bell

And I'd get there before anyone else


I'd see a puppy in the window

And I'd run and press my face against the pane

And Daddy'd say slow down girl

After all these years I guess nothing has changed


That little girl I knew

Ran after you

But she fell this time

And broke her heart in two

Hey that's just like a little girl I knew


Back home there stands an old house

With a picket fence beneath a big oak tree

I can almost see the backyard

And a little girl with freckles

That was me


And there were dreams of toys and storybooks and

Lord it seemed I wanted them so bad

Now 20 years have come and gone

And I'm still chasing things that I can't have


That little girl I knew

Ran after you

But she fell this time

And broke her heart in two

Hey that's just like a little girl I knew


Yes, I'm still that little girl


Daddy I still haven't slowed down yet

// Walk On //

Oh ain't life wonderful

When everything is right

But sometimes wonderful

Can fall apart sometimes

When your troubles knock you down

Pick yourself up off the ground and


Walk on

Walk on

Nothing ever stays wrong that long

Walk on

Oh walk on

Don't just stand there in the storm

Walk toward the light till you find the sun

And you'll be better off in the long run

And walk on


Oh it's a heartache when love comes to an end

But even though your heart breaks

You know it's gonna mend

Keep the faith right through goodbye

And don't you ever break your stride


Walk on

Walk on

Nothing ever stays wrong that long

Walk on

Oh walk on

Don't just stand there in the storm

Walk toward the light till you find the sun

And you'll be better off in the long run

And walk on


Walk on

Walk on

Nothing ever stays wrong that long

Walk on

Oh walk on

Don't just stand there in the storm

Walk toward the light till you find the sun

And you'll be better off in the long run

And walk on


Walk on

Walk on

Ohhh walk on

Walk on

Oh walk on

// A New Love //

Love's the only thing I know in this life

That's cut me deeper than the sharpest knife

And once again, here I am

And I'd pay any price for a new love


I still hurt for the one I lost

I'm standin' here on a bridge that I can't get across

And I can't burn, but I will

When I walk with a new love


(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)

It's gonna be better than ever before

That's why I'm lookin' for

A new love for this ol' heart

A new love and I just can't wait to start

(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again

(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love

For this ol' heart of mine


Said I'm lookin' for a new love

Somebody tell me where I'll find a new love

For this ol' heart of mine


Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry

But nothin's ever made me feel more alive

And that's why, once again, here I am

Lookin' for the eyes of a new love


I know that somewhere in this world tonight

There's a guy, and I'd take a bus, car, a train or a flight

I'd even walk if I thought I might find a new love


(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)

It's gonna be better than ever before

That's why I'm lookin' for

A new love for this ol' heart

A new love and I just can't wait to start

(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again

(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love

For this ol' heart of mine


Said I need a new love

For this ol' heart of mine


(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)

It's gonna be better than ever before

That's why I'm lookin' for

A new love for this ol' heart

A new love and I just can't wait to start

(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again

(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love

For this ol' heart of mine


Oh, I'm lookin' for a new love

For this ol' heart of mine

Said, I need a new love

For this ol' heart of mine

Oh, I'm lookin' for a new love

Somebody tell me where I'll find (a new love)

For this ol' heart of mine
