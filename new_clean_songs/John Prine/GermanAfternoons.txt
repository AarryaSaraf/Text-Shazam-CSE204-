// Paradise //

When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.

[Chorus:]
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.

[Chorus]

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.

[Chorus]

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am.

[Chorus]

// Lulu Walls //

One evening getting dark
We first met at the park
Just sitting by the fountain all alone
I lifted up my hat
And then began to chat
She said she'd allow me to see her at her home

[Chorus:]
Such a star I've never seen
She's as pretty as the queen
She's as perfect as an angel from above
If she'd only be my wife
I'd live happy all me life
With that aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.

If she were only mine
I'd build a house so fine
And around it so many fences tall
It would make me jealously
To think that none but me
Could gaze upon that beauty Lulu Walls.

[Chorus]

One evening getting late
Well, I met her at the gate
I asked her if she'd wed me in the fall
But she only turned away
And nothing would she say
That aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.

[Chorus]

With that aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.

// Speed Of The Sound Of Loneliness //

You come home late and you come home early
You come on big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home curly
Sometimes you don't come home at all

[Chorus:]
So what in the world's come over you
And what in heaven's name have you done
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind

[Chorus]

It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow
We ain't got one word to say

[Chorus]

[Ending:]
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run

// Out Of Love //

Barley malts and does eat oats and little girls are lively
And your liveliness has left me in a brew
So I'm sitting here just drinking beer
Cause there's nothing else to do.
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

We were so happy, honey when we were together
Why we should have won a ribbon colored blue
But those Rocky Mountain waters came between us
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

[Chorus:]
So I'm living in the land of sky blue waters
And I'm grabbing all the gusto up it's true
Well, you only go around once in life they say
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you

These teardrops that I'm crying are the champagne of bottled tears,
And I must admit that I've shed one or two,
But when good friends get together well they always tip a few
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

[Chorus]

So put me in a cool place for I'm the King of Beers
Forty to forty-five degrees will do
And if you must play that jukebox let it be low and now
'Cause when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.

[Chorus]

[Ending:]
So if you go the time, we got the tears
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you

// Sailin' Around //

Sailin' around, Sailin' around, Sailin' around,
I've been out sailin' around again
I've been sailin' around
But I can't get back to you.

Hangin' around, Hangin' around, Hangin' around
I've been out hangin' around again
I've been hangin' around
But I can't get back to you.

[Chorus:]
So tell where you been so long (sailin' around)
What have I done so wrong? (sailin' around)
Well, I'm so glad I finally found you
I can't wait to put my arms around you
Sailin' around, but I can't get back to you

Shoppin' around, Shoppin' around, Shoppin' around,
I've been shoppin' around again
I've been shoppin' around
But I can't get back to you.

[Chorus]

Sailin' around, Sailin' around, Sailin' around,
I've been sailin' around again
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.

// If She Were You //

Well, every time I try to love another
I never know exactly what to do
I'd like to tell her just how much I want her
And I could find the way if she were you

Her eyes may shine for me and not another,
Her lonely arms reach out to hold me too,
She wants to take your place and be my lover
And I could make her mine if she were you

I never knew how much I cared about you
Till your memory made me a lovesick fool

When she speaks to me I hear you sweet voice calling
When I close my eyes your face comes into view
I remember how it hurt when I was falling
And I could fall again if she were you

I never knew how much I cared about you
Till your memory made me a lovesick fool
She wants to take your place and be my lover
And I could make her mine if she were you
Yes, I could make her mine if she was you

// Linda Goes To Mars //

I just found out yesterday that Linda goes to Mars
Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars
She'll turn on her radio and sit down in her chair
And look at me across the room, as if I wasn't there

[Chorus:]
Oh My stars! My Linda's gone to Mars
Well I wish she wouldn't leave me here alone
Oh My stars! My Linda's gone to Mars
Well, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.

Something, somewhere, somehow took my Linda by the hand
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band
For when the moon shines down up on our happy, humble home
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown.

[Chorus]

Now I ain't seen no saucers 'cept the ones upon the shelf
And if I ever seen one I'd keep it to myself
For if there's life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth
Then Linda must have gone out there and got her money's worth.

[Chorus]

Yeah, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.

// Let's Talk Dirty In Hawaiian //

Well, I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket
For the land of the tall palm tree
Aloha Old Milwaukee, Hello Waikiki
I just stepped down from the airplane
When I heard her say,
"Waka waka nuka licka, waka waka nuka licka
Would you like a lei? Eh?"

[Chorus:]
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian
Whisper in my ear
Kicka pooka mok a wa wahini
Are the words I long to hear
Lay your coconut on my tiki
What the hecka mooka mooka dear
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian
Say the words I long to hear

It's a ukulele Honolulu sunset
Listen to the grass skirts sway
Drinking rum from a pineapple
Out on Honolulu Bay
The steel guitars all playing
While she's talking with her hands
Gimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polka
Words I understand Hey!

[Chorus]

Well, I boughta lota junka with my moolah
And sent it to the folks back home
I never had the chance to dance the hula
Well, I guess I should have known
When you start talking to the sweet wahini
Walking in the pale moonlight
Ohka noka whatta setta knocka-rocka-sis-boom-boccas
Hope I said it right Oh!

[Chorus]

Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian
Say the words I long to hear
[Spoken:] Aloha

// I Just Want To Dance With You //

I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, Wait to late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine,
So let it show, Let it shine
Oh, if we have change to make one heart of two
Then I just want to dance with you

[Chorus:]
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for,
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for,
I just want to dance with you

I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you
Yes, I did, Ain't that true
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I, and so are you
If this was a movie then we're right on cue
I just want to dance with you

[Chorus 2x]

[Ending:]
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you

// Love, Love, Love //

He stumbled through the alley with his long coat on
Nothing but a bottle in his hand
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone
Wondering what had happened to her man

[Chorus:]
Love, love, love, love
Nobody ever understands
All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.

When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine
With the kind of love no human heart can fake
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake

[Chorus]

If I should live to a ripe old age
The only lesson I may ever learn
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love
Unless you are willing to get burned

[Chorus]

All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.

// Bad Boy //

I been a bad boy
I been long gone
I been out there
I never phone home
I never gave you not one little clue where I'd been
I've been a bad boy again.

I got a way of
Fallin' in love
With angels that don't shove
You into thinkin' that you are committing a sin
I've been a bad boy again.

I've been a bad boy again
Now I've been a bad boy again
And all the trouble that I'm in
Makes me a bad boy again
I've been a bad boy again
Now I've been a bad boy again
And all the trouble that I'm in
Makes me a bad boy again

I must have walked 'round
In a real fog
I was your best friend
Now I'm a real dog
I never thought that now
Would ever catch up with then
I've been a bad boy again.

I've been a bad boy
I sung a wrong song
I took a left turn
I stayed too long
As you were thinkin' that I wasn't
Just like all other men
I've been a bad boy again.

I've been a bad boy again
Now I've been a bad boy again
And all the trouble that I'm in
Makes me a bad boy again
I've been a bad boy again
Now I've been a bad boy again
And all the trouble that I'm in
Makes me a bad boy again

// They'll Never Take Her Love From Me //

If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me

What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And watch her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the use to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
But they'll never, never take her love from me

Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'll never, never take her love from me

[Ending:]
No, they'll never, never take her love from me
