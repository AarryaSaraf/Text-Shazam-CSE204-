Album: ForBetterOrWorse

// Who's Gonna Take The Garbage Out //

I take too much abuse from you
That's all I ever get
Yeah calling a man like you a husband
Is just like calling a wild cat a pet
You'd better stop your running around
Straighten up and stop moving on
Well who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone

Each day you walk off over me
Can't you take another route
If you'd start acting like married man
Maybe we could find the way to work things out
You'll find your key won't fit the lock
If you keep on a keeping on
Well who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone

I know you think I'm running round
And that's why you're so peeved
That's another line of the same ole stuff
That I hope you don't expect me to believe
Go out tonight but don't come back
Cause you've just lost a home
But who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone

Yeah who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone
You're gonna miss me honey gal
You kidding me...

// Storms Never Last //

Storms never last do they baby
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine

I followed you down so many roads baby
I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And every road we took God knows
Our search was for the truth
And the storm brewing now won't be the last

Storms never last do they baby
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine

Storms never last do they Jessi
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine

// Falling In Love Again //

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it

Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it

Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it

Fallin' in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
What am I to do?
I can't help it

// Color Of The Blues //

Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
These things are the color of the blues
In the mail your letter came, the ink and paper looked the same
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues

Bluebird sitting in the tree seems to sympathize with me
For he's not singing like he used to do
The pretty waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues

There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
Blue must be the color angels choose
A blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues

Blue days come and blue days go, how I feel nobody knows
Life is mighty empty without you
There's a blue note in each song that I sing since you are gone
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues
Yes, blue must be the color of the blues

// I'm Tellin' You //

I'm tellin' you, you'd better change your way
I am tired of being lonely night and day
While around the town you chase
There'll be someone in your place
If you don't stop your cheatin'
I'm a-tellin' you

I'm getting wise, so honey, take a tip from me
I am not the foolish soul I used to be
If you think you're treatin' me wrong
You'll come home and I'll be gone
If you don't straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you

The road is long that never takes a turn
And the heart is hard that has no chance to yearn
I love you much too much
Oh, you big old such and such
Now you better straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you

Now you better straighten out
I'm a-tellin' you

// Remember Me //

The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said "Sweetheart, remember me."

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'till the end of eternity
But all our vows are broken now and you will never
Be the same except in memory.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear, 
A sweeter smile, a love more bold and free. 
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear. 
If they do, sweetheart, remember me.

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me.
Just to know you still remember me.

// Look At Us //

Look at us
After all these years together
Look at us
After all that we've been through
Look at us
Still leaning on each other
If you want to see
How true love should be
Then just look at us

Look at you
Still pretty as a picture
Look at me
Still crazy over you
Look at us
Still believin' in forever
If you want to see
How true love should be
Then just look at us

In a hundred years from now
I know without a doubt
They'll all look back and wonder how
We made it all work out

Chances are
We'll go down in history
When they want to see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us

Chances are
We'll go down in history
When they want to see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us

When they want to see
How true love should be
They'll just look at us

// Dim Lights, Thick Smoke //

Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-loving man

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
I'd rather have a drink with the first guy I meet
And the only home I'll know is the bar down the street

Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-loving man

A drinking and dancing to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life I'll ever understand
Go out and have your fun, you think you've played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart

Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-loving man
I'll never make a wife to a home-loving man

// Fifteen Years Ago //

I saw a man today who said he talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time
I prayed oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago

Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or go
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago

I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy but so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing from fifteen years ago

Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or go
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago
It takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know I've tried since fifteen years ago

// Cold Cold Heart //

I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

// Dreaming My Dreams //

I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
And maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind

Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you

But I won't let it change me
Not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fondest of

Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you

Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you

// Mental Cruelty //

Mental cruelty, that's what I heard him say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so he could be free
And listened to his lying words mental cruelty

Your Honor, since our marriage
My life's not been the same
I'm missing out on all the fun
And he's the one to blame

There's never any excitement now
The way there used to be
And sharing his way of life
And doing his laundry, is mental cruelty

Mental cruelty, that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty

Divorce has been granted
For many different things
Even when there's not a reason
And when no one can be blamed

With only two little words
She's on her merry way
Yes, all the woman has to claim
Is mental cruelty

Mental cruelty, that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her (his) lying words mental cruelty
And listened to her (his) lying words mental cruelty

// Mr. & Mrs. Used To Be //

Now we go our separate ways Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be
For oh so long I've loved you and I know that you loved me
But time moved on and we move far apart
It's not the way I wanted but the judge has set you free
Although you're still the first one in my heart

I just don't understand it how people such as we
Could know the love that we have known but somehow disagree
I hope that you'll be happy the same dear you from me
Now we go our separate ways Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be

At first it was like heaven on earth for you and me
But heaven's sure has changed a lot since then
I can't put all the blame on you for some belongs to me
What started out as heaven reached an end

I guess we could have made it but pride stood in our way
For love to live it must have worked we never seemed the same
And so I say goodbye now kiss the kids for me
Now we go our separate ways Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be
Now we go our separate ways Mr. and Mrs. Used To Be

// My Happiness //

Evening shadows make me blue when each weary day is through
How I long to be with you my happiness
Everyday I reminisce dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness

A million years it seems have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again there'll be no blue memories then
Where the skies are grey or blue anyplace on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you my happiness

A million years it seems have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again there'll be no blue memories then
Where the skies are grey or blue anyplace on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you my happiness

// Just Waitin' //

The old maid's a waitin' for leap year to come, the crooner's just waitin' to sing
The old cow's standin' by the Bull Durham sign, just waitin' for the grass to turn green
The bar-fly's waitin' for an easy mark, the hitchhiker's just waitin' for a ride
The lifetimer's waitin' for a prison break, the beachcomber's waitin' for the tide

Farmer's daughter's waitin' for the salesman to take her into town
The city slicker's waitin' for the country boy to lay all his money down
You know everything comes to standstill and nothing seems to make a turn
Worm must be waitin' for the early bird, I guess the early bird's waitin' for the worm

Nobody wants to do nothin' just waitin' to get a finger in the pie
Waitin' for a call for a big quiz show or a waitin' for some rich uncle to die
Katy she's waitin' at the garden gate, the moonshiner's waitin' at the still
The gambler's still waitin' for that Ace in the hole and I Jack's still waitin' for Jill

Everybody's waitin' for something, but nothing seems to turn out right
Cause the night shift's waitin' for mornin' and the burglar he's just waitin' for night
The congregation's waitin' for the preacher, the preacher's just waitin' for the groom
The groom's just waitin' for the June bride and the bride's just waitin' for June
Sunflower's waitin' for the sunshine, violet's just waitin' for dew
Bee's just waitin' for honey and honey I'm just waitin' for you
