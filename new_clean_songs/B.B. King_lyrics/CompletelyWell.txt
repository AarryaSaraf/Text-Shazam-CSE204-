// Confessin' The Blues //

Baby, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you greet it mama hopin' that you'll understand
Oh baby, mama please don't dog me around
Well, I'd rather love you baby, than anyone else I know in town

Well, because you're so nice and lovely
And you have such pleasant ways
If you take to your home I'll be there the rest of my days
That's the truth mama
Yes, you know I wouldn't lie
Well, if I don't love you baby
I swear I hope I die

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

Well now, this is my confession mama
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
It seems that I'm in heaven when you hold me in your arms
Now baby, you can have me for yourself
Well now, you was meant for me baby
And I don't want nobody else

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

// So Excited //

Oh, I'm so excited, think about you all the time 
Yes I can't wait to see you baby 
You really best of my mind 
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time 

Oh, when you touch me baby, tears of joy I'm crying 
Oh, when you hold me, chills run up and down my spine 
You're so fine, think about you all the time 

Yes, I'm so excited, I met peace with the world 
Oh, can this love be real? I'm talking about my new, new love 
You're so fine baby, wanna love you all the time 

Hey, I'm so excited, don't know what you're doing myself 
Oh, I'm so happy baby, don't need nobody else 
You're so fine baby, think about you all the time 

Yes, when I look in your eyes, you put me in a trance 
Oh, I just shake all over baby, I feel like I wanna dance 
You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time 

How can this be a dream, can this really happen to me? 
Oh, I surely loved at last, seems like a fantasy 
You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time 

I thought I've been in love, so many many times 
Oh, but this new love, has really messed up my mind 
You're so fine, think about you all the time 

You're so nice and lovin', everything you do is right 
I just can't wait, I can't wait baby 
Can't wait for you hold me tight 
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time

// No Good //

Your letter I read early this morning baby 
and I read every word you had to say 
Your letter I read early this morning baby 
And I read every word you had to say 
But if you love me like you say you do baby 
I wanna know what in the world did you go away? 

Your letter said that you're doing ok baby 
But then I read: "Please, let me come back home." 
Your letter read that you're doing ok now baby 
And then you said: "Please, let me come back home" 
You said you were so tired, so tired baby 
And you would have someone you could call your own 

Yes, my memory don't me fail on me baby 
You know I'll remember the day you left 
Yeah, my memory don't fail on me baby 
You know I'll remember the day you left 
You know you said baby: "I believe you now baby." 
That you were grown and you've been taking care yourself 

Oh, and here is my answer to you letter baby 
And the words come straight from my heart 
Oh, here is the answer to you letter baby 
And the words come straight from my heart 
Yes, I loved you then I can still love you now baby 
But I'm afraid to play the bar

// You're Losin' Me //

If you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that can 
Yes, if you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that can 
You know you're going around and cheap on me 
You're doing nothing but losing a good man 

You know life is too short to be worry, and I think you are not to understand 
Yeah, life is too short to be worry think you are not to understand 
You're keep going around and cheap on me 
You ain't doing nothing but losing a good man 

If  I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good bye 
Hey, if  I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good bye 
I got  my cloths already packed now 
I'm so hurt, I wanna cry 

Oh, can you hear me, hear me baby? 
Can you hear me? 
Oh, I got my cloths 
My cloths already packed now
I'm so hurt, I wanna cry 
I wanna know why you treat me like you do baby 
I wanna never tell me why 

Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another baby that can 
Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another baby that can 
The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a good man 

Hey, life is too short to be worry and I think you are not to understand 
Hey, I say life is too short to be worry and I think you are not to understand 
The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a good man 

What you say now!

// What Happened //

Oh, what happened to that beautiful smile?
Oh, the one that you gave me anytime we were face to face
Is it someone that's taking my place
Darling, what happened?
Oh, what happened to those fast heartbeats?
Oh, the one's, the one's that excited me so
Tell me, don't you love me, don't you love me no more
Darling, what happened?

Oh, it's so sad what a little time can do
Well, too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, what happened to the love we knew?
All of those good times, the good times, just me and you

Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing I'd like to know
Oh, don't you love me, oh, don't you care, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?

Oh, it's so sad, so sad what a little time can do
Yeah, it's too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, tell me what happened, baby, to the love we knew?
All the good times, the good times, just me and you

Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing, one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me, oh, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?

// Key To My Kingdom //

(Boy, this one here pulls the juice out of you.)

At the end of my rainbow
I seek no golden prize
For the key to my kingdom
Is the glow in your eyes

Gain and power and riches
Are thrills I'll never miss
For the key to my kingdom
Is the thrill of your kiss

Baby, I have more
Than fame and fortune
Every time I hold your hand
And my darling
When our lips meet
All the world's at my command

Yeah, if you ever
Ever should leave me
My world would tumble down
Because you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown

Oh I have more than fame and fortune
Every time I hold your hand
And my darling
When our lips meet
All the world's at my command

Yes, yes, if you ever
Ever should leave me
All of my world would tumble down
For you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown
Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom
And your love is my crown
Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom
And your love, your love is my crown

// Cryin' Won't Help You Now //

Oh no matter what you say baby
No matter what you do
The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you've been so mean to me

Oh, you must remember baby
No matter where you go
Watch those seeds just scatter woman
Because you're gonna reap just what you sow
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

Oh, the way you've been treating me woman
Just can't understand
Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman
Let you do the best you can
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you woman
'Cause you been so mean to me
Look out!

Oh, just before I leave you woman
Just before I shake your hand
I'm gonna get me a woman baby
Not to get your mad
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you now
Oh, crying won't help you baby
'Cause you been so mean to me

// You're Mean //

You've been mean
You've been mean
You've been mean
You've been mean

// The Thrill Is Gone //

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all baby
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
