// My Own Fault Darlin' //

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

// A New Way Of Driving //

Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
I ride so you bring back your memory

We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your clean clothes in my arms
We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your clean clothes in my arms
I'll ride so even
I swear I won't do harm

Well we'll ride in the mornin'
We'll ride at night
We'll ride pretty baby til we ride just right

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory

Well we'll ride in the mornin'
Ride before day
Ride pretty baby drive the blues away

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory

// The Other Night Blues //

Well I dream I heard you cry
Babe, but I heard you call my name
Well I dream I heard you cry, darling
Babe, but I heard you call my name
Well, it had to be you
Baby, to call so lonesome and plain

The other night when we were lovin'
Babe, I held you in my arms
Yes, when we were lovin', darlin'
Babe, I held you in my arms
Well, you told me that you love me
And no-one else would do me no harm

Well, you told me a lie
Babe, and you told me goodbye
Oh, you told me a lie
Darlin', and you told me goodbye
Well now, it's all your worry baby
And you have no need to cry

// B.B.'s Boogie //

B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Well I looked at the clock
The clock said four
My baby jumped up
She said, "B., let's go"

Do the B.B. boogie baby
B.B. boogie darlin'
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Grabbed my bay turned her round and round
She said, "B.'s the boogiest man in town"

B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
Me and my baby do the boogie all night

B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
She said, "love me baby and squeeze me tight"

The B.B. boogie
B.B. boogie darlin'
B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

// Walkin' And Cryin' //

When I first met you, said you would be mine
Found out later you was tellin' me a lie
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now if there's one thing that I just can't stand
Can't stand to see you with another man
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

I did all for you, did all I could
All I did darlin', it didn't do me no good
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now I'm goin' on, goin' on my way
I know you don't love me now darlin'
But you will some old day
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

// Everything I Do Is Wrong //

Well, I can't get along no matter what I do
Well, we can't get along no matter what I do
Yes, everything I do is wrong
No matter what I do

Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time
Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time
Well, if we don't get together baby
Won't be no fault of mine

Lay it down
Alright then

Well, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now
Oh, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now
We can't get together, baby
You were no good no how

// I Gotta Find My Baby //

Well I hate to see the sun sets in the West
'Cos I know my whole life gonna be a solid mess
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well, I walked this town from door to door
Gal I love can't find no more
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well I've looked all around trying to find me a wife
I got to find my big legged brownskin share the rest of my life
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

// That Ain't The Way To Do It //

Hey baby, you ain't treating me right
You go off everyday and don't come home til night
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well I'm pickin' you up and takin' you to my house
Now you're up and you're treating me like a mouse
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well I takin' you into my house and did everything I could
You told everybody in the neighborhood
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well if you got a little woman and she won't treat you right
Beat her three times a day and whoop her a little at night
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

// B.B.'s Blues //

If you love me, baby
Why don't you write me sometime
If you, if you love me, baby
Why don't you let me
Hear from you sometime
You don't do nothing
But keep me worried
You just keep me worried
All the time

You know I think about you, baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
Oh you know, you know
You know I think about you, baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
It seems like you would treat me
A little better, baby
It seems like you would be

A little nicer and kind

Let me love you one more time, baby
Let me love you one more time
Before you go away
Let me, let me love you
One more time, baby
One more time before you go away
If you let me love you one more time
I think we can talk it over
Before you go away

Here I am, baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh here I am, baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh I don't want you to leave me, baby
Don't want you to go
To no other man

// She's Dynamite //

Met a lot women who could love alright
But nothing like the woman I met this night
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now men don't blame me because I've been around
I don't understand what's she's putting down
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
But she'll show you how, you just tell her when
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

She's got a peal handled pistol
A knife and a razor too
You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now you can whip it, whop it
Or hang it on the wall
Or throw it out the window
She'll pitch herself a ball
She's dynamite, well she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

// Questionnaire Blues //

I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
Yes, if I have to commit murder
Won't have to (???)

I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
And a red, white and blue fag
Wear it in my right hand

Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Well I meet her one mornin'
Down by that old Red Sea
