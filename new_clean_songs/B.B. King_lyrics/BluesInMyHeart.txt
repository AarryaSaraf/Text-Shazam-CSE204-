// You're Gonna Miss Me //

Let me tell you people a low down thing or two
I just can't stand that old evil way she do
She gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Came home this mornin', she wouldn't let me in
She said, "Go away baby, I got too many friends"
You're gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Hard to love a woman when the woman don't love you
She'll treat you so low down 'n' dirty, 'till you won't know what to do
You're gonna miss me, hey, you're gonna miss me baby
You're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and gone

Well, bye-bye baby, I hope we meet again
You won't be so evil when you won't have too many men
You're gonna miss me baby, yeah, you're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and gone

// Troubles Don't Last //

Oh just let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, I know you've had a hard time baby
But remember troubles don't always last

Oh you tried so hard to tell me you love me
And I didn't believe a word you said
You tried so hard to tell me you love me, woman
And I didn't believe a word you said
But now I'm older and I'm wiser, baby
And now I can understand your ways

Oh, I'm at your mercy, woman
Do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm at your mercy, baby
Just do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm not asking for sympathy baby
Yes I was wrong and I must pay

Oh, I'm asking for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
Well, I'm asking you for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
You just say the word now baby
And I'll do anything you tell me to

// Your Letter //

Yes your letter reached me early this morning baby 
and I read every word you had to say 
I said your letter reached me early this morning baby 
and I read every word you had to say 
But you know I just don't understand you waman 
If you love me why in the world did you go away

Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home." 
Your letter said that you're doing ok
But then it read: "Please, let me come back home." 
Yes, you said you were so tired, so tired baby 
And you wanted someone you could call your own 

But memories don't fail me woman 
I remember the day you left 
Oh my memories don't fail me baby
I remember the day you left 
Well you know you told me then and I believe you now woman 
That you were grown and you've been take care of yourself 

So now here is my answer baby 
And the words come straight from my heart 
Well, here is the answer to you letter woman
And the words come straight from my heart 
Yeah it's against my will I know
I could love you still baby
But baby I just can't play the part

// I Can't Explain //

Oh, I can't explain baby
But heaven only knows why
Oh, I can't explain
And heaven only knows why
Yes, I'll be in love with you baby
I guess until the day I die

You are to me, baby
What the water is to the sea
Oh, you are to me, baby
What the water is to the sea
I only want your love, baby
So tell me why don't you want me

Yes, I don't believe in miracles
I believe what's to be will be
Yes, I don't believe, I don't believe in miracles
I only believe what's to be will be
Yes but if I did believe in miracles, baby
Baby, you would be a miracle to me

Yes, you're my first thought baby
Yes my last and in between
Oh, you're my first thought baby
Yes my last and in between
I say you're the greatest champion baby
Oh that any man has ever seen

// Wrong Road //

I know you've been cheatin' on me baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
Oh I know you've been cheatin' on me, woman
And I know you don't mean me no good
That's why I blame myself
I didn't treat you like I should

Oh, I was too good to you baby
I gave you everything I own
Yes, I was too good to you woman
I gave you everything I own
That's why I blame myself
Every time you do me wrong

You got your eyes wide open woman
But you're travelling down the wrong road
Oh you got your eyes wide open baby
And you're travelling down the wrong road
Yes, a wine drinkin' and cheatin', woman
is one thing I can't afford

// I Need You Baby //

Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Oh I need you baby
Come on back home to me
I'll make it all up to you, woman
Just you wait around and see

I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
I know I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
Yes I was young and foolish
I didn't know you was the one

Now I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Oh I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Yes, come on home now baby
I want you to come on home tonight

Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Well I need you woman
I need a good woman around
Every night about this time baby
My love comes tumbling down

// So Many Days //

So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
I was too blue to live
And to mean to die

You've been so mean baby
You've been so mean to me
Baby, you've been so mean
You've been so mean to me
I've got to get even with you woman
You just hang around and see

Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Yes, the way I used to love you woman
Baby that's the way I hate you now

Yes, you can pack your clothes baby
You can pack your clothes and go
Pack your clothes, woman
You can pack your clothes and go
I want you to know baby
You ain't no better than the little girl I had before

// Downhearted //

I'vee been down hearted
Ever since the day we met 
Baby I've been down hearted
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Baby, how blue can you get? 

My love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes my love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby, how blue can you get? 

Oh you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
Yes you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get baby 
The answer's right here in my heart 

I gave you a brand new Ford 
But you said: I want a Cadillac 
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
And you said: thanks for the snack 
I let you live in my pent house 
You said it just a shack 

I gave you seven children 
And now you wanna give them back 
I said I've been down hearted baby 
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Tell me how blue can you get?

// Strange Things //

Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happening 
And something may happen to you

Well, if you know you don't want me baby
Why in the world would you let me be
Yes if you know you don't want me baby
Tell me why would you let me be
Because it's better to live without you baby
Than to live on in misery

Yeah, midnight finds me crying
Oh daylight finds me crying too
Yes midnight finds me crying
Daylight finds me crying too
You better straighten your mind pretty baby
Because something may happen to you

// Love My Baby //

I've got a right to love my baby
She treats me just like a king
I've got a right to love my woman
She treats me just like a king
Yes, she's my mind, body and soul
Yes, my baby, she can do 'most anything

Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all-around standby
Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people
She's my mother when I wanna cry
Yes, I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, can't you see the reason why?

Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman
She's always here by my side
Oh, my sweet understanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
Yes and when it comes to kind treating people
My baby's an angel in disguise

Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover
Yes, she calls me her little baby boy
Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy

// My Baby's An Angel //

I don't mean to hurt you, baby and I'm sorry if I do
I don't really mean to hurt you, woman and I'm sorry if I do
Why should I make myself miserable, baby?
Baby, you know I'm human too
Oh, please don't hate me
Because I know we just don't belong
Oh baby, please don't hate me
I know we just don't belong
I found me someone who wants me
Baby, won't you please set me free?

I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, I have to admit you've been an angel, baby
And I'm grateful for the wife you've been
Oh, but now my heart belongs to another
So to hold me baby, is really sin

I want you to try to forgive me
Babe, and please try to understand
I want you to please, please forgive me, baby
Babe and please try to understand
You know I didn't make myself, woman
And it's not my fault, got somebody else

// My Baby's Dynamite //

Met a lot women who could love alright
But nothing like the woman I met this night
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now men don't blame me because I've been around
I don't understand what's she's putting down
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
But she'll show you how, you just tell her when
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

She's got a peal handled pistol
A knife and a razor too
You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now you can whip it, whop it
Or hang it on the wall
Or throw it out the window
She'll pitch herself a ball
She's dynamite, well she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

// My Sometime Baby //

Yeah my baby sometimes, sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
Yes I've got a sometimey baby
Sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
And when I think about my baby loving me
Sometimes she do and sometimes she don't

Yes sometimes she's sweet like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Yes I said my baby's sweet
Sometimes like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Well to be in love with a woman like this
Sometimes you don't know which is witch

I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
Yeah you may be right in your thinking people
But I know my baby's gonna make everything all right
