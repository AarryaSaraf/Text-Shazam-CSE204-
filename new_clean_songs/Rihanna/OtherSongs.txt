// We Found Love //

[Narration:]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

// Lost In Paradise //

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

(Bass slap)

What am I supposed to do with this heart? [3x]

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

// Answer //

You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops falling in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wondering if you're giving

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops falling in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
You don't have to answer

// Bitch I'm Special //

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's got the most inflated ego of them all?
Thinks he can do a booty call
That thinks he is so lovable
That thinks he is the perfect man
That I shouldn't of ever let go
And that's why I let him go
The first thing he wants in the morning ain't you
It's all about him in the morning, baby
You got a boy like I had, using you
A boy like that is using baby
Let me help you understand the sexy grin from ear to ear
Girl, if you were inside his head

He handled me like merchandise
Hate to admit the down payment was his bedroom eyes (Yeah)
Ay, then after he passed home base, he started to pump the breaks
My heavenly bliss destroyed
He flipped a U-ey in my face
I was the grand prize that he hardly had to chase
Said goodbye 'cause I coulda sworn I heard him say

You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)

// Born Again //

I give my all to this place
I give my soul or whatever it takes, never run away
I've got enough angels to storm the gates
I'm not afraid, behold the brave
I'll have it no other away
I miss the emergence and these moments of you
The mere reflection of me
That mirror can't change it's view

So until those rivers run out
They are stormy wherever you are
I'll be there, we carry on (We carry on)
Born again (Ooh)

I give my all to this place (I give my all to this place)
I give my whole soul and whatever it takes, never run away
And I relive this just to see your face again
I know that you'll do the same, born again

Just tell me what I need to do (I'd die and come back)
I'd die and come back just to love you (I'd die and come back)
Just tell me, I'm begging you (Just tell me what I need to do)
Just tell me what I need to do, oh

// Cockiness (Love It) (Remix) //

Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearing fox furs, rocking oxfords
Eating oxtails, sipping Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers looking awkward
So much dick riding that my cock hurt
(Pause), we running clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it
Get it?

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it

I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Hold it down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie
(I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)
Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day
Be my Harlem
And me St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do it this way

No one can do ya

// Diamonds (Remix) //

We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, high society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxing, relaxing, shooting some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The DeLorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond

// Emergency Room //

I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
'Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shocking (shocking)
It's on receipts here to tell you went shopping (shopping)
You bought some Nike shoes, but why you buying stockings?

Boy how could you lie to me? Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'mma let it go
I ain't standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

Well, I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi
Saw your man in the club I thought he was out of town doing business
Said that he'd be back in three weeks?"
And now I'm mad, sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures

Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'm 'a let it go
Can't standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listening to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper?
You know them haters
You hear that 808, the drum
That's my heart beat, I'm going numb
I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
I'm going under cardiac arrest

You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG

// FourFiveSeconds //

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shining, I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talking trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinking, "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinking, "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (mhm)
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Four, five seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want

// Goodbye //

I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I delay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Oh, oh
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye

// Happy //

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like spending time with you
Just doing absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When you're at work, putting on your T-shirt
And I love it, absolutely love it

It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like walking through the sprinklers
Smelling every flower one by one
Mm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah
It's like telling me you love me
Showing me you love me, baby, my pretty baby

It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like Saturday, oh
Four day weekend, oh
Hiding and seeking with you
Like we do, it's beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

// Hatin' On The Club //

Now to sing her latest recording
It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna

Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more laying up in your arms
No calling, saying you want me back
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that?

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar
Got me crying

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front
Coming out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar
Got me crying

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now we're, now we're like whoa

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
But now, now we're like whoa
You got me hating on the club
You took my love
Oh, you took my love

You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—
Club, club, club, club
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on the—

// It Just Don't Feel Like Xmas (Without You) //

Another day, another reminder that you're not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars
It's crazy how we didn't know then
That we'd ever be apart

I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you, you

Another tear, another regret boy, that you're so far away
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day
Remember when we took the sleigh ride
Remember singing by the fire
There's to much that's in the daylight
I keep reliving you and I

I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you

Time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars
It's crazy how we didn't know then
That we'd ever be apart

I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
It just don't feel like Christmas
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you, ooh baby

See I tried but it just ain't right, right without you

Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

Hate! You keep askin' me where I'm from
Hate! About the borders and, "Did I run?"
Hate! Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
Hate! There's a light and dark army, which side you choose? Oh
Hate! If not now then when?
Hate! And if not me then who?
Hate! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends

[Rihanna:]
I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'

And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

[Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

// Lift Me Up //

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love
When you depart keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound

Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe
Safe and sound

Lift me up
Hold me down (Hold me down)
Keep me safe (Keep me close)
Safe and sound (Safe and sound)

Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe
We need light
We need love

Lift me up (Lift me up, in your arms)
Hold me down (I need love, I need love, I need love)
Keep me close (Hold me, hold me)
Safe and sound (Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me)
Lift me up (Hold me, hold me)
Hold me down (Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me)
Keep me safe
We need light
We need love

// Masquerade //

I'm painting my smile, drying my tears
Cover it all (cover it all)
You wear a disguise, hiding your fears
Put up a wall

But underneath it all that love we had is gone
We already let go
But we put on a show, so nobody knows
'Cause we ain't ready to fall

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts too much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!

You're all that I know, so comfortable
But the feeling is gone
And even though we need more
We're scared of being alone, so the show goes on

If we took off our mask then we could never last
'Cause we'll be forced to see
It's all to make believe
'Cause we're not who we used to be

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts too much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!

I'm wiping my smile off
Letting the tears come streaming down
You take your disguise off
Bringing your walls down to the ground
We be screaming inside
We can finally let it go
The truth is out now
We're face to face
Time to put it into this

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts to much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!

Ooh, the late night Skype sex, on that young shit
Girl, you keep it one hundred, always gon' hold me down

Let's elevate, just elevate
Yeah, girl, let me take you for a ride

Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thing on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body

And even if there is a crowd, let 'em see it

Just let 'em all just say what they wanna say, that's how I feel, 'cause I'm in love
And the temperature just heats up when I'm with you
Don't be scared, when I start to go down and I lick you
Rubbing and kissing and licking on your body when I go down and oh, I'm gon' miss you
And I need your body right now 'cause I know it's an issue
And I'm hyperventilating right now, I can't breathe if I ain't with you
I need your body like right now, I need your body like right now
Lay your head, on my bed, baby, tell me if you want the lights down
Your property, treat me like I'm your property

Your property, treat me like I'm your property
Do what you wanna, take command, I'm about to be your biggest fan (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Looking for too many places
Searching high and low for you, I'm stronger when I'm close to you
I'm seeing all familiar faces
Girl, it's all about you, only you in my life
And I say, "You like playing with my heart?"
Baby, please don't do this to me
'Cause I'm in love, can I get a little bit?
One more kiss? Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna miss it

Baby, let me change your life, promise it will be alright
Baby, take my hand tonight, let me set you free now
Sweating like a waterbed on me, keep putting that thing on me
Like you never did before, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, right there, right there, right there
Put it up right there, I'm gon' explore all of your body
Put it up right there, put it up right there, I love, I love you
I'm gon' explore all of your body (Girl, I'ma do it all for you)

// Redemption Song //

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

So won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Redemption songs
Songs of freedom

Love is great, love is fine (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

If I'm bad, tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cause the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better

You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping 'bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I'm upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rocking with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock

// Sledgehammer //

I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit a wall and watched it fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving's failure, yeah

I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit a wall and watched it fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

// Slower To Heal //

Overnight oh
Overnight oh

I wish the pain would go away
I wish they'd find a cure today
I asked the doctor what it means
He says things ain't as bad as what they seem

My heart is working over time
To me it's broke inside
And this heart it needs to see the light
Cause I'm stuck
At least that's what it feels like

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never
It's not gon' happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gon' happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
So I'm slower to heal

It's like I'm in a traffic jam
Being pulled out of quicksand
(I'm out of quicksand)
I'm like a newly planted tree
I wish you could find it in yourself
To be patient with me

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never
It's not gon' happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gon' happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
Wish I could kill this pain that I feel
But it don't happen that way, never

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break

Sak Pase, my Port-Au-Princes
my Haitian gods and all of my princesses
Our condolences as you fighting against this
We're right by your side while we trying to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that's left, accept them into your garden
So here's my theory, the country's already starving
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So let's get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them 'til they get strong again
When the sky falls

Can't wait until tomorrow
Haiti a mi amor
Haiti, mon amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
Oh no

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break

Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can't rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon' catch a break, my friend lost his mother, and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain't done, it can't end like that
Nah, not like this, tomorrow's survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory's alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break

It's not the angels that are on their way
It's not the bells of Santa Trinita
The people waiting in positions vacant
For hands to help not just to pray

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won't break

Haïti va s'élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble
(Not gonna leave you stranded)

We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break

// Suicide //

Everywhere is still
Everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
Suddenly I'm scared to be apart
The days are dark when you're not around
The air is getting hard to breathe
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep

Loving you is suicide
I don't know should I go or should I stay
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
But I heard you say you loved me
That's the part I can't forget
And I wish that you come save me
'Cause I'm standing over the edge

I should let you go
Tell myself the things I need to hear
But my brain is wired wrong
That's why I'm loving you when you're not here
Feels like I drown in your every word
And every breath that's in between
Somehow you get me where it really hurts
It's killing every part of me

Loving you is suicide
I don't know should I go or should I stay
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
But I heard you say you loved me
That's the part I can't forget
And I wish that you come save me
Boy 'cause I'm standing over the edge

Loving you is suicide
And my world's about to break
And I had as much as I can take
And love is a long way down

Loving you is suicide
And it's getting harder everyday
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
And I'm way past every moment
But I'm still determined to fight
And I know it's taking all my strength
To keep these emotions alive
Loving you is suicide

// Tip Pon Toe //

I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to wine down
And find ourselves a corner
Six pack with braids and green eyes
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (wining it slow now)

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go
Here we go now

I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear
Torn apart this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wine it slow (ooh)

If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe
Wheel it back now here we go

Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
(And I'm going crazy)
Now you're here
You can show me just how you do
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
(I've been waiting on you)
Now you're here
You can show me just how you do

// Umbrella (Cinderella Remix) //

Remix
Uh huh, uh huh (yeah, Rihanna)
(Chris Brown)
Uh huh, uh huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones, let it rain
I hydroplane in the bank coming down with the Dow Jones (ay, ay, ay, ay)
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (ay, ay, ay, ay)
We fly higher than weather, in G5s or better
You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (ay, ay, ay, ay)
With little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? (ay, ay, ay, ay)

You have my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

You're becoming a dream to me, a fairy tale fantasy
Nothing can never compare an image to my memory
Girl, I'm asking, could you be my queen? A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there, it's something we both share because

When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl, it's getting late, and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car, I ain't tryna stress you
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

You can run into my arms
It's OK don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah, you ready?)
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'm 'a stick it out 'til the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress you
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella ella—ella—ella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby, it's raining (raining)
Baby, come into me (oh)
Come into me
It's raining (Rihanna)
Oh baby, it's raining (Rihanna)
You can always come into me
Come into me

// Whipping My Hair //

I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

We're flashing pictures
Kodak moment memories
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world, just for you and I

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

All them girls in the club, get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy, keep doing it right

// Who's That Chick //

Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dance floor, bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard, blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the Crazy Juice
This will end up on the news

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

My heart is a dancer, beating like a disco drum
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)

// World Peace //

In a perfect world
We would make love over war
With our hands in the air
And no problems and no cares, oh no, oh no
Oh America, all the way down to Africa
We keep singing as the world spins
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
And round and round and round

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round

In a perfect world
There would be no lonely ones
We would keep our hands in the air
With no problems no cares oh no, oh no
From London to Japan
Everyone woman, boy, girl, and man
Come on, come dance with me

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round

Maximum bass!

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round
