// That Was Just Your Life //

Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction
A premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny…I deny 

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow but I want the world to die

Like a release from prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave 
From way back then
Like a general without a mission 
Until the war will start again…start again

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot 
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your life

// The End Of The Line //

Need...more and more
Tainted misery
Bleed...battle scars
Chemical affinity
Reign...legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain...rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke...asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch...kill the light
Incinerate celebrity
Reaper...butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline...redefine
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
You've reached the end of the line

Time...choke the clock
Steal another day
Die...faithfully
Narcissistic fade away
Twisted...jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker...chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell...
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind...
Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line

// Broken, Beat & Scarred //

You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong

Rise, fall, down, rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong
Rise, fall, down, rise again
What don't kill you make you more strong

Through black days
Through black nights
Through pitch black insides

Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you make you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you make you more strong

Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you make you more strong

They scratch me
They scrape me
They cut and rape me

Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

Breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in the hot sun's glory
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard
We die hard
We die hard

// The Day That Never Comes //

Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swear!

// All Nightmare Long //

Luck. Runs. Out.
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn
Still life
Incarnation
Still life
Infamy

Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.

You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

1.2.

Luck. Runs. Out.

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life
Immolation
Still life
Infamy

Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come?
What's to be?

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.

You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck. Runs. Out.

You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Your luck runs out

// Cyanide //

Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh peace at last!

Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

// The Unforgiven III //

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone 
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast down with his ship
Fading in the shadows now

A castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

// The Judas Kiss //

When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
Strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

// My Apocalypse //

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse...Go!

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, bones they all shatter
I start to see the end. In. Me.
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
