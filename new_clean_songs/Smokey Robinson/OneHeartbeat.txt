// Just To See Her //

Just to see her
Just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again
One more time

If I could feel her warm embrace
See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it, no
I can't fight it, oh
It's so hard to live without the love
She gave to me

Doesn't she know it?
I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she
Really needs me again?

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again

(Just to see her)
I want to see her
(Just to hold her)
Hold her, hold her, hold her
(Just to see her)
See her
(Just to touch her)
Touch her

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightens up my everyday
Makes me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again
(I've got to see her again)

(Just to see her)
It would, it would, it would
(Just to see her)
Make me feel so good
(Just to see her)
If I, if I could only see her again
(Just to see her again)

(Just to see her)
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
(Just to see her)
Oh, don't you know it's true?
(Just to see her)
If I could only see her again

// One Heartbeat //

Ooh, baby

Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight, why do they say love is blind
Slow down, we don't have to move fast
'Cause the love that is real is made to last

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

We paint a picture walkin' down the street
Leaves are fallin', baby, so are we
Hand in hand, that's the way it should be
How could somethin' so easy make me feel so complete

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Take it easy, oh
I want o feel your every emotion
Don't talk
And we'll makin' love in slow motion
Oh, slow motion, baby
Oh, slow motion, baby

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat

One heartbeat
One heartbeat
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat
If we take it at a time

// It's Time To Stop Shoppin' Around //

You gave me space
Girl, you gave me air
You let me run and rip
And when I've done my trip
You've been waitin' right here
You gave me leeway
You gave me my way
Now you're actin' like
You're 'bout to give me the highway
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

I've been a rover
Girl, I've been a mover
You just swallowed your pride
And stood on the side
And let me maneuver, well
You gave me freedom
You gave me rope
I haven't already hung myself I hope
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Well, it's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
Girl, don't you know
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

At first it was nice, takin' Mama's advice
And play the game of pick and choose
But then along came you, and that's when I knew
I'd found that woman that I don't want to lose

My way was a dream
Girl, your way is real
You had to shake me up
Just to wake me up
And show me how I feel, mmm...
I showed you my way
You showed me your way
Now you're actin' like
You're 'bout to show me the doorway
I better straighten up

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Don't you know that
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl, well
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

It's time to stop shoppin' around
(Better stop shoppin' around)
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
(Gotta stop Dukin' of Earl)
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
Yeah, and get myself back in your arms again
(Well, well, well)

It's time to stop shoppin' around
Don't you know that
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl, well
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
And get myself back in your arms again

It's time to stop shoppin' around
(Better stop shoppin' around)
It's time to stop Dukin' of Earl
(Gotta stop Dukin' of Earl)
It's time to stop Jimmy Mackin'
Yeah, and get myself back in your arms again...

// Why Do Happy Memories Hurt So Bad //

Baby's on the run, there she goes
Somethin' that I've done, I suppose
Made baby cry and now, I'm all alone
I hope by and by, baby will come back home
When I remember, the happiness we had
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad

Think about the good times, let the bad times fade
That's a good philosophy, but I'm afraid
Good memories only feel good with someone to share them
But when you're alone it's much harder to try to bear them
A thought that makes you smile can still make you sad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do they hurt so bad, why do they hurt so bad

Occupy your time they tell me, get yourself a hobby
They mean well, but I'm not about to let them rob me
Of the only way I can be with you at all
It's here in my memory and I've got total recall
Even when parting is sweet, it's still sad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Why do they hurt so bad
Why do happy memories hurt so bad
Hurt so bad, hurt so bad

Hurt so bad, memories, memories
Memories, memories
Hurt so bad...

// You Don't Know What It's Like //

Walking around in a daze
This feeling took so long to come
I'm never gonna be the same again, yeah
What happened to my common sense
I thought that I at least had some
But love can make fools out of the wisest
And now I'm a man who recognizes

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
No, no

People say I'm acting strange
Like I'm in the twilight zone
It's got to be love that's got me out of my mind
I'm somewhere in total disconnection
'Cause I had a total misconception

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
It's nothing like in movies or magazines
Or those romantic novels they write
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like

This love is not like my dreams
Or any fantasies I've had
It's taken me to both extremes
Sometimes it's better than good
Sometimes it's worse than bad

Oh, it's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
It's nothing like in movies or magazines
Or those romantic novels they write
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like...

// What's Too Much //

I could feel you the moment that you walked into the room
Oh, baby, oh
What I felt I wondered if I felt too much too soon
Ooh... baby, ooh
I can't help myself, something draws me to you
How in just a moment's time can all of me pursue you

What's too much
When the fascination keeps on growing by the minute
What's too much
Should I hold back something or just throw my whole self in it
What's too much

Baby, you touched me the moment that I looked into your eyes
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I was captured by the gaze that caught me by surprise
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I want to pay my full attention in advance
I don't know if that's too much, but I'm willing to take the chance

What's too much
What's the feeling in it telling me, is there such a rule
What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much

You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything, but maybe that's too much
That's too much

What's too much...

You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything, but maybe that's too much

What's too much
What's the feeling in it telling me, is there such a rule
What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much
Is a feeling something anyone knows how to measure
What's too much
Should you try to stop it at a certain point of pleasure

What's too much
Tell me, tell me
What's too much
What's too much
What's too much
What's too much...

// Love Brought Us Here Tonight //

Oh, oh, oh... baby

I don't know where you've been
All I know is when
We said goodbye, we thought it was forever
Others we both have tried
Just made us both decide
Our happiness is when we are together

Love, love made us feel so right
Feel so right, oh...
Love, love was our guiding light
Oh, yeah
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here tonight

It could be loneliness
Or a test to see who's the best
Or two people's prayers that didn't go unheard
There are many reasons why
We might be here, but I
Think I can sum them up in just one word

Love, love made us feel so right
Love, love was our guiding light
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here

No doubt in my mind
We were meant to be
I was led to you
You were sent to me

Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Oh, brought us here tonight

Love, love made us feel so right, yeah
Oh, love, love was our guiding light
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here

Love, love made us feel so right
Made everything feel right
Sing it, sing it, sing it to me
Love, love brought us here tonight
Let me feel your love
(Feel it, feel, feel)
I wanna feel your love
Love, love made us feel so right
Love, love, love, love, love
Oh, oh, love
Love, love was our guiding light
Let me feel it, let me feel it...

// Love Don't Give No Reason //

I do believe my mom and my dad must
Have been the happiest couple that I've ever seen
He used to bring her flowers or a gift just
Because the sky was blue and the grass was green
But I can recall
The night that daddy came and shocked us all
Said this is goodbye
Through both their tears
I remember momma asking why, he said...

Love don't give no reason
Love don't give guarantee
Love may last a season
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
I just don't know about love
Nobody knows

Sometimes a man just out to have a good time
Can meet somebody who captures his heart and mind
Sometimes a woman who's faithful to her man can still
Fall for somebody else against her own will
We were two lovers
I thought that I was doing everything right for you
But you found another
And when I asked you what I did
Or what I didn't do, you said...

Love don't give no reason
Love don't give guarantee
Love may last a season
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
Just don't know about love, ooh...

Love is like lightning
You don't know when or where it's gonna strike
Love can be frightening
Sometimes you love somebody that you don't even like

Love don't give no reason
Well, well, well
Love don't give guarantee, ooh...
Love may last a season, oh...
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love
Just don't know about love

Don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know
Just don't know about love, ooh...

Love don't give no reason, well
Love don't give guarantee, no, no
Love may last a season, oh...
Or love may last eternally
See, love don't change for you or me
Just to know about love

Nobody knows about love
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know about love
Just don't know about love...

// Keep Me //

You're not a cell, oh, no
But a prisoner am I
Caught in your spell, oh, yeah
The web and the fly
Prisoners usually only dream
Of one day bein' free
My dream is you lock me up
And throw away the key

Keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself

You're not a cage, oh, no
But I am your inmate
Let's just engage in each other
Baby, I can't wait
A voluntary captive
All my time is spoken for
I could not escape you
Even through an open door

Keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me)
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me, keep me)

I'm guilty of love you
So make me serve
A lifetime of being with you
'Cause that's what I think I deserve
That's what I think I deserve

Ooh... baby...

Prisoners usually only dream
Of one day bein' free
My dream is you lock me up
And throw away the key
There's just no place
Nowhere else on earth I'd rather be

Oh, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself
(Keep me, keep me)
I say, keep me, keep me
Baby, please keep me
Keep me for yourself, ooh...
(Keep me, keep me)

Keep me for yourself, ooh, yeah
(Keep me, keep me, keep me)
Keep me for your own
(Keep me, keep me, keep me)
Keep me locked away and love me good
Make me stay, then you'll never be alone
Keep me, keep me, keep me...
