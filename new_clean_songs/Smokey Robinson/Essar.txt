// And I Don't Love You //

The whippoorwill whippoor-won't
The weeping willows laughing
Sunday is moonlight
All wrong is alright
And I don't love you

Lorelei is Laura Truth
The fallen leaves are rising
So low is so high
Hello is goodbye
And I don't love you

When positive is negative
And make-believe's the real thing, yeah
When bottoms up and everybody's
Walking on the ceiling, uh-huh
Still I doubt if even that
Could make me lose the feeling, yeah
I'll never lose the feeling
Oh, I'll never lose the feeling

When morning comes in evening
And daily comes nightly, oh, baby
Or even if your love for me
Slackens up slightly, oh...
I doubt if I ever could
Take your love lightly, ooh...
I can never take your love lightly
Oh, take your love lightly
Lightly, lightly
Oh, take your lightly

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh...
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh...

Yeah...

What never was is here again, yeah
The past is in the future
Black and white rainbows
Colorful shadows
And I don't love you

When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening

When morning comes in evening
And daily comes nightly
Baby, ooh, oh, baby, ooh...
Or even if your love for me
Slackens up slightly
Don't start slacken up
Don't stop backing up
I doubt if I ever could
Take your love lightly
Never, never take your love lightly
Oh, take your love lightly

When positive is negative
And make-believe's the real thing
Baby, ooh, oh, baby, ooh...
When bottoms up and everybody's
Walking on the ceiling
Walking, talking, upside-down
Still I doubt if even that
Could make me lose the feeling, yeah
Never, never, never lose the feeling

Feels so good
(Never lose the feeling)
Feeling, feeling
I'll never lose the feeling
Never lose the feeling
Feels so good, baby
Never, never, never, never...

// Train Of Thought //

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride

I've got a one track mind
Headed in your direction
The wheels keep on turning
Every thought concerning
What I can do to get me next to you

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Ride, ride, ride
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Oh, come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Oh, come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride

Tune in on my wavelength
The power of my suggestion
Mental instigations
Intimate vibrations
Calling to me through telepathy

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought
Come on and ride, come on and ride
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ooh...

Come on, ride, ride
Come on, ride, ride, baby

Come on, ride, ride, baby, ride
Come on, ride, ride

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ooh...
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside
Oh, come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh...
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride, ride

Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, oh, yeah
Come on, baby
Know my mind inside, oh...
Come on, baby
Ride my train of thought, ride, ride
Come on, baby
You've got a ticket to ride...

// Why Are You Running From My Love //

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

Could it be love has played
A cruel game on you
Did you believe in dreams
That never did come true
Then someone caught your heart
To end your lonely nights
Whispering promises
That faded with the light

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

Girl, I know what it's like
To watch my castles fall
Thought I had love for sure
I had nothing at all
So I turned off my heart
Claimed that this was the end
But now that you're in my life
I want to love again

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

We've both known pain
Let's now know joy
Don't let our sorrows
Ruin our tomorrows now

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of, thinking of
Why are you running
What could you think I'm thinking of

Why, why, why, why, why
Why are you running from my love

You know you're out
Stopping me to count on time, ooh, baby
You know you're out
Stopping me to count on time, ooh, baby

Why, oh, why, oh
(Why are you running)
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, why
(Why are you running)
I wanna love again
I wanna love again, I wanna love again
(Why are you running)
I wanna again
(Why are you running)
Why, oh, why, oh...

// Gone Forever //

There ain't nothing like the love of a woman
Nothing feels so right than the love of a woman
And I am feeling down and blue

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
Gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

Now I'm not saying that I want to be loved
By nobody but you, but, oh...
You see, I feel just like a fool
And you know that it's true

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
You're gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

What I'd give, oh, yes, I'd give
For one more night
And I'm just a fool without you in my life
'Cause once where there was fire
Only lonely ashes blow in the wind
And it's hard dealing with the feeling
That I won't be loving you again
And I've lost my best friend

'Cause you're gone forever, gone forever
You're gone forever, gone forever
Gone are the ways that we felt inside

Oh, my love, oh, my love, goodbye

// Close Encounters Of The First Kind //

A look
Everything always starts with a look
A stolen glance
You see somebody quite by chance
The eyes
So much can be revealed through the eyes
That certain glow
That little sparkle that let's you know
This could be the start of everything
Bigger than the both of you
You know what it is
When he wants to be hers
And she wants to be his

Close, close encounters of the first kind
Close, close encounters of the first kind

A touch
You'll never know what you'll feel from a touch
Sweet chemistry
If this is the time, then let it be
Take this magic moment
And run away to ecstasy
You know what I mean
Touching somebody with nothing in between

Close, oh, close
Close encounters of the first kind
Close encounters
Close, ooh, close
Close encounters of the first kind

Close
Close

A kiss
Who knows the end results of a kiss
Where will it lead
I think a kiss is just what you need
To stimulate the part that makes
Holding out became giving in
You know what it's called
When what you're thinking 'bout
Is giving it all

Close, oh, close
Close encounters of the first kind
Close encounters
Close, ooh, close
Close encounters of the first kind
Close encounters

Close encounters, yeah, close encounters
Close encounters of the first kind
Close, close, close, close, close encounters
Close encounters, yeah
Close encounters of the first kind...

// Little Girl Little Girl //

Little girl, little girl
Stay away from me, oh
'Cause you know when you come around
It's harder to resist you now, oh
When I first felt grown and left home
You were just a baby
And the last thing on my mind
Was you'd ever be a lady
Little darling, now you're all grown up
And the change is drastic
Got me thinking just to be with you
Would be so fantastic
And I've made up my mind
That the very next time
You look at me the way you do
I'm just gonna say to you, ooh...

Little girl, little girl
I think I've got to have you, yeah
Wonder what your folks would think about
What I'm thinking if they only knew
Would your mama be hurt
Or put herself in your position, uh, uh
'Cause your mama looks so good right now
I know she still get propositioned
And your daddy will be on my side
If he goes by his man thing
Yeah, you're a woman
But the fact that you're his baby
Might cloud his understanding
Still, I've made up my mind
That the very next time
Your passion for me is revealed
I'm gonna show you how I feel

I hope the world don't mind our love
But under the circumstances
I want to be with you so much
'Til I'm gonna take my chances, oh, baby

Little girl, little girl
I'm old enough to be your dad, yeah
But this need that I have for you
Is something that I've never had, oh...
And I've known you such a long, long time
We're almost family
Oh, that makes it just as difficult
As a feeling can be
Still I've made up my mind
That the very next time
You let your feelings for me show
I'm gonna let the world know, oh...

I hope the world don't mind our love
(I wanna be with you, baby)
But under the circumstances, yeah, yeah
I want to be with you so much
'Til I'm gonna take my chances
Take my chances, baby

I hope the world don't mind our love
But under the circumstances
I want to be with you so much
I'm gonna take my chances
Take my chances, baby...

// Girl I'm Standing There //

Girl, I'm standing there beside you
This is a decision of my own
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never stand alone

I wanna make love to you
Want to make wild and tender, sweet, sweet love
But whether or not we do
I will never desert or let anything hurt you, ooh...

Girl, I'm standing there beside you
This is a decision of my own
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never stand alone

Some people just love like me
And then hope that they're not being used
Look at me and who do you see
A friend or a tool, a man or a fool, ooh...

Even if you go away
My love will remain
Somewhere deep inside of me
Unpretending, never, never ending

Girl, I'm standing there beside you
If you ever need a helping hand
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never have to stand alone
As long as there is me

// Driving Thru Life In The Fast Lane //

I'd like to slow down long enough
To call the girl I'm dreaming of
But too much highway's stretching out ahead
'Cause like the wind that's blowing free
There's something wild inside of me
That keeps me moving down the road instead

And I'm driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast lane

It get hard to read the signs
Or count the little yellow lines
That flash by like her picture in my mind
I've said so many sad goodbyes
I've quit asking myself why
Or if what's up ahead's as good
As what I've left behind

And I'm driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast lane

I'm driving, driving

Yeah, I'm driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And there's answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast

Driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast

Driving through life in the fast lane...
