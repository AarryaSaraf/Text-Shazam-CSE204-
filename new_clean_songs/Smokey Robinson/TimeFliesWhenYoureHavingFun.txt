Album: TimeFliesWhenYoureHavingFun

// Time Flies //

Break of day
Why you coming so fast
Go away
I don't want to have to leave her yet

Here we lay 
And we want it to last
We'll take every extra second we can get

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun

Father time

Won't you slow down tonight
Mother Nature
Is taking her course

You know I'm feeling more than alright
And my lovin' baby
You're the loving source

Have you ever been involved
Doing something
And you don't want it to stop
You hope it's never done

Like the old saying goes
Everybody knows
Time flies when you're having fun

// Don't Know Why //

I waited 'til I saw the sun
Don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind forever

I would cross the angry sea
Die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
Don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
Don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

// You're The One For Me //

The first time I laid eyes on you
I had an instant suspicion
To be with you would become
My life's ambition

I knew right away, form the very first day
That somewhere down the line
I'd wake up to see you lying right next to me
You'd be mine, all mine, all mine

You're the one for me, baby
Yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Opportunity comes knocking
In the form of somebody new
But I don't answer
'Cause the door to my heart is only open to you

Temptation around
Staring me down
Right in my face
But nobody could ever take your place
No one could fill your space

You're the one for me, baby
Yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Nobody could ever make feel good
Like you do
Nobody, but nobody, could ever thrill me so
I've got my mind made up about you
And I know, I know, it's you, it's you

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, you're the one
Oh yeah, you're the one, now
Anyone can see, baby
You're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Baby, you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yes, mm-mm

// One Time //

No sooner had you come into my sight
When I thought I had been struck by
A bolt of lightning
It wasn't in the forecast, from the weatherman
I told myself, you got to get yourself together, man
What a vibration to my brain it was
The thought to be with you was instantaneous
Something 'bout you woman
TheÂ [?] you call it
If what I see is what I get
I'd like to touch it all
One time, baby
Could be the start of from now on

I don't know how you
Do what you do to me
But I know the feeling
Is getting through to me

The feeling that I have
Become a slave to
When I'm with you or without you
I still crave you

I hope that in the very near future you'll
Tell me that the feeling is mutual
I want you baby so much
Get you by yourself
Touch to touch

One time, baby
Could be the start of from now on

We could be good
We could be the best
It's about time
Ee put it to the test

My only request is
One time, one time, one time

And maybe then we could make it happen
Again and again, again and again
Again and again, again and again

Told myself, I think she needs some lovin'
I'd like to give her it
Gonna do my best to deliver it

Said I'd like to love you
Like you'd like it
You heart's desire
Love you so right 'til
You never tire
And on and on at night now
All the time

Keep it up
Keep it real
Keep me on your mind

One time, baby
One time, baby

You could never be a 'B' call
If it's up to me
You're a recall

Over and over and over again
Over and over and over

Again and again

One time, baby

// That Place //

That place, deep inside of you
That special place, you give me

That you say is mine exclusively
What you say is my private domain
You've made that so plain
That place deep inside of you
Where no other one is allowed

'Cause it's mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Makes me feel so proud
What you say is my territory
Is there just for me

Ooh, it's my paradise
Oh, it's my comfort zone
Ooh, it's so very nice
Knowing there's a part of you
That's mine alone

There's no place like that place
Deep inside of you
That's always ready for me
That's so full of love
And you let it flow free
It comes flowing down
Like warm summer rain

Before the feeling's over
Here it comes again
Before the feeleing's over
Here it comes again

There's no place like that place
No place like that place
No place

Wanna tell you that
There's no place like that place
No, no, no, no place
No place like that place
Deep inside of you

// Love Bath //

Let's Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Let's take a love bath baby

Put some water in the tub and do the body rub
Touchin...
Close as can be, I'm touchin you... you're touchin me

Lets take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Lets take a love bath baby

Hot! As a love can be
We got! all the time we need
I- E, don't want to end this night
Soft candlelight, everythings right

Lets take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby

Lets take a love bath baby

[Instrumental]

You, what a wonderful sight
All wet glowin' in the candlelight
I want to stay here forever
I want to see, if you can take all of me

Let's take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Lets take a love bath baby

[repeat in signature falsetto end fade]

// Whatcha Gonna Do //

Whatcha gonna do
With those beautiful fingers
When you stroke me like that
I get a thrill that lingers
Even after you take
Your hands away

The feel of your touch
Seems to stay and stay
Feels like the touch of love to me, baby
The look in your eyes
Makes me wonder what you have in mind

I'm really anxious to find out
Whatcha gonna do to me with you

Whatcha gonna do
With those beautiful lips
Just watching you talk sometimes
Sends me on trips

I'm looking right at you
But I don't hear what your saying
'Cause I'm mesmerized by your beautiful mouth
And my mind is straying

Sounds like you're talking love
To me baby
No matter what you might be talking about

I can't wait to find out
Whatcha gonna do to me with you

All you need is what you got
And you got so many assets
That make my blood run hot
To me, you're as good as it gets

Hey, hey, baby, baby

Whatcha gonna do
With a body so fine
Will you hold it against me
If I say I want you for mine

Feels like you wanna be with me, baby
Got me anticipating and waiting for what's in store
Don't make me wait anymore

Do what you wanna
Do what you feel
Do anything, baby
As long as it's real

Do it now, baby
Do it now, baby
Whatcha gonna do to me with you
Do it, baby, do it, baby
Please do it
Please do it to me
Come on, baby
Do it

// Satisfy You //

I would
If I could
Find a hundred other undiscovered ways
To satisfy you

Everyday
Right away
When I wake up
I make up my mind
To satisfy you

In my Head
In my Bed
I'm the only person
Who knows just what to do
To satisfy you

Your satisfaction and what you need
Is important to me
I'm doing my best
To plant a seed

So love can grow
And you can know
In your Mind in your Body
In your Heart and Soul
In life my road
My Aim my Goal
Is to satisfy you

Get timing now
Play
Yeah

Your satisfaction and what you need
Is important to me
I'm doing my best
To plant a seed

So love can grow
And you can know
In your Mind in your Body
In your Heart and Soul
In life my road
My Aim my Goal
Is to satisfy you

// You're Just My Life //

Not so important
In the big picture
That the rest of the world
Waits to see
What you're daily decisions
Are gonna be
What you do or don't do
Won't set all the captives free
If you're asking me
You're just my life, that's all

Not a big river
Making your way to the ocean
Carrying dreams as you flow
Don't matter much where you go
What you do or don't do
Won't make all the flowers grow
Oh, if you really wanna know
You're just my life, that's all

You're just my life, that's all
Paparazzi may not consider you
To be someone who's worthy
To be newsworthy

But you're my life
You're my all
You're my winter, summer, spring, and fall
You're my everything
My diamond in the rough
All of the things I could say
Are not enough

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

The world may not even recognize your name
You may not have fortune and fame
The world may not even recognize your face
But I believe, because of you
It's a better place

You're the wonder in what's wonderful to me
You're living proof that a loving truth was meant to be
Every day I pray, I say, "I hope you stay"
Cause you're my life

// I Want You Back //

When I had you to myself
I didn't even want you 'round
But those pretty faces always make you 
Stand out in a crowd
Somebody picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
And now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

Oh

Ooh

Trying to live without your love 
Brought on sleepless nights
Let me show you, woman
That I know wrong from right

Every street you walk on 
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the woman
I didn't even want around 

Oh baby, give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me 
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go 
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back 
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

Oh

Oh, oh

Oh baby, give one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
And now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back
Since I see you in his arms
You know I want you back

I want you back 
I, I, I, I gotta have you back
I gotta have your lovin'
I gotta have your lovin'
I, I, I, want you back, baby 
I want you back, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please come on back 
Please come on back 
Please come on back 
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please come on back 
...
