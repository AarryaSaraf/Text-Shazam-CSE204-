// Jesus Told Me To Love You //

You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you
No matter how you try me [?] you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you

The lamb who is our shepard too has proven his love for you
Come on now, take your place in his meadowland of grace
Where I know you'll surely find comfortness and peace of mind
If we just accept His love
He'll never disown us and eternal life is a bonus

You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you (well now)
No matter how you try me [?] you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you

Take that hate away from here
Let's create a new atmosphere
Where we recognize the fact
That hate can only hold us back
If we do what Jesus said
Give each other love instead
This could be a better place
For us to raise our children
We just have to do His will here

You can't be my enemy because Jesus told me to love you (well now)
No matter how you try me [?] you're gonna be loved by me
Because Jesus told me to love you
(Well now) No matter how you try me
You're gonna be loved by me
(Because Jesus) because Jesus told me to love you (oh)

Well, I'll just have to pray for you rather than to hold a grudge
I am but the witness God will be the judge
You can't be my enemy (my enemy) because Jesus told me to love you (told me to love you)
I have no choice since I heard His voice
Jesus told me I've got to love you (I've got to love you)
(Well now) (You can't be) You can't be (my enemy) (no no no no)
(Jesus told me) Jesus told me to love you
You know that I (I have no choice) have no choice (since I heard His voice) (ooh)
Since I heard His voice (Jesus) Jesus (told me) told me to love
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
Jesus told me told me to love you
(Jesus told me told me to love you)
(Told me) I got to love you
Jesus told me to love you

// Standing On Jesus //

You're all mixed up
You don't know what to do
You talk a lot of stuff
But it's all half true
You know you better get yourself together
Cause your standing on shaky ground
But the lies you've been living can all be forgiven
When you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus

(Well)
You're walking tall
Got your feeble strut
You suddenly fall
From you don't know what
Who, you wonder, pulled the rug out from under
Somebody cool as you
But there's no doubt about it, grounds never solid
Till you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus

(Ooh, yes)

Our father built termination
On a rock foundation
He said my son is the one to do what needs to be done
To help you out in any situation

Well you just can't see
To stay on track
You take two steps left
And three steps back
You're so unstable cause your just unable
To get a good hold on life
You don't know how good it is to be so good
Until you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus
You don't know how good it is to be so good
Until you're standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on
Standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on
Standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus
Standing on Jesus, standing on god (ooh)
Standing on the Lord (ooh)
Standing on Jesus, standing on Jesus
Standing on the Lord
Standing on the Lord (ooh)
Standing on Jesus
Standing on, standing on, standing on Jesus

// I Have Prayed On It //

Been having problems with my woman
Been walking the floor
Can't sleep at night
But I know now if we make up
Even if we break up
For me every things gonna be alright

Cause I have prayed on it [?]
I have turned it over to the only one
Who can solve any problem
I say Father, oh Father, let your will be done

Child is doing drugs and hanging with the wrong crowd
Stead of getting better seems to be getting worse
Did every thing I could but it didn't do no good
So now I've done what I should done first
I got down on my knees and said, help me please

And I prayed on it (I have prayed on it) prayed on it, prayed on it
I have turned it over (I have prayed on it) to the only one
(I have prayed on it) who can solve any problem
And said Father, oh Father, Father, let your will be done

Father, let your will be done (Father let your will be done) in my life

Trouble on your job your boss is so demanding
Your money getting funny and your bills overdue
Your whole life situation is just trial and tribulation
I know one thing that will see you through (ah)
Just go to the place where you fall on your face and you (Have you prayed on it) pray on it
You got to (Have you prayed on it) tell your problem to the only one who can solve any problem
(Have you prayed on it) Father let your will be done
Oh have you prayed on it (Have you prayed on it)
Pray on it, pray on it, pray on it, pray on it, pray on it (Have you prayed on it) (Ah)
Have you gone to the place where you fall on your face and you've prayed on it (Have you prayed on it)
Have you got on your knees and said Father please prayed on it (Ah oh)
(Have you prayed on it) Have you grabbed Jesus' train
Have you grabbed Jesus' train (Have you) (Ah oh) (prayed on it)
Have you prayed on it

// Gang Bangin //

Wasting your time
Drinking that wine
Smoking that smoke
Doing that coke
Dealing that dope
Giving up hope
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

Staying out late
Preaching that hate
Defying your mother
Killing your brother
Killing in waves
Filling up graves
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin (oh yeah)

(You know that)
Widows are crying
Babies are dying
A child at play
Got in the way
Innocent children
Somebody killed them
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

Whatcha thinking now, whatcha doing
Just how many lives do you have to ruin
Gang bangin (owe) (break it down)

I betcha you don't even know how it started
How you came to be in this position
Hate was handed down by somebody
It's just the neighborhood no good hand me down been around tradition
A neighborhood no good hand me down been around tradition
Your killing each other for tradition, tradition

Sometimes I think that you would if you could (uh-huh) and that would be good (uh-huh)
But homie won't let you (uh-huh) for he's gonna get you (uh-huh)
But maybe if you stop (uh-huh) it might make a few stop
Gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin

I heard that somebody said (uh-huh) god is dead (uh-huh)
Leaving you free to (uh-huh) continue to be you (uh-huh)
But I guarantee you (uh-huh) god can see you (uh-huh)
I guarantee you (uh-huh) god can see you
This gang bangin, gang bangin, gang bangin
Gang bangin now, gang bangin, gang bangin
Gang bangin (yeah), gang bangin now

Love thy neighbor as thy self
Put those weapons on the shelf
Use your life for something else positive
You know that gang bangin ain't no way to live
(Ooh) (gang bangin) gang bangin (now) gang bangin
Gang banging now (yeah) (alright) (yeah, yeah) (gang bangin) gang bangin (now)
