// Gasms //

Eyegasms
When I look at you, it makes me feel better than good
And what I see is you and me together forever
I'm knocking on wood
Every kind of gasm in the book
Each I has 'em everytime I take a look

Eargasms
When I hear your voice my eardrums start to quiver
It's a sexy sound makes my love come down
And I know, you can deliver
Any kind of gasm on the list
The gasms you don't give me I don't think exists

You give me gasms

Soft and sweet or the kind the neighbors heargasms
If I think about you right now gon give me gasms (Gasms gasms)
Every little thought somehow gon give me gasms (Gasms gasms)
You get those mindgasms, those hard to find gasms

Just thinking about you or when you're here gasms
Every kind of gasm ever known
And a few I think are only mine alone

// How You Make Me Feel //

When you get that look on
I could write a book on
All the ways I'm hooked on

How you make me feel
How you make me feel

Got my motor running
One touch and I'm done in
So much sexy fun in

How you make me feel
How you make Me feel

You make me feel like everything's okay everyday
You make me feel like everything's alright every night
I'm addicted to you
Nothing about me is restricted to you
I can't wait to see what you're fixing to do

Cause I know
Whatever it is
Is gonna feel better
Said I know
Whatever it is
Is gonna feel better
Better better better better

Ooh
You make me feel like everything's okay everyday
Don'tcha know you make me
Feel like everything's alright every night
How you make me feel
Y'all break it down a little bit

You make me feel like everything's okay everyday
Yes
You make me feel like everything's alright every night
Okay everyday
Alright every night

It's gonna be
Okay everyday

Alright every night

Feelin' good right now

You make me feel like everything's alright every night
Feel like I wanna be with you baby
I wanna be with you right now

How you make me feel
Ooh baby
Feels so good
Feels so good
Don't stop
It feels real good baby

How you make me feel
How you make me feel

// I Wanna Know Your Body //

I wanna know your body like it was my own
All night, is that alright?
I wanna know your body like it was my own
Every part, a beautiful sight
I wanna sing about it in a sweet love song
Clever words I wanna write
I wanna make the music all night long
While I'm holdin' you tight

What would be my dream come true
Is for me to be with you
All the things that we could do
Yeah, to make each other feel good

I wanna know your body like it was my own
If it's not asking too much
Well I wanna have your body answer like a telephone
In response to my touch
I wanna touch your body with passion
Every curve, every line
And I wanna make your body glow from head to toe
Light it up like a neon sign

Every time you walk my way
I know what I wanna do
Even if I don't know what to say
I'm thinkin', maybe one day
Ooh, we'll make each other feel good (feel good)

Ooh

Every time you walk my way
I know what I wanna do
Even if I don't know what to say
I'm thinkin' maybe one day
Ooh, we'll make each other feel good (feel good)

I wanna know your body like it was my own
If that's alright
Maybe one day, I might

// I Keep Callin' You //

I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you all the time

Here they go again
Thoughts of you and me
Lovin' there and then
Wherever we might be
Simple things like touching in public
Private touches goin' unseen
A look that says what goes without sayin'
But I know what you mean
You know what I mean

I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you all the time

Here I go again
Dreaming while awake
My mind is racing like the wind
I can't put on the brake
The signal says "proceed with all caution"
Get out and run right through
'Cause I can't wait to get to that feelin'
I only know when I'm with you

Oh, I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
Calling you all the time

(Come on baby keep it comin')
(Come on baby keep it comin')

I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
Calling you all the time

(Come on baby keep it comin')
(Come on baby keep it comin')

I keep calling you baby
Calling you baby
Calling you baby
Calling your name

// Roll Around //

Everyday I can't wait till the time rolls around where I can be with you

Whenever my day seem hard and totally wack
When I feel like I've put out and got nothin' back
I can't wait to get back to my sugar-shack
Where I know you'll lay me down

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around

When I wanna go someplace cool that's really warm
When extraordinary lovin' is the norm
Where we create our own quiet storm
There's thunder and lighting when we get unwound

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around
However I feel at end of day
However the world is treating me
However I know I'll be okay
'Cause you'll be there lying next to me
We're each other's ecstasy

Ooh, ah, ah

Maybe we'll take a walk for watch tv
Or maybe we'll just talk about you and me
Whatever we choose to do, we'll be totally free
Even if we go out, and paint the town

I can't wait for our time to roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around
Roll around, roll around, roll around

// Beside You //

Beside you
That's where I want to be forever
I'm like a soul lost in the river
Searching for a helping hand
Ooh
I love you (yes I love you)
I guess my dear that's why I need you
Please don't leave me bewildered, sad, and blue
Make all my dreams come true

Each night as I lay sleeping
I see no one but you
Oh, I know, if I should bore you
You'd find somebody new

I'd wish you joy
But if you found your new love made you sad and blue
Always remember there's a place in my heart
Place in my heart for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Beside you, that's where I wanna be forever
I don't ever wanna make you sad or unhappy
I don't wanna make you feel bad
I don't wanna make you uncomfortable
I'll always wanna be beside you

Ooh
Beside you
Yes beside you
I wanna be with you forever
Yes I love you
Love you
Beside you is where I wanna be
Yes, beside you

// If We Don't Have Each Other //

Wake up in the mornin'
And there's love layin' there
Take up where we left off
Feel like stayin' there

Can't imagine ever bein' without you
You know you got everything I think I'll ever need
I love every little thing about you, baby

Tell me, what do we have
If we don't have each other?
We don't have anything
If we don't have each other
Tell me, tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
Not nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all (We don't have anything)
Without each other (If we don't have each other)

I love it when we snuggle
When you're holdin' onto me
We're like two pieces of a puzzle
We fit together perfectly
We come to a meeting
Yeah, at the perfect junction
So close, so tight
We need each other to full function
Ooh, baby, baby

We got you, we got me
We got us, we got we
We got love to make
We got love to make

Tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
Nothin' at all, nothin' at all (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all (We don't have anything)
(If we don't have each other)
Tell me, tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
A bunch of nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
Without each other, we got nothin', baby (We don't have anything)
(If we don't have each other)

Without you, I'm not whole
You're my heart, you're my soul
You're my soulmate
You're my soulmate
Ooh, ooh

Nobody has ever made me feel
Like you do, hey
I love it when you say I make you feel
That same way too
Ooh

Tell me (Tell me, what do we have)
We got nothin', baby, nothin' (If we don't have each other?)
We don't have anything at all, baby (We don't have anything)
Without each other (If we don't have each other)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby (Tell me, what do we have)
Oh, baby (If we don't have each other?)
Nothin', nothin', nothin' (We don't have anything)
Don't you agree? (If we don't have each other)

// You Fill Me Up //

You fill me up all the time
You make my days so much brighter
You fill me up all the way
You make my load so much lighter

Oh and I
I'm so thankful to be loved by
Loved by somebody like you

You fill me up deep down inside
Way way way down you light that flame
You fill me up with a burnin' passion
All you have to do is say my name

Oh and I hope I can be
Whoever it is
Whoever it is you need in me

You fill me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh my cup of you is overflowing
Yes, and loving you like I do
I tell myself, it's not just for sayin'
You gotta be showin'
Show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it

You fill me up
You fill me up

// I Fit In There //

Let me in your life
Make some room for me
If deep down inside, you're hoping
To fill up an opening

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

If empty fills up your private place
And nothing and no one can penetrate
If you got an inner vacancy
Baby, then make it a place for me

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

Oh baby, now
I'm watching and waiting and
Anticipating and
First opening
I'm gonna strike
If you don't wanna be in love
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?

If you got one whole hour
One whole day, if you got one whole life
I don't have a crystal ball, I can't do future reads
But I know when it comes to all
Your future needs

I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there
I fit in there

Open up, let me in
Let's let you and me begin
I fit in there
I fit in there

Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now

Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?
Can we be in heavy like?

Oh baby, now
Oh baby, now
Oh baby
