// Can't Stop //

There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes, I try to, to disappear
I look around in my own way
But what I see I never, never really know
I wander 'round until I feel it coming on and then it's
It's time to go
I don't want to be here, falling out of place
Confusion's the consensus, fighting for my space

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me

I lived it, I live it, it's not easy to say
I felt it, I feel it, it's just another day
It scares me, why does it dare me
You know it aint a fair fight
Pain overtakes me, it tries to break me
You know that something aint right

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

They don't make no seatbelt for the mind.
So I can't fasten up for this ride...

Running away, can't stop the runaway emotions
Not right, can't fight
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Fighting, hiding, can't stop the runaway emotions
Hypnotized, paralyzed
Can't stop the runaway emotions

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions

I hate it, I hate me, like my consistency
I've seen it, I see it, I'm talking literally
So much lying, too much denying
It's time to face the facts
You can't help me
These cards were dealt me
Play out the final act

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
You got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

Oh no, you really done it this time

Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions

There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes but I can't, can't disappear

// Accept My Sacrifice //

No destination set
I daze along till something finds me
Where I've been I'm not sure
I cannot see the tears, they blind me

You know that something ain't right
It's a sacrifice
Why must I pay this price
Accept my sacrifice

An emptiness so full
I cap it off with expectations
A sight not to behold
I cover all in explanations

It's a sacrifice
No no no no no
It's a sacrifice a sacrifice

Sailing off of course, directions lost
There is no exit
The captain's abandoned ship, now mutiny
How could I suspect this

It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, accept my sacrifice
It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice
Accept my sacrifice

// Tap Into The Power //

I've seen pain that'll drive a man further
Than any road could ever take you

Stare at the wall, it doesn't move, must think it's bad
But I'll prove who is harder
It makes no sense, at least to you
But who's to say, I refuse
Refuse to be a martyr

Welcome in the pain
It's a glorious hour
Say hello to the hate
Tap into the...

I come and go your eyes can't tell
'Cause all they see is that I'm
I'm still standing here
What's that you sense, it can't be good
You're scared to look, but I ask
What's worse than fear?

Welcome in the pain
It's a glorious hour
Say hello to the hate
Tap into the...
Don't be afraid, don't run away
Tap into the power
I want it all, I want it all
Tap into the power

What you were told, it's all a lie
Don't be afraid because
Now's the time to explore it
Drop all the fear, try to deny
But it won't work
No longer can you ignore it

Welcome in the pain
It's a glorious hour
Say hello to the hate
Tap into the power!

// Monopoly On Sorrow //

There's a cold wind in the winter of my mind
A season that last through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tomorrow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think what will bring tomorrow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
You know plenty has made it my way
You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow
There's plenty that feel just the same

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
Hurts, hurts
And I know that I know I don't know that I know
It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go
I just wanna know why it's me
Ain't got a monopoly on sorrow

You, you, you ain't got no no, you ain't got no no
You ain't got no no, you ain't got no no
There's no monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow no no no

You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no
You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no
No monopoly on sorrow
Monopoly on sorrow
Monopoly on sorrow
No no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no monopoly on sorrow

// We Call This Mutha Revenge //

Is this the beginning or the end

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

Best not be talking to me, not with those words you said
I guess I'll have to accept your invitation
To toast you upside your head
Everything has got a start
And everything has got an end
And every action has a side effect
We call this mutha revenge

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

Don't know if I'll blast, maybe I'll just throw
Maybe I'll kick down something special
But believe me, you're gonna know
Should have thought before you got it started
'Cause everything has got an end
Ain't no sloppy fool that's innocent
We call this mutha revenge
Revenge, revenge
This is the beginning of the end

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

I've seen loc'sters come, I've seen loc'sters go
But the only real loc'sters
Are holding down six feet below
Everything has got a start
And everything has got an end
Every action has a side effect
We call this mutha revenge

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

You're putting up a front, we're gonna tear it down
Had enough of your sorry ass 'tude
I don't trip no stare me down
You should of thought before you got it started

'Cause we're the ones that make it end
Ain't no sloppy fool that's innocent
We call this mutha revenge

Revenge, revenge
Revenge, revenge

// I Wasn't Ment To Feel This Way/Asleep At The Wheel //

Counting on nothing,the numbers get higher
Blinded by reason, you're asleep at the wheel
Confused understanding, with a slip for the hold
Squeeze past the pressure, you're asleep at the wheel

A magical moment
Is it too much of a good thing
Recycled in memory was
It too much of a good thing
Why can't you remember
Is it too much of a good thing
Preserved in it's danger
You're asleep at the wheel
Blank stare and a whisper, but who are you judging
I thought you were different
You're asleep at the wheel

A special assignment
Is it too much of a good thing
Unlocked underpressure
Was it too much of a good thing
Confined unforgiveness
Is it too much of a good thing
A new kind of danger, you're asleep at the wheel

Hope in revision, slight miscalculation
It all goes in stages, you're asleep at the wheel

A blank stare and a whisper
I thought you were different
But who are you judging
I thought you were different
You're asleep at the wheel

// I'll Hate You Better //

In this world without harmony
Where there's no peace and there's no sanity
I can still survive and survive peacefully
Until that moment when you crash down on me

Cause I'll
I'll hate you better
Cause I'll
I'll hate you better

You better watch how you direct your hate
Or you'll receive part of my natural trait
Before you send off, you just better wait
Cause I aint got time not to retaliate

I'll, I'll hate you better
I'll hate you better

I'm not trying to threaten or to decieve
I'm just enlightening you so you wont be niave
I'll tell you one thing that you better believe
My hate is better to give than to receive

I'll, I'll hate you better
I'll

// Wich Way To Free? //

Free--can anyone show me the way to free?
Free--does anyone know which way is to free?

I aint here to dought you, just heard so much about you
Wont you save a place for me
I hope you'll let me choose you
I never would abuse you
Please accept my sincerity

Free--I want you
Free--I need you
Free--which way's it to free?
Free--I want to hold you
Free--I want to know you
Free--Can you send me to free

Although some may deny you
I'd really love to try you
I need this opportunity
My past has been divided
My future, I'll rewrite it
Change my life if it need to be

Which way's it to free?
Which way's it to free?

Free--Can anyone show me the way to free?
Free--Does anyone know which way is to free?

Gimme some free...Which way's it to
Gimme some free...Which way's it to

// It's Going Down //

It's going down in my dark side
My mind starts sweating, my heart
It starts a chain reaction
That's how the pain it all starts

It's going down where no one can see
It's a sad sad sight
The feeling just gets stronger
I see you, I just put on a smile
I try to cover it up
But I can't take it too much longer

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't cause I'm not dreaming

It's going down in my dark side
With no release or escape
Doesn't believe in forgiveness
It's an emotional rape

It's going down where no one can see
It's a sad sad sight
No suspense as what will follow
Fractured terror fills my peace
Shocks my senses
Leave me empty sad and hollow

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't cause I'm not dreaming

It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin'
It's goin' down

It's going down in my dark side
Shivers and shakes through my soul
Ration surveys the damage
There's nothing left to control

It's going down now, I'm face to face
With the hollowness
That echoes in this darkness
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight
Reluctantly how can I even stop this
All hell is breaking loose
Now panic rules as emotions blaze on fire

I'm goin' down down down down down
I'm goin' down
I'm so damn tired

It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin' down
It's goin' down it's goin'
It's goin' down

It's goin' down in my darkside

// Where's The Truth //

Late at night, that's the time I can't forget it
Sail the darkness but this ain't sleep
Heard the sound, could it be I got the message
But the message wasn't intended for me
Can't you see there's a madman working
He's putting in overtime
Too content with the sweet scent of denial
You're oblivious to the signs

It's a struggle for the reason
But it's the only thing I know

No surprise, here's more lies and you still are wailing
What the hell are you saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying
Truth abuse, what's the use, it's not a game you're playing
Do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth

I'm not you, you're not me, that's the difference
So you can't deny we're the same
What's the point, that's what sticks huh exactly
Take a second helping of the blame
Not a scare not a bomb not a warning
A condition that no one should doubt
There's a tick tock tick tock
Ticking in my head you gotta get out

Yet I cannot deny the reason
'Cause it's the only thing I know

No remorse, danger course, and you still are wailing
You don't know what you're saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying
Sick in thought, disease you've caught
Is it a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth

It's a struggle for the reason
But it's the only thing I know

Too much tweak, dosage leak
And you still are wailing, what the hell are you saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why are you lying

Set to lose, why you choose
It's not a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth

Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth
You're lying!
