// No Reason To Quit //

There's a circle of people where I'm no longer welcome
I'm ashamed to say that I'm no longer fit
I could sober up tomorrow and face my friends again
But I've got no reason to quit
No I've got no reason for living right and there's no other way to forget
I could sober up tomorrow and face my friends again
But I've got no reason to quit

I've got no reason for living right and there's no other way to forget
I know down deep inside me I'm man enough to change
But I've got no reason to quit
