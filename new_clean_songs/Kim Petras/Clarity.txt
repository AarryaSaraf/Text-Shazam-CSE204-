Album: Clarity

// Clarity //

Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Give a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit, you a parody
Clarity, I got clarity
VVS's 'round my neck, now they stare at me
Ain't no wonder why they all so scared of me
I'm a rarity, I got clarity

I know what I want
And I'ma go and get it, yeah
I'm a number one, yeah
I know you won't forget it
Keep my eyes on the prize, no surprise that I'm lit
Got one hand on the blunt, other hand on the whip
I be cruisin', you be snoozin'
That's why you losin', I'm oozin'
Confidence is boomin', boomin'

Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Give a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit

I ain't worried 'bout nada
'Less it Gucci, 'less it Prada
'Less it Dolce or Gabbana
'Less a trip to the Bahamas
I wanna feel like Madonna
I wanna feel like I'm way up
Crew ain't pullin' up until you pay us
Made another hit, no lay-up
Stay lit every single day I wake up

Clarity, I got clarity
I'm the bitch with the sauce, apparently
Give a few of y'all drip, that's charity
I ain't worried 'bout shit, you a parody
Clarity, I got clarity
VVS's 'round my neck, now they stare at me
Ain't no wonder why they all so scared of me
I'm a rarity, I got clarity

Woo-ah!

// Icy //

Never loved nobody harder
Never, ever felt stronger
Thought that we would last forever

Gave me something to believe in
Thought that you were all I needed
Look at me, I'm still breathing

I used to cry over you, baby
I've wasted all this time

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

Now I'm on a higher level
I ain't ever gonna settle
Plenty offers on the table

Baby I don't even hate ya
Really you did me a favor
Turned my heart into a glacier, yeah

I used to cry over you, baby
I've wasted all this time

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

(Yeah)

Now I got a ice-cold heart
VVS's's the only kinda ice I want
Kinda funny how the money can't replace the love
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy

'Cause of you now my heart is so icy
So numb, I don't feel it inside me
So dumb, I believed you really liked me
'Cause of you now my heart is so icy
Icy

Break me, break me out of myself (Yeah, yeah)
Touch me, only your hands make me come alive
Save me from my personal Hell (Yeah, yeah)

Family says that I need help

Exorcise my demons, yeah
Tender love could get me there

// Broken //

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

You cut me open, I cried oceans
All I wanted was devotion
Now I got nothing
Hope you happy with your new bitch
How you livin'?
I'm in Paris in my Jacob's, life's amazing
When she leave you for your best friend
That shit karma
When you see me with my new dude
That's a come up
Yeah, you used to have the baddest, lookin' lavish
Dipped in carats
Only want me back when you can't have me

I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

You don't even know what you did to me
Tears fall like rain, man
You were my all baby, literally
I just can't take it
Couldn't eat, sleep for days
And my mind going four ways
Bottle of Jack half-empty
In and out of bed, sitting in the hallway
You don't know the tears that I cried
You don't want to see my dark side
And my mind going psycho
Hate or love for you, is it my time
Friends thought I was insane
Almost took your name
I just gotta do to you what you did to me
At night when I pray

I used to do it all for you
I used to give it all to you

You made it hurt too much
Hope you got, hope you got
Everything you want
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

So much for the love
Hope she got, hope she got
Everything I'm not
Pray to God, pray to God
That she leave you broken, broken (Hearted)
Like you left me broken, broken (Hearted)

Every day I hope you're broken hearted
Every night I hope you're broken hearted
Every day I hope you're broken hearted
Yeah, broken hearted

(Hearted)
(Hearted)
(Hearted)

// All I Do Is Cry //

I need you more than I
I see you everywhere
Nobody else compares
I don't go anywhere

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

Wish I could forget you, like I never met you
Said you want break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

All I do is cry about you
All I do is cry-
You're always in my head
Feels like I'm living dead
Remember when you said that this would never end?

Before I close my eyes
I think of all the lies
Can't go to sleep at night
I've tried a million times

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
Thought that you were the exception
Took a fatal blow to my heart
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you
(All I do is cry about you)

Wish I could forget you, like I never met you
Said you want break, then you broke my heart
You left me with nothing, I feel like I'm drowning
You just let me down and I don't know why
Wish that I could say that you're dead to me
What's it gonna take to feel alive again?
I feel like I'm breaking, I keep medicating
I just can't believe that it's over now

All I do is cry about you
I don't wanna die without you
I just want for you to need me
You're just gonna keep me bleeding
I don't wanna die without you
All I do is cry about you

// Do Me //

Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad
Give it to me, to me like that
Feels so good, got me coming right back

Touch me, touch me there, right there
Kiss it, lick it, flip it
Leave your handprints on my ass, yeah
Won't get to the bed, to the bed
Counter, in the kitchen
Bathroom mirror's on the stairs, yeah

I love when you love me back to back
Baby, be my QB while I'm throwing it back
Swear you're no good for me, that's a fact
Don't need to talk about it, save your breath

Do me, do me, do me like that
Hurt me so good, make me wanna be bad

Neighbours gotta know, how we go
Couple on it, rounds, lock it down to the flow now
Had me hitting notes, high notes
Seven to eleven, boy, you do me straight to heaven now

And I love when you make me come back to back
And my legs are shaking, nobody does it like that
Swear you know my body, you don't need a map
Just give it to me harder, I can take it, yeah!

From haters to lovers
From nada to Prada, you know you're a star
You are shinin', lit as a diamond
From dollar to bottle
You know you're a star, you are

Sometimes, sometimes
You gotta jump through fences with a barbed wire
You wanna wave the white flag for the hard times
You're just a little unprepared for the long ride
But that's fine, that's fine
Smoke Bob Marley, everything gon be alright
Roll it side to side, time and there's no lie
Shinin' so bright even at night

If you're lost in the down, don't give up now
You should know just what you are

From the bottom you come up

If they follow, they'll just meet you at the finish line
You don't need no parachute if know how to fly, unless you fly
We're out of line (Out of line)
When I was in the club, you was on your grind (On your grind)
Your victory is so sweet, they are so alive (So alive)
You're killing it so hard, it should be a crime, should be a crime

If you're lost in the down, don't give up now
You should know just what you are

From the bottom you come up
From haters to lovers
From nada to Prada, you know you're a star
