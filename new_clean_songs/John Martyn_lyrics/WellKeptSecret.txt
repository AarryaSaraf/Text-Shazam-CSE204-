// Could've Been Me //

See that man with that look in his eye
I see him walking with you back home
I recognise that look in his eye
I wish he'd leave you alone

Could've been me
Could've been me
Ah might have been me
Could've been me

See that man waving you goodbye
I see no tear in your eye for him
See that man with the secret kept
In his tear stained eye

Could've been me
It could've been me
Oh yeah, it might have been me
Oh could've been me

Could've been me
Could have been me
I know it might have been me
Oh yeah, could have been me

See that man with that gleam in his eye
I watch him follow you round and around
I knew the time when that gleam in his eye
Could've laid him in the ground

Could've been me
Ah yeah, might have been me
I know it could've been me
Oh yeah, could've been me

You know it could have been me
Oh yes, could've been me
It might have been me
Oh yes, could have been me

I can't tell you
I can't tell you
Oh, I'm too careful

Could've been me
Oh, could've been me
I know it might have been me
I know it could have been me

Could have been me

// You Might Need A Man //

I knew the day that I would stand by you and all your failings
Now I'm looking out for me
If you want to split then I won't tell a soul about you
Darling just you wait and you'll see

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

I never thought I'd see the day you'd ever try to leave me
Now you've packed your bags and you've gone
All the money in the world won't help you darling
Take a look and see what you've done

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

And though the craziness of city life surrounds you darling
Just because you follow every trend
Come the day you find yourself alone and feeling restless
That's the day you're going to need a friend

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

You might need a man, mmm
Ah let me be your man
You might need a man like me
I wanna be that man
You might need a man like me
Oh let me be your man

You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me
You might need a man
I might just be the man you need
You might need a man like me

// Hung Up //

No eavesdropping darling, I overheard
Put me down, in action and word
Taking me for granted, I finally knew
I called you last night, I could not get through

Just hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
I'm hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

I run a check on your behaviour, got to check the bar
Trying to forget what people tell me you are
All I want to remember, is the diamonds in your eyes
The same precious memories I've come to despise

I'm just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Mmm, hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Nothing lasts forever, I know, nothing at all
I know you won't answer me when I start calling
That busy line is just a weapon you use
Just an empty sign in the mind of the man you want to lose

I'm just hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

Hung up, hung up on you
Just hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you
Hung up, hung up on you

// Gun Money //

Give me a pound
I'll make you sound
Just like a Rolls Royce on a summer's day
Give me a dollar
Make you sound
Just like a very expensive car

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
In any case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
All my money's gone
Gun money
Every cent is done

Give me a dollar
I'll make you holler
Like a bag full of cats
Give me a dollar
I'll make you sound just like your belly's full of rats

A dead end case
A dead end face
That's what I am
Dead end case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
All my money's gone
Gun money
All my money's done

Give me a coin
I'll turn it each and every single day
Give me a coin
I'll never give myself away

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
Dead end case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
Cos all your money's done
Gun money
All your money's done

Give me a pound of flesh
I'll make you sound
Just like a Rolls Royce on a summer's day
Give me a dollar
Or I might just blow
Your head away

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
A dead end case
I'm a dead end face
I got no car

Gun money
All your money's done
Gun money
All your money's gone
Gun money
All your money's gone

Take me, I take, they need, I take
Gun money, gun money, gun money, gun money, gun money

Gun money, all your money's done, gun money
Ow gun money
Let me speak, gun money
Straightdown the barrel, gun money
Cash on the barrel, yeah gun money gun money
They leave you dead

Gun money all your money's gone
Keep taking it away
Just keep taking it away
Keep taking it away
Oh, just keep taking it away
Gun money, gun money gun money gun money gun money

// Never Let Me Go //

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
Oh darling, won't you hold me tight?
And never let me go

And dry those eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times, or more
We said we'd never part
But lately, I find
I'm a stranger in your heart

Ah, give me the right
In summer or in spring time
To tell the world that you were mine
And never let me go

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
Oh darling, please hold me tight
And never let me go

And never let me go
And never let me go

// Love Up //

Your baby can't see you now, she's busy
She recommends you go and see Sister Lizzy
Step around the corner
Up against the wall
See to your needs, no trouble at all

Keep a rocking though you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking though you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

She's got big girls, she's got small girls, she's got the street lights
She wants thin boys, they're just street toys that run all night
She's got a hot boy, he's all joy, he's alright

A little bit early or a little bit late
I can see by your eyes, you just can't wait
Stay here a minute, I'll be fast as I can
Just got to get rid of this crazy man

Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking till you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up
Oh, keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking till you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

I like big girls, I like small girls, I love the street lights
I hate thin boys, they're just street toys, they stay all night
Well I'm all boy, and I'm all joy and I'm alright

Every week on Sunday, you'll find me waiting
Hanging around the door and just a he hesitating
I know I'm not welcome, I can't go in
My daddy, he's a minister, he says it's a sin

Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking, keep a rocking till your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep a rocking though you're rocking to your ruin
Love up, love up

I like big girls, small girls, street lights
Thin boys, street toys, they get all night
Love up, love up
I got the, got the big girls, small girls
Thin boys, they're just street toys to me
Love up, love up

All boy, hot joy, all right, all night
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking till you don't know what you're doing
Keep on rocking, it's got to be your ruin
Love up, love up
Keep a rocking
Keep a rocking
Love up, love up

// Changes Her Mind //

The answer may be yesterday
May be yes, today
She may say no, tomorrow
She says she might find some way
She says no today
She may say yes, tomorrow

She just changes her mind like the wind
She thinks loving me is such a sin
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

Many times I said I'd change my way
If she would only stay, just make a stay with me
So many times I've begged her: please don't go
Ah darling, don't say no, please spend your days with me

She just changes her mind like the wind
She says sometime I'm out, when I know that I'm in
Ah I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

She says loving me is such a sin
Tell me sometime I'm out, when I know I'm in
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

The question must be in her mind
But I can't ever find a way to talk to that girl
I know my heart is on her line
I just spend my time with my head in a spiral

Just changes her mind like the wind
She said loving me is such a sin
I don't know where to begin any more
She just changes her mind like the wind

She keeps, she keeps on changing
She keeps on changing her mind
Keep changing her mind all the time

She keeps on, she keep
She keep on she keep changing her mind, changing her mind
She keep on changing, keep on changing
Keeps changing her mind changing her mind, changing her mind all the time
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to watch her changing her mind any more
She keep changing her mind, changing her mind
Keep on changing her mind
Changing her mind, she keep on changing her mind

She keep on she keep on changing her mind, changing her mind, changing her mind
She keep on changing her mind all the time
She keeps on changing, keep on changing, keep on changing

// Hiss On The Tape //

Hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's just a hiss on the tape
Her head's so dirty
She's a girl on the make
She could be fifteen or thirty
Got to give her a break
Her sensitivities glisten
She's had all she can take
Still the tape keeps hissing

You can ask her the question
Ah she'll tell you the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's a ball in the air
Emotional token
Just one of a pair
Til her bond gets broken
There's a point in the line
Her mind starts doubting
Just a dot on the card
All done bar the shouting

Ask her the question
She'll keep telling the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape
She's a hiss on the tape

Hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
Oh she's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss

There's a crack in her mind
There's a fault in her logic
She's fallen behind
She knows she just can't dodge it
Like the snap of the trap
She closes up so tightly
She cut out all the rap
She just plays twice nightly

Ask her the question
She'll keep telling the lie
They're too many to mention
Too many wondering why

Oh She's going out with a friend
She's in a strange good humour
She got no time to spend
She's just the start of the rumour
Just a silky suggestion
A sliver of thigh
It's out of the question
Give the slightest of sighs

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a girl on the make
She's just a hiss on the tape

She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss
She's just a hiss on the tape
She's just a hiss

// Back With A Vengeance //

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

It's just a trick of the light
It's just a little illusion
Take a measure of spite
Add a little confusion

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, see your memory cutting in on you

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

Now the secret you're keeping
Is so well understood
Feel your past come creeping
You know you'd change it if you could

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, feel your memory crowding in on you

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

When it hits the fan
All the alibis wear thin
When your fur starts flying
Ah that's when the fun begins

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, see your memory come screaming through

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
I'm back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

// Livin' Alone //

The last time I saw you
I saw the writing on the wall
I didn't like it
I didn't like it at all
I look at my telephone
I let it ring and ring
I do the crying
Let the wire do the singing

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone
You know I got a heartache with me
I'm not living alone, living alone
You know I've got a heartbreak here

Just one more secret, just one more lie
I don't believe you, so don't you even try
You've been out all night, you say you've been bored
I know you too well, not to know when you've scored

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heart aching pain
Not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak again

I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I know I've got a heartbreak with me
I'm not living alone, living alone
I got a heartache, heartache
Not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here

I know my woman like the back of my hand
I know for sure, when she's taken another man
I'm going to cut my losses, going to walk through that door
I can't get her attention; I don't love her any more

I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone, living alone
Got a heart aching pain
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm Living with a heartache

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone
Living with a heartbreaker
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache

I tell you living alone, living alone
Living with a heartbreaker
I'm not living alone, living alone
Living with a heart aching here
