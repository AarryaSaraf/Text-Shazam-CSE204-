// Fairy Tale Lullaby //

If you want to ride a rainbow, come with me
I will take you to the magic purple sea
Maybe we will find a thousand sugar fish
When you eat them they will grant your every wish
And if you want your friends to come
Then bring them all along

If you want to catch a star then walk my way
I will take you where the night is always day
You can follow me if you really try
Maybe we will find a rainbow to teach it to fly
And if you want your friends to come
Then bring them all along

I will take you through the magic dancing wood
And I will take you where the goblins are all good
I will take you where the elfs and pixies do sing
And I will take you 'round the magic fairy ring
And if you want your friends to come
Then bring them all along

Bow your head and let your eyelids close on down
Where we're going you won't need to bring your frown
You will find that all the things that I have said
Will come true when you are lying in your bed
And if you want your friends to come
Then bring them all along

// Sandy Grey //

Oh Sandy Grey, are you going away?
Leave me a message before parting
Time has changed you and the things that pain you
Are the things you think of as you're starting

Oh Sandy Grey, it's only this I'll pray
That you might stay here one more day in laughter
Won't you hang around and hold me, repeat all the lies you told me?
Do your rambling after

Oh Sandy Grey, whatever made you want to stay?
And now what makes you want to be a-leaving?
Is it the same thing they found when they laid your father down
Or are your reasons even worth retrieving?

Oh Sandy Grey, don't leave me just today
Don't think on the road you'll be a-going
Think of all the time and the days we've had to mind
Of the future, there's no way of knowing

Oh Sandy Grey, I thought I heard you say
That you ain't heard one word that I've been speaking
There's no use in trying you escaping from my mind
And I'll never see the world you're seeking

Oh Sandy Grey, are you going away?
Leave me a message before parting
Time has changed you and the things that pain you
Are the things you think of as you're starting

// London Conversation //

In a foreign city once again
You waved weekly in the night
The early sun of London morning
Burned the darkness with unanswered light
But morning found you crying
Waiting for a woman
Where she left you in an empty state of mind
Waiting not for her but for relief from passing time

And a young friend talking softly
As the mist keeps tumbling down
But the woman waiting for him near
Stayed and told you of the peace that could be found
And a fallen heart was woken
In your tired waiting time
And you thought you might begin again
From all the ashes of your mind

And though he used no poetry
His words are weaving songs
And the peace they were recalling
Were good roads that you might have walked along
And the skies you saw were all the same
Although his words were not your own
But the words and images you've spoken
Are the ashes from a peace you'd never known

// Ballad Of An Elder Woman //

Now woman, don't you feel sad when you see your life go round
And you realise that you've been drinking all of your years like wine?
You're gambling with time and you know you just can't win
But still you feel that somehow you've just got to keep on trying
And woman, it's your heart, I hear crying

Now the young man by your side is your husband, or so you say
In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms
Oh but his youth has made you hate to see his face
And woman, it's your heart, I see crying

Now you're standing like some tree oh and the blossom has blown away
And the last leaf has gone crumbling, tumbling towards the ground
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you have found
And woman, it's your heart, I hear crying

// Cocaine //

Did you hear a story about cocaine, Lill?
She had a cocaine house on cocaine hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine rat
And it's all round my brain

Been walking around 10th street and main
I've been looking for a girlie to give me cocaine
Cocaine sure running round my brain
Been strolling round 10th street and main
Been looking for someone to give me cocaine
Cocaine, sure running round my brain

Well, cocaine Lill and morphine Sue
They've been strolling down the avenue, two by two
Says Lill to Sue, it's gonna do no harm
If we both have a little old shot in the arm
And it's all round my veins, oh cocaine

Doctor tell me again and again
He says, cocaine's forces ain't for men
Cocaine sure running round my brain
You know the doctor tells me, tells me again and again
He says, cocaine will kill you son, it won't say when
Cocaine sure running round my brain

There's this story about cocaine, Lill
She had a cocaine house on cocaine hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine rat
And it's all round my brain

Yonder's baby, she's dressed in white
I said, hey now mama, gonna stay all night
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
Now there runs my baby, she's all dressed in black
You said, you know I didn't mean it, won't you please come back?
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

Hey baby, please come quick
This old cocaine's making me sick
Cocaine sure running round my brain

// Run Honey Run //

Well, I wish I could think of some clich√© to mouth
To make our parting seem less sad
But if I told you lies, or promised you the moon
The truth would come trickling from my eyes
So run honey run, and hide in the wind
And never stop to look inside your mind

Well, I wish I could wash all my weeping blues away
And watch them disappear on morning tide
But I seek after sword, after sounds of the sea
A charm forever around my mind
So run honey run, and hide in the wind
And never stop to look inside your mind

And I wish I could fly like a bat from a cave
Through darkness of my ignorance to light
I'd forever live on the echoes of our love
And die like some star burning bright
And run honey run, and hide in the wind
And never stop to look inside your mind

// Back To Stay //

Although I've been away so many lonely nights
You know I'm back today
I'm back to stay in your arms
And though I've been around and lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
Honey, all I do is worth nothing
And girlie, don't cry for me

Although there might be other people in my life
Honey, on my mind
You will always find there's only you
And though you say you'll journey to some foreign land
I'll remember you
Yes, and I'll be true to your memory
And girlie, don't cry for me

And when, at last, you do come wandering home to me
I might look at you
But it will be through the weeks between
And when I hold you, it might not be you I have
In the passing days
We might both have changed to something new
And girlie, don't cry for me

And though I've been away so many lonely nights
You know I'm back today
I'm back to stay in your arms
And though I've been around and lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
Honey, all I do is worth nothing
And girlie, don't cry for me

// Rolling Home //

Rolling home
Sun's around my shoulders
Rolling home
I feel it getting colder
In my ear I hear the birds cry
Cry into the land
While beneath my feet the ship flies
Flies into the sand

Rolling home
Rolling home
Thoughts returning
Thoughts of what I told her
Thoughts returning
Thoughts as I get older

In my mind I hear her crying
Crying in the wind
In my mind I hear her crying
Her tears, they wheel and spin
Rolling home
I'm rolling home

Golden dawns
Are shining all around me
Golden dawns
That really think they've found me
And I know I will be happy
And laugh behind the song
And I know I will be happy
When she and I are one
Rolling home
I'm rolling home

// Who's Grown Up Now //

On this June morning
I give you warning
I might just fly away across the dawn
I looked into my lover's eyes
There I saw the sunrise
There I saw the birth of something new

And suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
'Cause I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

Since the time she went away
I just exist from day to day
I can't live, I can't love without her near
Sitting here in my darkened room
Whistling through the velvet gloom
Wondering what the hell I'm doing here

For suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
And I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

There's just me and my conscience now
There's no one to tell me why or how
I fell away; it's time I must return
We might recover what has been
Turn all the pieces round again
Change and rearrange, begin again

And suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
'Cause I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

On this June morning
I give you warning
I might just fly away across the dawn
Since the day she went away
I just exist from day to day
I can't live, I can't love without her near

For suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
And I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

// Golden Girl //

I see in the green stream that meanders round my mind
A girl standing with arms so warm and kind
She reaches out, she calls my name
But I just can't get through

I know that she's waiting, in a land of sunny rain
And I know that I'll find my girl and it's there I will remain
I'll lay right down, and there I'll stay
'Cause there is paradise

I've often felt her breathing, as I rolled round your streets
And so I look around me, but we'd never chance to meet
The golden girl with eyes of green
A girl just meant for me

I see in the green stream that meanders round my mind
A girl standing with arms so warm and kind
She's standing there, she calls my name
But I just can't get through

// This Time //

I'm putting you right out of my life
Ain't going to see you for quite some time
I'm fading away in the morning sun
Maybe behind it, I'll find someone

Baby, why do you sneak into my mind
Why do you haunt me all the time
Why don't you go and leave me be
Why don't you go and leave me free?
This time
Stop me if you think you can

Oh, we had a love that lived and died
When it was over there was no one to cry
So now that it's gone without one tear
I reckon it's time that I was not here

Baby, why do you sneak into my mind
Why do you haunt me all the time
Why don't you go and leave me be
Why don't you go and leave me free?
This time
Stop me if you think you can

Been flitting around your scene too long
Reckon it's time I was travelling on
Oh baby, if you don't want me to go
Why are you whispering my name so low

Baby, why do you sneak into my mind
Why do you haunt me all the time
Why don't you go and leave me be
Why don't you go and leave me free?
This time
Stop me if you think you can

// Don't Think Twice It's Alright //

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
It just don't matter anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out of your window, I'll be gone
You're the reason that I'm travelling on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl
Like you never done before
It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl
I just can't hear you any more
I wish there was something that you might do or say
To make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use you turning on your light, babe
The light that I never knew
It ain't no use you turning on your light, baby
'Cause I'm on the dark side of the road
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better, I just don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walking down my long lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, baby
So I'll just say Fare thee well
I'm thinking and I'm wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't think twice, it's all right

// She Moved Through The Fair //

My young love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
It will not be long, love
Till our wedding day

She stepped away from me
And she went through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Move here and move there

And then she went homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

Last night she came to me
My true love came in
And softly she came
That her feet made no din

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
It will not be long, love
Till our wedding day
