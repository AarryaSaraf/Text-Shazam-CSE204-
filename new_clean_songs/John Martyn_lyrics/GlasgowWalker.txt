// So Sweet //

In, In, In, In
Well it gets so strange when standing head to head
It gets so sweet side by side
Feels so strange end to end
So much sweeter side by side

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

C'mon take the edge off, like some kind of topiary
Take the edge off darling, just lie down with me
Oh so sweet, oh so sweet

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

Unchained and unrestrained
So loud so quiet, yet so proud
Unchained unrestrained
Side by side in a crowd

So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet this painful freedom
So sweet

Well it gets so strange when standing head to head
It gets so sweet side by side
Feels so strange end to end
So much sweeter side by side

So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love

So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love
So sweet the upward surge of freedom
So sweet the search for perfect love

// Wildflower //

Take all your faith and put it in me
Take all your sweet love and give it to me
Everyone of your passions, all the lessons so hard
Take everyone of your little missions put your hand on your heart and tell me
I've been spitting on the sweetest word that was ever written

All of my reason all my logic, seems so spent
Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Everywhere everyday the all seeing eye gives me visions of you
To holding me heart and keeping me hand
All of them glances all the chances I took, I gave 'em all to you
I gave 'em all to you
My resolve is week, sometimes staggering from street to street

But I still love wildflowers, and I still love my rose
Give me your faith all your love all you passion too

Teach me the lessons you leaned so hard teach me through and through
Help this helpless heart of mine
Wait here 'til the storm is over, oh don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Take all your faith and put it in me
Take all your sweet love and give it to me
Everyone of your passions, all the lessons so hard
Everyone of your missions, put your hand on your heart
I believe I been smitten by the sweetest word ever written

All of my reason all my logic, seems so spent
Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, please don't go

Wait here 'til the storm is over, darling please don't go
Wait here 'til the rain stops falling on me, oh don't leave me so

Don't you leave me here don't you leave me, oh no
You got to wait 'til the rain stops falling, falling on me
You got to wait 'til the storm is over come on, stay by me
Darling, please don't go

// The Field Of Play //

The fields they redden slowly
As every player is laid low
The guns are never silenced
As every single orphan knows

Time may break your heart, your love will go on forever
Time may break your heart, your love will carry on
Time may break your heart, your love will go on forever
Time may break your heart, your love will carry on

Evening turns to darkness
Just as the clich√© always says
The rain begins to fall
The mayhem, the madness, and it all
End it all right now with the last war

Time may break your heart, your love will go on forever
Time may break your heart, your love will carry on
Time may break your heart, your love will go on forever
Time may break your heart, your love will carry on

Tell me
Time can break your heart, your love will carry forward
Time will break your heart. love will carry on
Time will break your heart, these wars and troubles only

These wars and time might try to break your heart but love will carry on
The fields seem so empty now, no enemies left
Your heart is sore, your mind bereft
The time you got gonna break your heart
The time you got maybe break your heart
But your love?

Time can't break my heart
Time may break your heart, all the madness, all the mayhem flies away
You got the power of love
Time will break your heart but your own love will carry on
The love you have inside, impeccable, unstoppable

Believable, believable, it's the love you have inside
You know yourself

// Cool In This Life //

Life has been good to me, I been good to this life
Life's been cool with me, I been cool all my life
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby
Life was sitting right with me, I was sitting right with life
I was sitting right with my children, they were sitting right with my wife

Saddened by life from time to time
Saddened by my presence don't open 'em 'til Christmas
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby, try for me baby
Sometimes I cry, just like a baby try for me baby, try for me baby

Off of your knees c'mon up and try me
Get off of your knees c'mon up and try
Off of your knees come and try a man like me
Stop your crying, stop that crying

Life been good to you, you been so good to this life
Life will be cool with you if you're cool with life
It could be bad for you, could be worse for me
Dear Lord don't you know you gotta try

Sometimes I cry, just like a baby
Raise my standards high
Wave my flag and raise my standard high

Try a man like me
Try a man like me
Try a man like me
Try a man like me

Raise my standards high
Raise them standards high
Raise them standards high

Wave the flag
C'mon, try a man like me
C'mon, try a man like me

Raise my standards high, try a man like me
Raise my standards high, try a man like me

// Feel So Good //

Really gotta tell you today that I feel so good, gotta tell somebody
I feel so good every time you say you love me
I feel so good every time you say you care
I feel so good every time you say you love me
It just feel so good to know that you are there

Oh never think about leaving me, oh how this child would cry
Never think about leaving this boy
Can you imagine, imagine, imagine the hue and cry?
I feel so good

I just feel so good when you tell me that your mine
I feel so good, so happy, every time you say you love me
I feel so good when you're giving me your time

Don't you ever think about leaving, oh no
Oh my the hue and cry, don't cry
Never think about leaving this boy
Some part of my heart might just up and die

I just feel so good to see you smiling sweetly
I just feel so good when you cause my sun to shine
I feel so good I just have to cry discreetly
I feel so good 'cause you make me feel divine

Don't ever think about leaving this boy, imagine the hue and cry
Don't you ever think about leaving this boy
Oh please never even try
Oh please don't you never even try

I feel so good every time you say you love me
I feel so good every time you say you care
I feel so good every time you say you love me
It just feel so good to know that you are there

Don't ever think about leaving, how this child might cry
Don't ever think about leaving me, oh the hue and cry
Oh please don't ever try
Don't you leave me child, 'cause I feel so good
I feel so good, I just feel so good
I just feel so good

// Cry Me A River //

Now you say you love me
But you cry the whole night through
You can cry me a river
Oh yes you're going to cry me a river
Cos I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue
You may cry a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Yes I did child, yes I did my child

You drove me nearly out of my head
You stood by and never shed a tear
But I remember every word that was said
Oh yes, I remember, never fear

You may cry me a river, c'mon now
Cry me a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you oh how I cried

You nearly drove me out of my own sweet head
You stood by, you never shed a tear for me
I remember every cruel word, everything that was said
Yes I remember, never you fear

You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you
Yes I cried a river for you

Turn back the tide of life, I cried, salty water running down
I cried I love you
I cried I love you
I cried, I cried

You may cry, oh, she may cry now, a river of tears
A river of tears for you
You may cry now, she may cry, oh, she may cry now
You may cry, oh, she may cry now a river of tears
A river of tears for you

I cry you can cry me a river
Lord loves a cheerful giver
C'mon and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now and cry me a river of tears
C'mon now, c'mon down and cry me a river

// Mama T //

Hey Mama T, hey Mama T-razor stepping down the street
Mama sing T-razor Mama T, Mama T, look what you done to this child
Oh we're living so quiet on the street out there
I didn't have a notion, not one bull's notion or a care
I went swinging oh from gutter to gutter, you could almost smell me

Mama T come looking for me, Mama T-razor just as sharp as a knife
Mama T-razor come looking for me, Mama T you bring me roses every day
My Mama T bring me roses every day, Mama T bring me roses every day
My Mama T bring me roses every day

Lying down, keeping quiet, don't know what, start a riot
Well I ain't got my gloves on
I don't care about the town square
I don't care about New Delhi, otherwise
Only Mama T-razor saved me, Mama T-razor come and help me up

Mama T, Mama T, my Mama T, my Mama T little a razor come up and saved me
Gutter to gutter, ghetto to ghetto, get to hell
Who knows how they smell?
Who know who the lepers are, who the unclean are
Tell me who the lepers are, who the unclean are

Mama T-razor gonna tell you now, Mama T-razor stepping up and out
Mama T-Razor, sharp as you like
Mama T-razor sharper than any marlinspike
The marlin, the marlin, the marlin, the marlin
Here come that swordfish, gonna cut you down like a little sharp razor

Razor sharp like Mama T, going to cut you
Mama T, get it together
Mama T, get it together
Mama T, spread my bed with roses every day
Spread my bed with roses every day
Every flower in the rainbow, they all belong to me
They came from Mama T

Mother Theresa stepping up on me
Mother T, all them roses
Cover me with roses every day
She cover me with them roses and them flowers

Red?
Indigo?
Must you go?
Here come, here come the Saffron
Here come that gofor, run
Here come the Twyler
You can throw me roses every day
Like Mama T

// Can't Live Without //

I can live without a broken heart
If you can live within my dreams
The flags are out on a sunny day
All the troubles I have just fade away

When I'm living in the right place
Alliteration comes to mind
The sweetest smile I'll ever find on your face
I can live without a broken heart, you could live within my dreams
I could live without a broken heart if you could live within my dreams

What might have been such a tragic scene just changes
Moves smoothly oh so smoothly into time
I will try it can't deny it if I need it I will bleed for it
Cos it never tastes the same it never tastes the same to me

I can live without a broken heart, you could live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, you can live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, you can live within my dreams
I could live without a broken heart if you could live within my dreams

The flags are out on a sunny day
All the troubles fade away, it never tastes the same
Alliteration comes to mind, the sweetest smile I'll ever find
It never feels the same without you

I can live without a broken heart, if you could live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, if you could live within my dreams
I could live without
I could live without
Could live without
Without
I could live without

// The Cat Won't Work Tonight //

Running jumping standing still a ghoul up there
Some goon up on Glastonbury Tor
Been itching

The cat can't work tonight
The cat just will not work tonight
I know that the cat won't work tonight
I tell you this cat won't work tonight

You can watch the sun fall in to my sweetest embrace
You can even try to show me some baptist better place
You can watch me as I try to fly
Watch the stars as your heart tries not to cry

The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight
I'm telling you, the cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight
The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight

Been itching, been scratching, been stopping, been starting
Got a face like a hatchet, mother like a spanner with a half shut knife
Out on the tiles with me all the time
Walking, fooling, child's and wives

The cat won't work, won't work tonight
I tell you the cat won't work, won't work tonight, oh no
The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight

Running, jumping, standing still
Like a goon up there on Goon Hilly Down
Watch the dilly dilly run, huh, let them talents fall down

The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight, I'm telling you
The cat can't work, the cat can't work tonight
Looking like a cat's paw, feeling like a rabbits foot
Maybe get lucky but it must be good
The cat can't work, the cat don't work tonight

Too busy itching and scratching, looking the patch right over
Too busy scratching and itching, looking out for bitching
I tell you now the cat don't work
The cat don't work tonight
The cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight
The cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight

Some other time, send me a line
Too busy itching, scratching, bitching, hatching plots and schemes and plans
Just can't work
The cat don't work, the can don't work tonight

// You Don't Know What Love Is //

You don't know what love is
Until you know the meaning of the blues
Till you love the love you had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you flipped your heart and found you were lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The very thought of reminiscing
And how loved lips that taste of tears
Soon lose their taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
The love that cannot live but never dies
Until you greet each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The very thought of reminiscing
And how loved lips that taste of tears
Soon lose the taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
The love that cannot live but never dies
Until you face each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

You don't know what love is
You don't know
What love is
You don't know
