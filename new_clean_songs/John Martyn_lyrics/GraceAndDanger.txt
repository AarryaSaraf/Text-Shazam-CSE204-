// Some People Are Crazy //

Some people are crazy about him
Some people can't stand his face
Some people they smile when they know he's coming
Some people chase him out of the place

But this loving kind of business
Might make your poor heart glad
Yes this loving kind of business
Might be the best find you ever had
The best find you ever had

Some people are crazy
Some people are just plain good
Some people talk wouldness and couldness
Some people don't do as they should

But this loving kind of business
Might make your poor heart glad
Yes this loving kind of business
Might be the best thing that you ever had
The best find you ever had

Some people got a glass eye
Some people got a window to watch
Some people draw conclusions like curtains
Ah, don't they draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight

Ah, some people are crazy about him
Some people they can't stand his face
Some people they laugh when they know he's coming
Some people chase him out of the place

Some people are crazy
Some people are just like me

Some people are crazy
Some people are just like me

// Grace And Danger //

You know I wished you all you wish yourself
It makes me feel so good to know you've found somebody else
You want a word from me
I'll give you two
I mutter desperately darling
As you say goodbye
As I start to cry

Grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger

Sort of pretty in an ugly sort of way
Jagging strokes and hustling folks every live long day
My heart goes out to you
I think of me
I mutter desperately darling
As they say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly

Grace and danger
Grace and danger

I never knew the road that carried me along
Crazy sidewalk, concealed by pretty song
You want my life from me
I'll give you two
You'll be no strife for me
As we say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly

Grace and danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Grace and danger

// Lookin' On //

What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind a silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Lookin' on
I'm just lookin' on

My cynic friends maintain
A low profile with a high disdain
I think I'll try once more to make friends
With the wolves that live at my door
And come stealing in, with their innocent grin
And leave me staring
At the empty ceiling
Feeling absolutely nothing
Lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on, lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on

What kind of mood will change
Or ease this subtle flame
What warm and blissful rain
Might doubt your trust again
For that beautiful thing
That once made my poor heart sing
Beautiful thing
It's never going to leave me
Believe me now

Just lookin', just lookin'
Just lookin', just lookin', just lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on

What kind of mind will find
Such a strange and empty time
Draw the finest line
Between loving and being too cruel to be kind
To let love come stealing in
With an innocent grin
Leave you staring at the empty ceiling
Feeling nothing
Just lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Just lookin'; lookin', lookin'

What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind the silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Just look: just lookin' on
I'm just lookin'
Just lookin' on

Lookin' on

// Johnny Too Bad //

Walking down the road
With no blade in your hand
Johnny you're too bad, that's what they say
Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Oh Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
With your blade come flicking
You're licking, and sticking
Too bad
With your running, and shooting, looting and tooting
You're too bad

Cos one of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Ooh, Johnny too bad
One of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Cos Johnny, you're so bad
Ooh, that's what they tell me about you
With you licking and sticking
Switchblade a picking
Too bad
With you're looting, you're shooting, looting, your tooting
You're too bad
That's what they say about you

Walking down the road
You're going to hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You be walking down the road
You'might hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You might run to the rock for rescue
You'll find no rock, you'll find no rock there
Run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock, be no rock at all

Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road
With a blade in your, with a blade your waist
You're too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny
With your blade a picking, switchblade licking
Too bad
With your licking and sticking, blade come picking
Too bad, that's what they say about you
With your blade come licking, licking, sticking
That's what they say about you
Licking, sticking, too bad

Ooh, Johnny go talking

Johnny go walking now
Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking out
Johnny go walking

// Sweet Little Mystery //

Just that sweet little mystery that breaks my heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
O that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

My friends all tell me that I look so sad
They don't need to ask me why
They know the reason that I feel so bad
Since the night you said goodbye
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the dead of the night
That keeps me hanging on, waiting for the end

Just that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

I watch the street, I watch the radio
I don't need to turn it on
Another friend comes by and tries to say hello
Another weekend's almost gone
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

The time is flying fast, and I don't care
To spend another night alone
I want to see you, but I don't know where
Till then I'm walking on my own
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

That sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

Sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery

// Hurt In Your Heart //

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call

Darling, that's all that you have to do
Show me a sign
A word or a line
One stitch in time
To save this poor heart
From breaking

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
I'll still be your friend

Right to the end of our river
And further still
This hurt it will mend
And I hope you'll remember all the time
Hope you'll remember every line
Hope you'll remember
All the love, all the love, all the love

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Just say my name

You don't have to say it loud
I'll still feel the same
I'll still be true
Waiting for you
To come sailing through
Cos I you know you can

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call

// Baby Please Come Home //

Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby, please, come home
I'll try to put the things we've done
Back where they belong
And that's in the past
I need our love to last

But I feel somehow to blame
For the way our love has changed
But please believe me
I just can't stand to see you go
And I swear that I don't know
Just what made me hurt you so
What made you want to go

Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby please, baby please, baby please, come home
Try to put the things I said
Right out of your head
I didn't mean a single one
Now you see what words have done

Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby please, baby please, baby please, baby please come home
Try to put the things we've done
Back where they belong
That's in the past
I need our love to last

Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby baby, please come home, please come home

// Save Some (For Me) //

Save some
Save some
Just save some
Won't you save some for me
Please save some
Won't you save some for me

Oh, I felt so crazy when I read your little letter
Saying you were never coming home
Every day I wake up, now I feel a little better
Cos the way I live I'll never be alone

Save some
Try to save some for me
Oh Won't you save some
Please save some for me

I told my friends about us, and the way you feel about me
Through your teeth with every second word
I felt you like Ophelia in a repertory failure
Demented in a theatre absurd

Oh but I saved some
You didn't get it all, 'cause I
Save some for me
Yes, I save some
Ooh tell you, I save some for me

Should you read about me when you read your silly papers
Just pretend you never knew my name
Should I ever feature you when you
Talk to your, talk to your, talk to your neighbours
Tell them that I never played the game

Cos I saved some
You didn't get it all
Cos I saved some for me
Oh yes, I saved some
(I cheated on the side)
Yes I saved some for me

Yes I saved some
You didn't get it all, didn't get it all
Cos I save some for me
Yes I saved some
Oh darling, saved some for me

Just a little bit, just a little bit for me
Just a little bit, saved some
Won't you save some
Won't you save some for me

// Our Love //

Oh baby, take a look
Take a look in your heart for me, baby
Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart

Our love
Once was sweeter than the April rain
But now I have to beg before you even say my name
Our love
Once was warmer than a summer's day
And now I have to ask before you even want to look my way

People go talking
People go talking around
Putting us down, putting us down
Putting us down, putting us down
People go talking
But they don't talk to me
I know they just don't see

Our love
Once was you and me against this world
Made a man from a boy
And made a woman from a little girl
Our love
Once was deeper than the darkest blue could be
Now I find
I have to search my mind
To find the smallest trace of you in me

Lovers part
You can read about it
Can read about it every day
Read about it every day
Lovers part
Then they just walk away

Our love
Once was sweeter than the April rain to me
Now I find I have to beg before you call my name
Please call my name, please call my name, and

Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart
Baby take a look, take a good look, baby
Baby take a look in your heart
Baby take a look, baby take a look
Baby take a look in your heart for me
Ah baby, please baby

// Small Hat //

Big word, inspirational
Big man in such a big way
It's a small time human issue
In a cold world that throws you away

You just keep on trying
You can watch 'em crying
You can see 'em loving
Those dreams stick far above him

You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never know your love till it's gone
You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never really know your love till it's
Gone

He's a good soul, sad mind
But he knows how he wants it to be
He's as close as your bread
He's as far as your light
He's as fearless as the life left in me

He just keeps on trying
He can watch 'em crying
He just keeps on loving
Those dreams stick far above him

You never know a friend till he says goodbye
Your never know a friend till he's gone
You never know a girl till she makes you cry
You never know your love till it's gone

Small word, inspirational
Big man in a big way
Short time human issue
It's a small mind that throws you away

Just keep on loving
Just keep on trying
You just keep on crying
Those dreams stay way above him

He say
You never know a friend till he passes you by
You never know a friend till he's gone

Your never know a friend till he's
Gone...

// Running Up The Harbour //

Sometimes I wish that I had never seen your face
Sometimes I wish that you would never show me to the place
Sometimes I wish that I could be better than I am
Sometimes I wish that I was still your loving man

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You take me so high
You leave me so low

A cool cool time
For running up the harbour
It's a cool cool time
For going to see your father
A cool cool time
For running on the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For a place you never been before

You never been before
You never been before
You never been before

And now you set me up and you leave me on the road
For all the love we had I just don't have a line
You tell me all those years were just a waste of time

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You take me so high
You leave me so low

It's a cool cool time
For running up the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For a scene you never seen before
A cool cool time
For running up the harbour
Such a cool cool time
For going to see your father

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You leave me so high
You take me, take me down so low

It's a a cool cool time
For running up the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For something you never seen before
It's a cool cool time
For running up the harbour
A cool cool time
For going to see my father

Go and see my father
Go see my father
Go see my father

Go see, go see, go see, go see
Go see, go see, go see, go see

Allo blondini!
Sullo percussion
El basso profundo
I grosso con petito
E con avante
Un avanta la guarda

Si el dentisto rorcho
Extramarito el dentisto
Removo el conno
Give it some spico
El porto al niente
Al dente!

You take me
You leave me
You take me
You leave me

// Dead On Arrival //

Died on a plane, no pain, got nowhere to go
Broken black days you talked to the radio
Man by your side says he's trying to understand
But you're sick to your soul 'cause you know that he don't give a damn

You know that all he
Wants you to be
All he
Wants you to be
All he wants is just a heavy young man

Too young for small time, you're big time in no time at all
Buying your time everywhere, you make time for them all
Man by your side brings you here for just one more show
But you're dead on arrival, fast faded and nowhere to go

And all he
Wants you to be
All he
Wants you to be
All he wants is just a heavy young man
Heavy young man

Round about Memphis they come round and give you a shake
But you're up and away, you had all any man could take
It's dead on arrival, child and it's such a shame
There's nobody else in this world but yourself to blame

For all you
Wanted to be
All you
Wanted to be
All you wanted was a heavy young man
Ah just heavy young man

// After Tomorrow Night //

Ever since I was a young boy
I've been tongue-tied and shy
Ah in that train, just yesterday
I saw you riding by

You have got to think about position
And I've got to think about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Oh tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

Woke up this morning
Gave you a thought
So I laid down and gave you one more
I've been plotting, scheming
Hoping, dreaming
All day about trying to score

You've got a thing about about position
And I've got a thing about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

I've been crossing my knees
I've been darking my eyes
I'm in line with my peacenik queues
Well I straighten my head
Then I iron my tie
And I wonder what suit to choose

I've got a thing about about position
And I've gotta think about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Oh tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
