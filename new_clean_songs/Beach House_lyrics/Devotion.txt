Album: Devotion

// Wedding Bell //

Hello
You're humming tomorrow's never songs

But you're singing the only words you know
Would you cry, If I lied
On the dam

I chose yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell ell ell
And we're swimming the seas we known so well
I've tried to stay alive, in our bed, in our head

Oh, but your wish is my command

Ahhhh
Is your heart still mine to sail
I enjoy
Nothing
ahhhh

I chose yeah
You're ring the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we known so well
I tried staying alive in our bed in our head

Oh, but your wish is my command

// You Came To Me //

Invite your sister
into the garden
all cannot play
fist full of wild flowers
hand picked by someone
who nearly fell

(ahhh, ahhh)

friend foe or feather
if we roll together
give my gift to you
in all kinds of weather
if not now not ever
please do not go

hands over your eyes
recalling your size
is it the right time
for the game we play
in all kinds of weather
if not now not ever
this is the right time
for a holiday

(la, la, la, la)

you came to me
in my dreams
and you spoke of everything
sweeter than the days that I was breathing
how on earth did anything...

// Gila //

Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back
So don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I am blessed with a kingdom, half mine.

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a

// Turtle Island //

Down the hill I hoped that I'd find
Something I could rest my hands on
In the distant sun is setting
Deer are jumping over hedges

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping
Silently, I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...

In the waters, trace her features,
Did they scare you, hardened creatures
In that murky, green perfection
Did they warn you of dissection...
How? What, why, when...?

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping
Silently, I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...

How I want Olive to know,
That inside me she'll always grow.
In all colors and prizes
You will always
Remain

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...

// Holy Dances //

In the night I called your
name - heart of mine
one letter at a time.
I'll be found in a
land of savages
Ah-h...

Maybe you
don't know what you've got,
spent yer money on
desert lots -
holy dances and acronyms
for her.

Bury your maps, they'll find
all you pots and pans
cross all your hands, one
finger at a time
you'll be found in a
land of savages ah-h...

Maybe you don't know what
you've got,
husk to hide and I know you're
not, spending money
on a desert rose -
holy dances and acronyms
for bones.

// All The Years //

I was sitting on a rock, just
waiting for a key
to sleep inside the house
of old serenity

So I climbed onto your altar
begged, please don't let me falter,
we'll put our oaths at stake
in a heaven that all icicles make.

All my devotion,
compelled by an ocean,
of all the years to come
of all the years to come

So we'll work until the night is quite
what once all our dreams were like;
doing all the housework, returning all the
schoolbooks, for good

Let's go on pretending that the light
is neverending -
we still have the summers
to be good to one another, yay hey

// Heart Of Chambers //

In your heart of chambers
where you sit
with your picture books
and your ancient wit
In that nook I found you
so old and tired
would you be the one to carry me?
I'd like to be someone
you could finally learn to love again

Made our iron bed side
cold as graves
so we stoke the organs
that may comfort grace
and they conjured spirits
to make you smile
would you be my long time baby?

I'd like to be someone
you could finally learn to...
We've put our words down
by our sides
let's take the time
to mend these smiles
together we could make it home
love is a prize
live our own lives

In our beds we're the lucky ones
filled with the sun
In our beds we're the lucky ones
fill us with the sun

// Some Things Last A Long Time //

Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall.
The colors are bright, bright as ever.
Red is strong.
Blue is true.

Some things last a long time.
Some things last a long time.

// Astronaut //

Come over to my house
I'll pour some tea for us
one sugar or two
Your hand is right in front of me,
your finger fragilely, holy on
my side

Faster than an astronaut
who's coming home to what
he left long ago
I've made this brand new bed for
you, I trust the things we do,
holy or not

open the gate cause you're already late,
at the end of the lane, is a glass of
lemona-ade, keep or the path when
you hear the laugh, in the white of her
Palm is your heart!

{I'll be brave for a while
I won't bring you down
anymore than you are}

Please, be my baby, don't mean
maybe or not, look out the
window, there's a bright
yellow cat...

// D.A.R.L.I.N.G. //

Where did you come from
You're no stranger
How I know
you will return
so I won't be sad
D.A.R.-L.I.N.
G - .....

In that harbor of a room
you'll find your anchor soon
in the parting of our ways
may it never happen
any way

In the highest blackened moon
there'd be more life
in the right shade of our
sighs, Death!, be gone!
D.A.R.-L.I-N.G.-.. ..

In that harbor of a room
you'll find your anchor soon
in the parting of our ways
may it never happen
anyway...

All of your charms
couldn't keep you from...

// Home Again //

Home again, driven back
She's still waiting for a friend

Little purple organdy,
Remember what you've always meant to me

Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

Heaven, baby, is in an hour
With your heart in handfuls, forbidden flowers
Bread and bonnets along the way
Better take your chances while there's still a ray

Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?

Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean?
