Album: 7

// Dark Spring //

Dark red
Light years
Brought near

Cold gun
Glowing
Night scene

Started
Remain
Brought fear

I want to lie in
The cold Orion
The colour's missing
Upon the dark spring

Cold wind
Light years
Brought near

Dark gun
Glowing
Night scene

The world's colliding
A new dividing
The colour's missing
Upon the dark spring

// Pay No Mind //

Pay no mind
It takes time
What's that you say

Down the hall
I heard a song
Who knows
Drifting away

Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes

All of me
Is to tow the waste
What's that you say
It's going away

It's painful but
You do what you must
Takes time to know

Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes

Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
Kiss of love couldn't be much colder

// Lemon Glow //

Read my fortune too
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play, I do it every day
I promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
Still, it's coming back
I come alive
You stay all night

Feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
You feel it coming right through you
You feel it coming right through you
It's on the other side
It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way
The color of your mind

It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night
It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night

Candy-colored mystery
The color of your mind

// L'Innconue //

Seven girls
At the end of day
She who sings
She who prays
Side by side
In a line
See their eyes

Eyes that show
Eyes that show what's you
True today
Seven ways
Eyes that shine
Silent skies
Show a way

What is you
Where is she today
Saw my girl
From within
She who sways
She who spins
Seventh girl

Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
Vers l'eglise et vers la Seine
Toute leurs cœurs et toute leur peine

Petit ange et l'inconnue
Sainte, la pute et l'ingénue
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes

Little girl, you could be loved
Little girl, you should be loved
The moment you say you know
Is the moment you are

Little girl, you could be loved
Little girl, you should be loved
The moment you say you know
Is the moment you are

Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes
Vers l'eglise et vers la Seine
Toute leurs cœurs et toute leur peine

Petit ange et l'inconnue
Sainte, la pute et l'ingénue
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept
Toutes les filles ne sont pas prêtes

// Drunk In LA //

Can't help seeking corners
Of dark and dead end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm

Isolation tenders
Something fragile coming soon
Skinny angels making eyes at cameras
Perched in every room

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
Memory's a sacred meat
That's drying all the time
On a hillside I remember
I am loving losing life

Strawberries in springtime
Pretty happy accidents
My awareness that I'm lucky
Rolling clouds over cement

Maybe there's a screenplay
Or a bathroom I can hide
Down the hallways of a high school
And the dances left behind

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
I would climb the Eiffel Tower
Write letters on the sky
How many turns it took to reach you

I had a good run playing horses in my mind
On a hillside I remember
I am loving losing life

// Dive //

Tell her something (Tell her something)
Tell her nothing (Tell her nothing)
Tell her that you waited

And I know you like it
So you try to hide it

I was looking (I was looking)
Out the window (Out the window)
All the people waited

Tell her something (Tell her something)
Tell her nothing (Tell her nothing)
Tell her that you waited

And I know you like it
So you try to hide it

And I know I like it
So I dive to find it

Empires lost in confusion
Golden hearts left of illusion
You said my big imagination
Shattered, flickered creation

And hide over the ocean
Waves crash in chemical motion

Left of illusion
Left of illusion

// Black Car //

We want to go inside the cold
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
And in the time before it ends
When the stillness bends

We want to go inside the cold
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
And in the time before it ends
When the stillness bends

I skipped a rock and it fell to the bottom
I skipped a rock

Each time I'm walking at night
And I can't close my eyes
And I can't close my eyes

Each time
We want to go inside the cold
At night
It's like a tomb, but it's something to hold
Eyes
And in the time before it ends
Close my eyes
When the stillness bends

I skipped a rock and it fell to the bottom
I skipped a rock

// Lose Your Smile //

Outside looking in
Mirrors once again
Nothing left to say
Tomorrow's gone today

Lose your smile
Lose your smile

Sweet lies on your face
Tears are out of place
Sunshine in the rain
Comes in rainbows and leaves again

Lose your smile
Lose your smile

When all the while, child
It's your own self giving in
Who's to blame this time?

Lose your smile
Lose your smile

Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true
Dreams, baby, do come true

// Woo //

I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

When she closes her eyes
Looks inside
Never knowing
Shooting for the stars
It's gone too far
And you know it

I can't keep you there
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
You're everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
Forever glowing
You break all the rules

It's a trick of the eye
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
It passes me by
In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
Keeps on going
Backseat, give a fuck

I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

You're my trick of the eye
I want it all
That passes me by
But I can't have it
Keeps on going
I can't keep you there
It inches by, but
Or everywhere
I cannot say much
Forever glowing
You're my trick of the eye
But I want it all
That passes me by
And I want it all
Keeps on going

// Girl Of The Year //

You slide out on sunset
Head west on bedrest
On your own
On your own

Get dressed to undress
Depressed to impress
All night long
All night long

Turn on the TV
They all wanna see me
Come undone
Come undone

Pick all the petals
Off all the daisies
One by one

The feeling's here
The pattern caught in a falling tear
And in the waves
One goes and the other one knows
(One house) The feeling's here
(She wore) The pattern caught in a falling tear
(Too soon) And in the ways
One goes and the other one knows

Baby's gone
All night long
Baby's gone
All night long

// Last Ride //

There she goes
Under the sun
Some question there

Roll her eyes
Blonde, your hair
Fake eyelashes

Sun came up
Baby went black
And she rolled over

There she goes
Around the bend
The sun is slow
Unknown friend

There she goes
The sun went bad
The cycle ends

Who takes your name back
When he said he's four streets from your bed
And I'm loving and sick

There she goes
On her bike
Earth to the side

When you're loving most at night
And I love you back
When the sun rises, I...
Who will call you back?

It's a whisper
It's just a whisper
It's just a whisper
