// Just Be Yourself //

Alot of people say that you can make it in this world today.
But, I know exactly how, I'd like to show ya if you let me now.

Just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line just be yourself.
Just be yourself put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it.
Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

Sometimes it might take long to clear your mind and make yourself feel strong. 

I know its worth the wait just tighten up and keep your head on straight.
Just be yourself say what's on your mind just be yourself.

Put it on the line just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it.
Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

You've got to get your nerve up
Your nerve up
Your nerve up [repeat]

// Flirt //

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt
Yeah
Oh, yeah

Everyday is something new with you
Give me time and I'll know what to do
You're so frisky, love your style
Can I play with you a while?

Know you much better
It's not an easy thing to do
Such a flirt, yes you are
A gem of your style

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah

So, you like body too, you say
It looks good in the mirror when you stay
Very chic yet so unique
From yours head down to your feet

We know you much better
Its not what you say or what you do
Your shapely breast gives you flesh
That seems to be your style

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah

Flirt, flirt, flirt, flirt, yeah

// Alligator Woman //

Come On!

You can feel her coming, coming at you
she, she's staying on you, you know she's coming at you.
To resist her seems impossible, 
you can't do it, no you cant do it, no you can't do it.
Hey lady what you say, how about some fun today? 
Is it yes? Is it no? 
Whatever it is just let me know, don't fake me out. Out!
Oh you make me shout!

Alligator woman, you don't care!
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair!
You just want to tease me, and turn me on.
I wish you would leave but I don't want to be alone, No!

Hey, babe I love you so, you know I don't want to go,
even though you're real laid back.
You're dressed in black! And your hair is laid back.
Hey lady what you say, how about some fun today? 
Is it yes? Is it no? 
Whatever it is just let me know, don't fake me out. Out!
Oh you make me shout!

Alligator woman, you don't care!
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair!
You just want to tease me, and turn me on.
I want you to go but I don't want to be alone, ho!

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got.
Your big behind, it makes me blind, 
Don't take me gross, but you're the most.
You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got.
Your big behind, it makes me blind, 
I must be gross.

[Laughter]
Aw girl, aw girl
[Laughter]
Aw girl, aw girl

Alligator woman, you don't care!
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair!
You just want to tease me, and turn me on.
I don't want you to stay but I don't want to be alone, now!

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got.
Your big behind, it makes me blind, 
Don't take me gross, but you're the most.
You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got.
Your big behind, it makes me blind, 
I must be gross.

// For You //

Through all my phasing times
There was a phase to separate
The heavens from the other place (and)
The feelings all inside, can't express the
Joy you bring so this my love is why
I sing for you, for you
I sing this song for you (I sing this song, ah ah), for you
For You ooooo

With all that we've been through
No one can say that we have changed
The love we had it still remains (and)
With that you filled my life
(A kiss from me is not enough, ah ah)
A kiss from me is not enough to show you that I'm living just
For you, it's true
I'm living just for you (I'm living just, ah ah), for you
For You ooo

You're the meaning in my life
(For You) For you (All things I would do) I would do
In all the many ways to show my love for you
This is one I thought I'd do (This is one I'd do, ah) Yeah hey

(I'd sing this song for you and me)
For you (I'd sing this song for you)
I'd sing this song for you baby
(I'd sing this song for you and me, I'd sing this song for you)
For You ooo, For you ooo!
