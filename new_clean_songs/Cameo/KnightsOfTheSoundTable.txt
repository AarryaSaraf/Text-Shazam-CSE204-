// Knights By Nights //

Knights, knights, knights, knights
Knights, knights, knights, knights

Please don't think we're crazy
If you see us walk and talk
(I can dig it)
We're the knights and we know this
And we take things as they come, oh, yeah

We are the knights by nights
(I'm a knight)
And we can make things right
(We can make it right)
Sending love to all our friends
(All our friends)
Stay with you till the end, alright

Knights by nights
(Knights by nights)
Knights by nights
(I'm walkin' tall)
Knights by nights
(Knights by nights)
Knights by nights

What you say?
Come on, knights

So few say you can dig it
But do you really understand
We're dedicated to the rhythm for your nation
But every person must be tall, be strong

We are the knights by nights
And we can make things right
(We can make it right)
Sending love to all our friends
(All our friends)
Stay with you till the end

Knights by nights
(We are the knights)
Knights by nights
Knights by nights
(Hey, hey, knights)
Knights by nights

Knights by nights
(Spreadin' love across the land)
Knights by nights
(We are the knights)
Knights by nights
(Knights, knights by nights)
Knights by nights

Hey, what you say? Hey

Knights by nights
(Hey, hey, knights)
Knights by nights
(We are the knights)
Knights by nights
(Knights by nights)
Knights by nights

Knights by nights
Knights by nights
(We are the knight)
Knights by nights
(Knights by night)
Knights by nights
(Knights)

// Freaky Dancin' //

People who listen for the best sound in the groove
We know we got the music that makes your body move
We like to dance, shake a booty now and then
But you got to have the right moves to impress all your friends

Just move a little freaky, go real slow, take your time
You've got to give your best to be right all the time
If you dance with me and you like just what you see
Then I know you'll have this next one with me

'Cause we all love freaky dancin' and romancin'
Let's do it some more
You can't fail once you're freakin'
So, shake your pants and we'll party for sure
We'll party for sure

In order to move like this
Yes, you gotta have confidence
Tell everybody that they'll have to wait
For the nation to participate

You ready? New York, freaky dancin'
L. A. freaky dancin'
Atlanta, freaky dancin'
Cincinnati, freaky dancin'

Shy Town, freaky dancin'

Let's do it some more, let's do it some more
You can't fail once you're freakin'
So, shake your pants and we'll party for sure
We'll party for sure

Freaky deaky
Oh, no, no, no

If there's some places that you think we missed
How can you say that with a groove like this
The other places are just waiting to break
Just bring it on on, baby rock and shake

You can't fail once you're freakin', my time to freak
So, shake your pants and we'll party for sure
We'll party for sure

Come on, come on, come on, come on

// Use It Or Lose It //

You say you don't waste your time
And you like to get down to the bottom line
And since you don't waste your time
Please stop wastin' mine

'Cause I know just what I want
And I'm afraid to sit and talk
About the things we used to say
To each other day to day

You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
(You need to know)
I think it's time for you to go but before you do
I think there's something you should know

If you don't use it
(Don't use it)
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(You can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
(My love to you)
And I want to
(Yee-hee)
And I'll take my chances
'Cause that's the way that life is

You know how funny life can be
I take a little from you, you take a little from me
I gave you love that you can't deny
Even up to here, I always try

Because I loved you, I loved you
Gave you all I had
Now you can stick it
Girl, that's too bad

A love like ours don't grow on trees
But you didn't listen and now you see

You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
I think it's time for you to go
(For you to go)
But before you do, I think there's something you should know

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
(I'm givin' my love)
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(Take my chances)

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(And I'll take my chances)

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances

// Don't Be So Cool //

Honey butter, what do you mean who am I?
My father is one of the riches men in this country
He is a member of Who's Who
I wear Gucci, Poucci and Via Ruche, just for fun that is

I have played with Xenon and beyond
I have a town house and a chalet next to the Earl
You know, Earl the Pearl Monroe
Yes, well I had a Mercedes just like his
I think it's beige and brown or, or was it the other one
The one that we take into town

Yes, sir, pretty lady, I can't take much more of this
We've been talking for an hour, I'm so dizzy I can't think
It seems the only subject I know much about is you
Well, I hate to disappoint you but I got things to do

Don't laugh, it ain't funny that I spent most of my money
And my glasses is getting soggy in my hand
I thought a bad girl like you would have some better things to do
To make a person think you are a creep

(Don't be so cool)
It's not how you style your hair
(Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

(Don't be so cool)
Let it all hang out
(Don't be so cool)
It's not what it's really about

Get back
I don't wanna hear it
I'm gone
I don't wanna hear it

What do you mean that's a nice boat?
My dear, that is a yacht
Are you coming to my party?
Well, if you don't you know your name
Isn't going to mean what it did last year
Oh, yes, I am a city rocker
Trained by Frankie Crocker

Hi di, hi di, hi, hi di, hi di, ho
Where you got your character, I don't need to go
I met a lot of people and I know one thing for sure
If you want to make it you got to be boring

(Don't be so cool)
It's not how you style your hair
(Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

(Don't be so cool)
Let it all hang out
(Don't be so cool)
It's not what it's really about

Get back
I don't wanna hear it
I'm gone
I don't wanna hear it

(Don't be so cool)
It's not how you style your hair
(Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

(Don't be so cool)
Let it all hang out
(Don't be so cool)
It's not what it's really about

(Don't be so cool)
It's not how you style your hair
(Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

(Don't be so cool)
Let it all hang out
(Don't be so cool)
It's not what it's really about

// I'll Always Stay //

We played
Those games
And no one never wins, girl, yeah
Seeing all kinds of girls
Causing heartache
Never knowing
Who's to blame
But I know it's worth what we've been through 
Because 
I'm so glad to be a part of you

Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You always come through
No matter what you do
Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You're my everything

Listen to me, girl
You're always there 
When I need someone
To talk to
You're giving me more love 
Everytime
We shared our dreams
And now our dreams are realities
The whole wide world is out there
Waiting for you and me
But I know it's worth what we've been through
Because
I'm so glad to be in love with you

Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You always come through
No matter what you do
Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You're my everything (everything)

Yeah, you know girl
Sometimes when I'm alone
I often wonder about the good things in my life
And I seem to realize 
What a lucky man I am
To have someone 
As special as you are

Someone to care for me
Feel for me
Hold me and touch me and love love love love me

Some people go through life
Without ever finding that special someone for them
But I have
And it's you
And it's you
You
I'm talking about you baby

I don't never ever want to stop loving you
Feeling for you
Caring about you
