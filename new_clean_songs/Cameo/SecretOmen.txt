// Find My Way //

Find my way
I must leave you, try to find my way
I can't take it, love, another day
Please don't stop me
Let me go and find my way

You got me so uptight
You keep saying that I'm wrong
When I'm right and you do it just for spite
I think you're out to break my poor heart
I am gonna stop you before you start

And those games you play
Those are silly little games to play
If you carry on, then please just stay away
I won't give myself to you, not one more day

I've got to make that break
Can't put me through changes
That I just can't take
'Cause I don't get what you're saying

You say you love me, that's no guarantee
When we're together a star hits the sea
And it strikes a tree, please let me go free

Hey, hey

Find my way, find my way
Find my way, find my way
Find my way, find my way
Find my way, find my way

// Energy //

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy

Ain't nothing wrong with disco
It goes along with the funk
If you don't like it don't get mad at us
You say you just can't stand my music
Can't you see, yeah
The music's got a certain energy

That disco music makes me feel alive
That funky music makes me do my jive
It takes me so high I just can't see, yeah
That music always gets the best of me, huh

Get up (move, move)
Get up (move, move)
Come on, get down (move, move)
Just do it (move, move)

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy

It makes me do just what I want to do with you
It relaxes me the way I like to relax too
For any problem it's a remedy, yeah
Just thank the Lord for all that energy, huh

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy

Get up and get down (move, move)
Come on
Move it, move it
Get up (move, move)
Move it, rock it (move, move)
Come on, come on (move, move)

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy

// I Just Want To Be //

Pleasure is my thing, I want to tell you. 
I'll do what you want me to, or I'll do nothing at all!

I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
A get me hot and see what you want me to be.  

If you want me to, I'll do it.
If you want to dance lets get to it.
Let's not take too long let's move it.
Cause if you take too long, you lose it.    

Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
It wasn't me but maybe it was you.         

Music is here for everyone.
Just to dance just to have some fun.
Just because, we did it before.
Doesn't mean we can't have some more.   

I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be. 

Play my music loud I'll do my dance for you.
Cause when the music's pumping its hard to tell what we're gonna do.
If you think you can we'll dance to death all night.
Cause the pleasure I can give will make things turn out right.

If you want me to, I'll do it.
If you want to dance lets get to it.
Let's not take too long let's move it.
Cause if you take too long, you lose it.    

Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
It wasn't me but maybe it was you.

Just to dance just to have some fun.
Just because, we did it before.
Doesn't mean we can't have some more.   

I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be. 

Music will make things turn out right 
And I will dance till the broad day light 
Feel my body fulfill your needs
Cause I know you're hungry
And I'm here to please
Alright, alright, alright, alright!

I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
I'll be your freaky deak if you want me to be.

// Macho //

Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho

You say you think you wanna be macho
You say your life will never run down
Ya gotta have that feeling about you
To be funky and really get down
Hey man keep a stiff upper lip
Who said that life was easy why don't you get hip
You never know what's in store for you
Can't beat 'em then join 'em then here's what you do

Stretch out!
Stretch out!

A lesson in macho it goes just like this
Jump up and down and ball up your fists
And say I I I like to dance
Just watch me move
And say oo la oo la oo la oo la
Say it again oo la oo la oo la oo la
Just let me rock

// The Rock //

Get down, get down
Well well

Don't stop cause we like the way you move
If you feel the funk like we do clap your hands

Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock

Everybody gather 'round, I think I found a new dance
And it don't move on my way
I dug a lot of people going left right left right
I've gotten dizzy from the rhythm which they sway
I asked a lady in the corner what's this dance she's doin'

You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock

Left right left right

Do the rock, do the rock
Do the rock, do the rock
Do the rock, do the rock

Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock

Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock

// Sparkle //

Oohhoo 
When I first saw you 
You had sparkle in your eye 
Like the starts at night 
High in the sky 

How I wish 
That you were mine 
'Cause to me 
You're one of a kind 

When I look at you 
It seems so untrue 
How someone like you 
Can make me feel the way you do 

Sparkle in your eye (I) 
Sparkle in your eye (I see that sparkle in your eye) 
Sparkle in your eye (Ohohohwhoaha) 

You're so fine 
For all the world to see 
I find you hard to believe, you see 
(You're so beautiful, yeah, yeah) 
You make me want to love you (Yeah, yeah) 
Oohhoo 

When I look at you (When I look at you) 
It seems so untrue 
How someone just like you 

Your eye 
Sparkle in your eye (When I look at you I see) 
Sparkle in your eye (Heyheyheyyeah) 

Ha 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha (Ah, ha) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha (Ah, ha) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Sparkle, sparkle) 

(Baby, baby) Sparkle in your eye (Baby, baby) 
Sparkle in your eye (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
Sparkle in your eye (Ow, ow, baby)

// New York //

New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

Go ride, go ride
Don't feel uptight
Go right, go left
There's no place else
New York's a place
A special place
With art all around
The best around

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

Disco all night
Your taste delight
Broadway the lights
All shine at night
All kinds of girls
The best in the world
Talk loud, wear new
Where who is who
All kinds of food
To fit your mood
So much to do
So just be you

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

The fashion the cash
The cars the bars
Fashions are new
Made just for you
You'll find a star
And won't look far
Maybe you'll see
Miss Liberty
Wall Street is there
In all you'll stare
So much to see
For you and me

New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York
