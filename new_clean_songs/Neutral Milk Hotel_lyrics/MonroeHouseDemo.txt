// Circle Of Friends //

Greet all your friends and they say hello
They tie all your ends until they tie
Yourself in again into something whole
Something secure and lost inside

And climb away

All of the forces we uphold
And all of the dangers we escape
You wonder sometimes how long we'll hold
Till all of this anger shows its way

And breaks

Away
I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay

There are just some things we can't know
There are just some things you can't face
But I will secure myself and blow
Against this disease that you embrace

And waste away

And beginning again takes so much time
And all of your friends come to watch you go
And as your machine pulls from the drive
You watch as their empty hearts explode

And blow

Away
Away
I'm okay
I'm okay

// Jennifer //

I bring Jennifer flowers
I bring Jennifer cupcakes
I bring Jennifer snow cones
I bring Jennifer yard rakes
And we dance in the leaves
That go up to our knees
And I cough and I sneeze
Only for Jennifer

I bring Jennifer wine
I bring Jennifer apple peels
For that's all that she needs for a good time
And we put on our pants
And we sing and we dance
As the sun wanders past
Above me and Jennifer

I bring Jennifer sailboats
And Jennifer brings me the sky
We swim through a sea of artichokes
Awaiting the day we'll die
And the trumpets will blow
And the water will flow
And a flower will grow
Above me and Jennifer

Jennifer
Jennifer

// Going Down //

I crushed the world I was in
I'll destroy the world I will find
I'll work the tools with my hands
I'll stick the needles in my eyes

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down

Bring down the sky with my tears
Dig up the earth with my hands
Take a look inside of my head
Maybe then you could understand

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down

So long, again my friend
I guess its time I let you know
These things, they come around
I guess they just get hard to let them go
You wait around while
You'll never seem to find that faith in me
You close your eyes and smile
Forever I will be

I know the way and I will go
I know the way and I will find
It's all around me, and I told you so
It around and hear goodbye (All around in here, goodbye)

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down
And all the big decisions
We never could decide
And now I'm going down

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down

// Arms So Real //

Folded in to arms, so real (or I hold it into arms so real)
There is something that we can't feel
Life's not horrible all the time

Smokes and cups and words of rhyme
Dripping ceiling, lemon-lime
I love you, and that's all I have to say

Eyes of gray and pavement green
Wrap your arms around the seam
Take your love and hold it close
Just slightest suggestion

Eyes of gray and pavement green
Wrap your arms around the seam
Take your love and hold it close
Just slightest suggestion

Spinning slightly 'round
My head hits the ground
A seed pops out
Glows the thought, then (or Globes of thought, then)
Descends the thought to you, with love
With love
With love

// Gardenhead //

There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name

// Smile For Me //

When there's no one else around
And the world just brings you down
And the sun starts turning black
And Nelson's head is in a sack

Won't you smile for me?
Won't you smile for me?

When balloon just blows up
And your teeth are in a cup
And the drugs you bought don't high
And you only want to die

Won't you smile for me?
Won't you smile for me?

If the times just make you spit
And your world is full of shit
Turn your gray eyes to blue
And let me have one last look at you

And smile for me
Won't you smile for me?

Come on, smile
Come on, smile
Come on, smile
Yeah, come on, smile

// Sleepytime //

Go to sleep my darling
Go to sleep my dear
It's late in the evening
And sleepy time is drawing near
My mind is growing tired
From December rains and winds
So let's sleep by the fire of orange apple cinnamon

Yes, I know it's hard to wait so long
And you will be waiting
Oh, it's true
The dead dog will reveal himself to you

The dead dog will save us all
The dead dog will save us all
The dead dog will save us all
The dead dog will save us all

// Say Goodnight //

Say goodnight
Like a ship at sea
And walk away
From a world that does not believe
Say- say goodnight
And open up your arms
It's a beautiful life
And I'm sitting in a jar
So what was me, I do believe
That my pants are all rolled up
And I think it's time
I gave up my sanity

Good and good for ya, 'cause it's made with milk
