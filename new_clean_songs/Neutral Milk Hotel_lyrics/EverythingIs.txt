Album: EverythingIs

// Tuesday Moon //

Your love is like a building
Pushing up towards the sky
I just wanna climb your tower
To your dress like apple pie

Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Vegetable hand on my perfume

I am changing colors daily
Jumping to my postbox
While everything's exploding baby
In your dress I'll sleep a while

Oh its flying toward some Tuesday
Oh its flying toward some Tuesday moon
Into the air like a balloon
She's taking scissors to her wing
It's shrinking diesel through my room
With no arms and legs, can you dig?
Can you dig it?

Your love is like a drunken stuper
Falling into push paper holes
Into my insides I scoop her
Burning up her real time flows

Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Vegetable hand on my perfume
Vegetable hand on my perfume
Vegetable hand on my perfume

// Everything Is //

Growing sleepy as the rain falls 
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
As night falls into dust and it's day again 

I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream 
Old men with kazoos and beating drums 
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream 
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun 

Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading 

Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile 
We could close the door and sleep all day 
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind 
That's lost its feeling of so afraid 

Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading 

Grown sleepy now as the rain falls 
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
As night falls into dust and it's day again 

Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading

// Here We Are //

Here we are, a final moment
Found inside a wood guitar
That splits the seams wide open
But oh, 'cause I know who you are
You paint the doors and walls
And listen for the bell-chime calls
And life is nothing more at all
Than tea-cup drips and bouncing balls
And oh, it's real and never fading
I'll listen to the strings you strum
And all the words you're saying now

Oh, sing a song, a song with feeling
That sounds best when you've hit the bong
And concludes a deeper meaning
But oh, because I know sometimes
All the thoughts can sometimes hit
Confusion as the record skips
But who needs fools to think you're hip
When all the world is full of shit
And oh, I hear the tunes you're playing
It splits inside the summer sky
It's softly cascading on

// Unborn //

A candy coated dream
With parks and trees and figurines
And her arms wrap round my sleeve
With tiny steps and eyes of green
Toy guitar that's out of tune
Eyes fixed on morning time cartoons
And by the lantern of the moon
I will dream of a love like you

And will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child
As she is dancing now?
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now

A candy coated dream 
With hearts and string and angel wings
And her life will fall between
The cracks that follow you and me

Will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child
As she is dancing now?
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now

// Snow Song //

One, two, three..

Cindy smiles
And overcoats
She says, "Please stay a while!"
Like ice cream floats and dreams
And I will fill you heart
With boats and bills and beams and candy-appled everythings
Bills and beams and candy-appled everythings

Cindy skips my trampoline
With toys and horns and bouncing things
And even the most silent must sing a song of love
Yes even the silent, they must sing a song of love

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

A happy girl, she's spinning
These strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning
Of a trip around the world
Cindy, won't you smile?
Cindy, won't you sleep a while?
I feel like just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

Rain...
Rain is a perfectly sculpted garden of wetness

// Ruby Bulbs //

I need to taste your voice in my mouth
I need to taste your voice in the air
And I need to feel your skin against all that I retch out
And feel your voice all over everywhere

I need to paste your skin around the mailbox
And hold the postman in your smile
I need to fill your lungs with smallpox
And fill the glow of a sick and distorted life

Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful babies
All filled with angels

We are wrecking in your over
We are swimming in your speakers
We are sticky stuff all over
Coming out from all your features
For free
And I say I want inside you
Because there's nothing on the surface
But it hurts to have to hold you
And all your holes they hold no purpose
For me
