Album: Reckoning

// Harborcoat //

They crowded up to Lenin with the noses worn off
My handshake is worthy, it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "react"

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
Then we ditched the books but the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said, oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it

They crowded up to Lenin with the noses worn off
A handshake is worthy, if it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "react" R.E.A.C.T.

Oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
Then we ditched the books but the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said, oh, please find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat
Can't go outside without it

// Seven Chinese Brothers //

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a seat
Take in one symphony now, we've just begun to battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waited hold it to you in the colored come another

Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain
She will return, she will return

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a seat
Take in one symphony now, we've just begun to battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waded seven seas swimming colored come another

Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain
She will return, she will return

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy, woman offers pull up a chair
Take in one symphony now, I guess we lost that battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel, turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waded seven seas swimming colored come another

Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years the Communi did reign
She will return, she will return

// So. Central Rain //

Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The trees will bend, the cities wash away
The city on the river there is a girl without a dream
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Eastern to Mountain, third party call, the lines are down
The wise man built his words upon the rocks
But I'm not bound to follow suit
The trees will bend, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another home, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The ocean sang, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another dream, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

// Pretty Persuasion //

It's what I want, hurry and buy
All has been tried, follow reason and buy

Cannot shuffle in this heat, it's all wrong
Try to put that on your sleeve it's all wrong, it's all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's what I want, hurry and buy
All has been tried, follow reasoning

And I put that in this heat, it's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong, all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the light I saw quite a scene in there

It's what I want, hurry and buy
all has been tried, follow reason and buy

Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong, all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persua...

// Time After Time (AnnElise) //

Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
If your friends took a fall, are your obligated to follow
Time after time after time

When the bull's on his hooves, when you gather friends by the tower
If you try to refuse, will they judge your worth by the hour
Time after time after time, time after time after time

If you're tired and you've tried you can find me in my room
You can stay if you want but the third time you can't lose
Time after time after time, time after time after time

Ask the girl of the hour by the water tower's watch
We can fight if you want but who will turn out the lights
Time after time after time, time after time after time
Time after time after time, time after time after time

// Second Guessing //

Why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season
Who will be your book this season

Oh, why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
Who will be your look this season
Who will be your book this season

Oh, here we are

Why are you trying to second guess me
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season
Be in my club, write a book this season

Oh, here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are

// Letter Never Sent //

It's been pretty simple so far
Vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood
I thought I'd left you behind

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live

I followed the catacombs
Left my soul at home
This letter never sent
And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
When I'm moving too fast
Here's my new address

The water's receiving me now
The catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone
No, not, not so dark, dark
And it's so far, it's so dark, I'm so lost
And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far

Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
Heaven is yours, heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live
(Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)

// Camera //

From the inside room when the front room greeting 
Becomes your special book, it was simple then
When the party lulls, if we fall by the side
Will you be remembered, will she be remembered

Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face

I fell by your bed once, I didn't want to tell you
I should keep myself in between the pages
Of the green light room, if we fall by the side
Will you be remembered, will she be remembered

Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face

From the inside room when the front room greeting 
Becomes your special book, it was simple then
When the party lulls, if we fall by the side
I still like you, can you remember

Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face
Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face

// (Don't Go Back To) Rockville //

Looking at your watch a third time
Waiting in the station for the bus
Going to a place that's far
So far away and if that's not enough
Going where nobody says hello
They don't talk to anybody they don't know

You'll wind up in some factory
That's full-time filth and nowhere left to go
Walk home to an empty house
Sit around all by yourself
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

At night I drink myself to sleep
And pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

It's not as though I really need you
If you were here I'd only bleed you
But everybody else in town only wants
To bring you down and that's not how it ought to be
I know it might sound strange, but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year
Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

// Little America //

I can't see myself at thirty, I don't buy a lacquered thirty
Caught like flies, preserved for tomorrow's jewelry, again
Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Preserved for tomorrow's eyes, in a tree beer tar-black br'er sap

The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest
The consul a horse, Jefferson, I think we're lost

Who will tend the farm museums, who will dust today's belongings
Who will sweep the floor, hedging near the givens
Rally round your leaders it's the mediator season
Diane is on the beach, do you realize the life she's led

The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest
The consul a horse, oh man, I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest
A matter of course, Jefferson, drive

Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Skylight, sty-tied, Nero pie-tied, in a tree tar-black br'er sap
Reason has harnessed the tame, a lodging, not stockader's game
Another Greenville, another Magic Mart, Jeffer, grab your fiddle

The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest
The consul a horse, Jefferson, I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest
The consul a horse, Jefferson, I think we're lost, lost

// Moon River //

Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
You dream maker
You heart-breaker
Wherever you're going
I'm going your way

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waitin' round the bend
My Huckleberry friend
Moon River and me
