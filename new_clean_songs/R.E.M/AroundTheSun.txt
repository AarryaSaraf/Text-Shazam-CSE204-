// Leaving New York //

It's quiet now

And what it brings

Is everything


Comes calling back

A brilliant night

I'm still awake


I looked ahead

I'm sure I saw you there


You don't need me

To tell you now

That nothing can compare


You might have laughed if I told you

You might have hidden A frown

You might have succeeded in changing me

I might have been turned around


It's easier to leave than to be left behind

Leaving was never my proud

Leaving New York, never easy

I saw the light fading out


Now life is sweet

And what it brings

I tried to take

But loneliness

It wears me out

It lies in wait


And I've lost

Still in my eyes

The shadow of necklace

Across your thigh

I might've lived my life in a dream, but I swear

This is real

Memory fuses and shatters like glass

Mercurial future, forget the past

It's you, it's what I feel.


You might have laughed if I told you (it's pulling me apart)

You might have hidden a frown (change)

You might have succeeded in changing me (it's pulling me apart)

I might have been turned around (change)


It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)

Leaving was never my proud (change)

Leaving New York, never easy (it's pulling me apart)

I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart

You find it in your heart, change...


I told you, forever

I love you, forever

I told you, I love you

I love you, forever

I told you, forever

You never, you never

You told me forever


You might have laughed if I told you

You might have hidden the frown

You might have succeeded in changing me

I might have been turned around


It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)

Leaving was never my proud (change)

Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)

I saw the life fading out (change)

Leaving New York, never easy (it's pulling me apart)

I saw the light fading out (change)

Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)

I saw the life fading out (change)

// Electron Blue //

You're on your ear, the ocean's near

The light has started to fade

Your high is timed, you found the climb

It's hard to focus on more than what's in front of you

Electron Blue

Adventure rings with a page and

When it dawns on you,

It singes blue 

Your buzz beginning to wane.


Adventure has laid its claim on you

It's all you want to do.

You

You know where to run

You run Electron Blue.


And who am I?

I'm just a guy

I've got a story like everyone

But in your eyes

You looked surprised

And didn't know where to run

I looked to her

She's found the cure

Her future's already begun


Tomorrow's gaining speed on you

It's all you want to do

You

You know where to run

You run Electron Blue

You

You know where to run

You run electron blue


So bide your time

You'll feel the climb

Your high it builds like a lightning storm

It sings like pearls

You know that girl

And no one is any the wiser

So as if on cue.....

Electron Blue


Tomorrow's gaining speed on you

It's all you want to do

You

You know where to run

You run, Electron Blue

You

You know where to run

You run, Electron Blue

You

You know where to run

You run, Electron Blue

// The Outsiders //

You took me to the restaurant where we first met

You knocked a future shock crowbar upside my head

I got caught with the stop of the tick-tock, tick-tock clock

When you told me what you knew


Lost in the moment

The day that the music stopped

And I do remember you


Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth

Promising volcanic change of plot

Where will this lead us - I'm scared of the storm

The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born


I tried to tell you I am not afraid

You looked up and saw it all across my face

So am I with you or am I against

I don't think it's that easy - we're lost in regret


Now I'm trying to remember

The feeling when the music stopped

When you told me what you knew


Lost in the moment

The day that the music stopped

And I do remember you


Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth

Promising volcanic change of plot

Where does this leave us - I'm scared of the storm

The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born


Drawing patterns with a cork on the tablecloth

Promising volcanic change of plot

Where does this leave us - I'm scared of the storm

The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born


The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born

The outsiders are gathering


A man walks away when every muscle says to stay

How many yesterdays - they each weigh heavy

Who says what changes may come?

Who says what we call home?

I know you see right through me, my luminescence fades

The dusk provides an antidote, I am not afraid

I've been a million times in my mind

This is really just a technicality, frailty, reality


Uh, it's time to breathe, time to believe

Let it go and run towards the sea

They don't teach that, they don't know what you mean

They don't understand, they don't know what you mean

They don't get it, I wanna scream

I wanna breathe again, I wanna dream

I wanna float a quote from Martin Luther King

I am not afraid

I am not afraid

I am not afraid


I am not afraid

I am not afraid

I am not afraid

I am not afraid

// Make It All Ok //

You threw away the ballast and you rowed your boat ashore

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?

You made your ultimatum too big to ignore

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?


So you worked out your excuses, 

turned away and shut the door.

The world's too vast for us now, 

and you wanted to explore 


It's a long, long long road

And I don't know which way to go

If you offered me your hand again I'd have to walk away.


When I saw you at the street fair, you called out my name

Didn't you, now? Didn't you? 

You said we could start over, try and make it all okay.

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?


So our past has been rewritten 

and you threw away the pen.

You'd said that I was useless, 

but now you'll take me in again


Well Jesus loves me fine.

And your words fall flat this time.


Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,

"We don't have a prayer between us."


Didn't you believe that I have finally turned away?

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?

Anything to hold onto to help me through my day.

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?


Jesus loves me fine.

But his words fall flat this time.


It's a long, long long road

And I don't know which way to go

If you offered me your world, did you think I'd really stay?

If you offered me the heavens, I would have to turn away.

Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,

"We don't have a prayer between us." 

Didn't you, now? Didn't you, now?

Didn't you?

// Final Straw //

As I raise my head to broadcast my objection

As your latest triumph draws the final straw

Who died and lifted you up to perfection?

And what silenced me is written into law.


I can't believe where circumstance has thrown me

And I turn my head away

If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.

Not again. not today. not today.


If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow

And forgiveness takes a back seat to revenge

There's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected.

There's a voice in me that says you will not win. 


And if I ignore the voice inside,

Raise a half glass to my home.

But it's there that I am most afraid,

And forgetting doesn't hold. it doesn't hold.


Now I don't believe and I never did

That two wrongs make a right.

If the world were filled with the likes of you

Then I'm putting up a fight. I'm putting up a fight.

Putting up a fight. make it right. make it right. 


Now love cannot be called into question.

Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.

And love- love will be my strongest weapon.

I do believe that I am not alone.


For this fear will not destroy me.

And the tears that have been shed

It's knowing now where I am weakest

And the voice in my head. in my head.


Then I raise my voice up higher

And I look you in the eye

And I offer love with one condition.

With conviction, tell me why.

Tell me why.

Tell me why.

Look me in the eye. 

Tell me why.

// I Wanted To Be Wrong //

You know where I come from

You know what I feel

You're Yul Brenner Westworld

Reporting from the field.

I threw it into reverse,

Made a motion to repeal.

You kicked my legs from under me,

And tried to take the wheel.


I told you I wanted to be wrong, 

But everyone is humming a song

That I don't understand.


Now I know that the sun has shined on my side of the street. 

The basket of America, the weevils and the wheat.

The milk and honeyed congregation, scrubbed and apple-cheeked

Salute Apollo 13 from the rattle jewelry seats.


Mythology's seductive and it turned a trick on me

That I have just begun to understand.


I told you I wanted to be wrong, 

But everyone is humming a song

That I don't understand. 


The rodeo is staged, gold circle goat-ropers and clowns. 

A rumble in the third act, tie 'em up and burn 'em down. 

We're armed to the teeth, born a little breech; 

Blue-plate special analysts, cells and SUV's


We can't approach the Allies 'cause they seem a little peeved

And speak a language we don't understand. 


I told you I wanted to be wrong

But everyone is humming a song 

That I don't understand.


(Prop up The Omega Man, we're primed for victory, 

God gave us the upper hand, there's honor among thieves.

Temper it with arrogance, a dash of sad conceit.

The top's down on the T-Bird, we're the children of the free)


Storm into the boardroom of the conquering elite.

Did you recognize the madman who is shouting in the streets? 

Destroy the things that I don't understand

Destroy the things that I don't understand.

// Wanderlust //

Looks like I pulled a fast one

Looks like I went to town

Looks like the world revolves around me

Looks like it's falling down.


I thought I'd kicked the traces

I thought the wheels would spin

I thought I'd jumped the fence and bolted

Looks like I'm back again


I got my signals crossed.

It's overwhelming because

I'm all alone and I can't get back

Get back with my wanderlust.


I had to grab a suitcase

I had to change my clothes

I had to run the shower hot 

until the water froze


I brushed against confusion

I wanted time to grow

I want the sticks and stones not to throw me 

get back to what I know 


I got my signals crossed.

It's overwhelming because

I'm all alone and I can't get back

Get back with my wanderlust.


I'm searching for a greatness

I smear it on my face

I want to bathe in grape must 

swim the length of the milky way

I want it to be brilliant

I want it to be sweet

I want to kiss the astronauts 

when they salute to me me me me


I got my signals crossed.

It's overwhelming because

I'm all alone and I can't get back

Get back with my wanderlust.


I got my signals crossed.

It's overwhelming because

I'm all alone and I can't get back

Get back with my wanderlust.

// Boy In The Well //

Look at this, it's me, walking away
Look at you drowning, on display
Every time I've dropped by, I've tried to say
The water is rising
You don't want to stay

It's that sinking feeling. you know what it's bringing on
You might as well say it
I see it, I feel it
This town is going wrong
It's turning away

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful
I'd like for them to take me on

The track mall gang went off
On the Tennessee goth. a lunar moth
You chrysalis and flail
The water is rising. you try to rappel
A rousing cheer for the boy in the well

It's that sinking feeling. you know what it's bringing on
You might as well say it
I see it, I feel it
This town is going wrong
It's turning away

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful
I'd like for them to take me on

Here is where I look back
Here is where you fell
This is where I got up
Shaking off my tail
This is where your rope trick
Started to look stale
A greyhound pass for the boy in the well

It's that sinking feeling
You know what it's bringing on
I might as well say it
I see it, I feel it
This town is going wrong
It's turning away

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful
I'd like for them to take me on

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful
I'd like for them to take me on

// Aftermath //

Now the radio stutters. snaps to life.

Some sour song that sets it right.

And when London falls

He'd like to call

But the stars collide.

They're beautiful and much maligned.

In a universe where you see the worst,

And it's up to you to fix it.


Now you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you want to shout

How you see it all


It's easy to dismiss the "what's it all about" crowd.

There is no doubt. it's this, here, now.

And you close your eyes.

He's not coming back.

So you work it out, overfeed the cat.

And the plants are dry and they need to drink.

So you do your best. and you flood the sink.

Sit down in the kitchen and cry.


Now you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you want to shout

How you see it all


Now the universe left you for a runners lap.

It feels like home when it comes crashing back.

And it makes you laugh

And it makes you cry,

When London falls

And you're still alive.

The radio stutters,

It makes you laugh

And the aftermath,

Open up your eyes.

You're so alive.


Now you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you've worked it out

And you see it all

And you want to shout

How you see it all

How you've worked it out

And you see it all

How you've worked it out

And you see it all

// High Speed Train //

When I look into your eyes.

Your drop like an anchor eyes.

I scudded and clipped the sky

Just shy of making it.


And you almost got away.

I told you I was afraid.

Did I really want to try 

You're holding me to my claim


I jump on a high speed train

I'll never look back again

I flail like the antelope

Who jumped from the building


and you caught me on the sly

you've taken me by surprise.

you've mirrored my best disguise and 

turned it back on me. 


I jump on a high speed train

I'll never look back again

I flail like the antelope

Who jumped from the building


I jump on a high speed train

I'll never look back again

To Berlin, Kyoto or Marseilles

I'd go anywhere for you


I'll bring you a big bouquet

I picked it myself today

it compliments your eyes

there's love at the end of the line


I jump on a high speed train

I'll never look back again

I flail like the antelope

Who jumped from the building


I jump on a high speed train

I'll never look back again

To Berlin, Kyoto or Marseilles

I'd go anywhere for you


And that's what I always knew

I'd like to have hung the moon.

I'd wrestle you for a spoon inside your sleeping bag.

Just us. 


No war. no hate. no past.

It's real. 

I'm here. I'm yours. I'm fast.

I'm long in the eye

I'm cry when I try 

I just want to fly

Just you and I, together

// The Worst Joke Ever //

You see there's this cat burglar who can't see in the dark.

He lays his bets on 8 more lives, walks into a bar.

Slips on the 8 ball, falls on his knife.

Says, "I don't know what I've done, but it doesn't feel right!"


Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime,

When's the first time you heard that one, 1954?

Get to the punch line. fall to the floor. 


Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for

The worst joke ever, I never

I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story

Don't bore me


Now I am floating,

I feel released.

The moorings have been dropped, 

The weights unleashed.

Everything is crystalline, simple and free. 


The crime of good men who can't wrestle with change, 

Or are too afraid to face this life's misjudged unknowns

You're not hurting anybody else's chances,

But you're disfiguring your own. 


Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup for

The worst joke ever, I never

I'll tell you my version of the greatest life story

Don't bore me, I NEVER

Give me a minute and I'll tell you the setup


You see there's this feeling that I've heard this one before

// The Ascent Of Man //

So hesitation pulled me back

I'm stronger when I don't attract

In your eyes I'm a lamb without a rack

And I am getting confused

I'm a cactus trying to be a canoe

As you pan for ore

In the desert, floored

I say to you


That I could never imagine a place so beautiful

I could never steal your gold away.


Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...


(I try to walk like a big wham bam

I came across like a battering ram

I try to float like a telegram sam

I'm trying to divine you.)


My book is called "The Ascent Of Man"

I marked your chapter with a catamaran

The accent's off

But I am what I am


Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...


(I try to walk like a big wham bam

I came across like a battering ram

I try to float like a telegram sam

I'm trying to divine you.)


I looked for you, it's my last grandstand

A motorscootered goat legged pan

Figure eighting in quicksand ...


Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...


(I try to walk like a big wham bam

I try to float like a telegram sam

I came across like a battering ram

I'm trying to divine you.)


(I try to walk like a big wham bam

I try to float like a telegram sam

I came across like a battering ram

I'm trying to divine you.)


So hesitation pulled me back

I'm so in love I don't attract

And with my hands tied I won't crack

('Cause in my mind I called you back.)

// Around The Sun //

I want the sun to shine on me

I want the truth to set me free

I wish the followers would lead 

with a voice so strong it could knock me to my knees


Hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming

Hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off

Hold onto this boy a little longer

Take another trip around the sun


If I jumped into the ocean to believe

If I climbed a mountain would I have to reach? 

Do I even dare to speak?--to dream?--believe? 

Give me a voice so strong

I can question what I have seen


Hold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming

Hold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off

Hold onto this boy a little longer

Take another trip around the sun


Around the sun 

Around the sun

Around the sun

Let my dreams set me free.

Believe. believe. 

Now now now now now now
