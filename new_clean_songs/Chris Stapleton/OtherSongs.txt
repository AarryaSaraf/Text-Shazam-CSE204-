// Amanda //

I've held it all in, God knows I've tried
It's an awful awakening in a country boy's life
Look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
Got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm pushin' forty and I'm still wearin' jeans

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

// BLOW //

Supernatural freak

Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging, please

You red-leather rocket
You little foxy queen
Everybody's watchin'
Pretty little thing

Whipped cream and everything in-between, yeah

// I Want Love //

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough

Oh, a man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

// I'm A Ram //

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause I'm a ram, yes, I am
And I know what to do
I think I'll drive on
Tryin' to get next to you

I'm a ram, baby
You bet your life, I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause I'm a ram, yes, I am
And I'm stubborn as I can be
I'm a ram, yes I am
Now try to get next to me

I'm a ram, yeah
You bet your life I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause as a ram out in the bush
And he needs to be free
Won't somebody please
Come and see about me

I'm a ram now
You bet your life I do
'Cause I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

// Nothing Else Matters //

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know, oh

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

// Sweet Symphony //

I get weak
Whenever you're around
I let my walls down
And lay my weapons on the floor
Fight
Every day I used to fight
And dream of real love at night
Well, it's reality now

Loving you's a sweet, sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
And my heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers

Wrong
We'll get things wrong
But as long as we keep, every promise we make we'll stay whole
I know
There'll be heavy days
But in every mistake
There's a lesson to learn so stay here with me

Loving you's a sweet, sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
My heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers

Even in the valley, baby
When the river's too deep
Let me be your comfort, darling
Wherever this road leads

Loving you's a sweet symphony
That all of heaven and earth join to sing
And my heart trembles at the sound
Even if the world that we built falls at our feet
We're still right where we're supposed to be
Together through ups and the downs
Dungeons and ivory towers

// The Ballad Of The Lonesome Cowboy //

I was a lonesome cowboy
Lonesome as I could be
You came along, changed my life
And fixed what was broken in me

I was a lonesome cowboy
I didn't have a friend
Now I got friends comin' out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again

You can't be happy when you're all by yourself
Go on, tell me I'm wrong (you're wrong)
When someone takes you down from the shelf
And plays with you some, it's wonderful (wonderful)

I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
I just found out what love is about
I've never felt this way before

I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore

// The Right Ones //

Put me on a chain
You put me in a box
You put me in a cage
And you start throwin' rocks

I offer up my heart
I offer up my soul
You wanted me to dance
I just wanna rock n roll

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I waited in the rain
Pulled out all the stops
Walked out on the stage
And I played until we dropped
I tore the place apart
Let 'em all alone
I wanna take a chance, 
You wanna take it slow

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometimes
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I'm downtown
With a down crowd
Drinkin' my best not to think about you
Just a fool's hope at the end of my rope
Sitting at the bar, praying for a miracle

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

I don't know what I'm 'sposed to say sometime
Where to draw that line
You oughta know
Nobody cares if the words don't rhyme
If you say the right ones

// What Are You Listening To //

I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling, hearts still breaking
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling, hearts still breaking
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

Is it a feel good song get you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on past the past
Or the kind you can't help singing along
singing woh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Is it headphones on on a downtown train
Or the window seat on an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny or Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling, hearts still breaking
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

I put that record on - girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again
