// A Sky Like I've Never Seen //

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Water, winded, and remote
In my crater where I'm hid
I can see a line of smoke
On the other ridge
Though it's a long way

There's an ocean on the line
In it empty and it dream
There's a sun above a sky like I've never seen
A sun above a sky like I've never seen
And I need to let the sun give it meaning
This time, time, time, time

Woo woo woo ahh

And I can hear you through the stand
When I found her where I'm led
Locked in memory I ran, am I so condemned
To a mind that demands that the body rents
And am I given evidence that it might end
This time, time, time, time

Days ebb as tides
As I trace some peace
May the maze of my life
Lead me out serene

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

// In The Morning //

In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
In the morning, it's the morning of my life

And in the daytime, I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by, waiting by the ocean floor
Painting castles in the shifting sands
Pools of water, nobody understands
In the morning, it's the morning of my life

It's the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right-hand corner of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll wait until sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
For another day, it's the morning of my life

In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
For another day, it's the morning of my life
Yeah, it's the morning of my life

// Isles //

Everyone stares when you walk in the room
They stare when you go
You've got so much control
How could anyone say no?
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Caught in the light, you would idly spin
Your skeleton ring
See it shine when you sing
To the window with no meaning
From Tennessee your harmony
Would leave your spirit

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Silver the shores of isles up north
Boulevards of dancing boats

You keep the old ember burning
With meadows in mind
As the coaches go by
These thoughts of you will die
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Silver the shores of isles up north
Boulevards of dancing boats

Silver the shores of isles up north

// Silver Dagger //

Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

All men are false, says my mother
They'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies
And the very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh

My daddy, he's a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid, he's loved and wronged

So court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I've been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life

Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
