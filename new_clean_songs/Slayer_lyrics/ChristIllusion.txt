// Flesh Storm //

[Lyrics & Music: King]

Take a deep breath
'Cause it all starts now
When you pull the fuckin' pin
The shrapnel burns
As it tears into the skin
Ever wonder what it takes
To be questioning your faith
This is what it's like
When it happens every Goddamn day

Violence is our way of life

Shards of life
Like confetti in the air
The flesh storm grows
As it breeds despair
You hear screams in the distance
Fighting the resistance
Not cries of war
These are just the sounds of pain

It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless War

[Lead - Hanneman]

Killing's in style
And it's now the main event
The cameras are whores
For The daily bloodshed
Like a junkie
Hungery for a fix of anything
The media devours
And feasts upon the inhumane

Violence is our way of life

It's all too fuckin' clear
We can never coincide
So let's all drink
To genocide
All the venomous sights
Border on the arcane
In times of war
Everything is bound by pain

It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless War
Warfare knows no compassion
Thrives with no evolution
Unstable minds exacerbate
Unrest in peace

[Lead King]

There's no future
The world is dead
So save the last
Bullet for your head

Only fallen have won
Because the fallen can't run
My vision's not obscure
For war there is no cure
So here the only law
Is men killing men
For someone else's cause

It's all just psychotic devotion
Manipulated with no discretion
Relentless War

[Lyrics & Music: King]

[All Leads: King]

Attitude is my addiction
I live life with no regret
Unlike it's my conviction
That sets me apart from the rest

I live for competition
Your cynicism only makes my stronger
I am the culmination
Setting the Standard that all will follow

I live it every day
Don't know another way

Within my eyes there is devastation an fury
You can't understand
In my fight
Win by attrition I bring it with that I fucking am

You never dealt with such rejection
Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal
You've never seen so much aggression
I am the scream to your fucking silence

I live it every day
Don't know another way

Attitude is my addiction
I live life with no regret
Unlike you it's my affliction
That creates the template of all that I am

You know I know
No matter what you say
You'll be beaten today
Like every other day

Something about you
Keeps you from letting go
Of lame obsessions
Built up inside you
Forget the guesswork
You're starting at the source
Gazing into my eyes
You'll see there's no remorse
'cause this is my war
All day and every day
It's all about the conflict
Yeah!

Bring on the competition
Your pessimism only makes my stronger
I am the culmination
The fucking Standard that all will follow

I live it every day
Don't know another way

// Skeleton Christ //

[King]

Unbound God's creation
Has grown into the sinner
Abandoned innocence
Impenitent transgressor
Escape mortality
They say your life can change
If you take God's hand
Embrace rebirth
Your cleansing's so divine
To be reborn in God's eyes

You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming
Life's too short to be focused on insanity
I've seen the ways of God
I'll take the devil any day
Hail Satan

[Lead King]

Your faith has atrophied
And rots in hell's asylum
Despondence tears you down
A free-falling social stain
Escape atrocity
They say your life can change
If you take God's hand
Embrace rebirth
Your cleansing's so divine
To be reborn in God's lies

You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming
It's all a fuckin' mockery
No grasp upon reality
It's mind control for
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ

You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity
I've seen the ways of God
I'll take the devil any day
Hail Satan

[Lead King]

You'll never touch God's hand
You'll never taste God's breath
Because you'll never see the second coming
It's all a fuckin' mockery
No grasp upon reality
It's mind control for
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ

[Lead Hanneman]

// Eyes Of The Insane //

[Lyrics & Music: King]

A soldier's heart
Reflecting back at me
I keep seeing mutilated faces
Even in my dreams
Distorted images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Devouring my brain

The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign

Tortured spirits
Will not let me rest
These thoughts of mutilated faces
Completely possessed
Fragmented images
Flashing rapidly
Psychotically abusing me
Whirling through my head

Shellshocked
Battle fatigue
Overwhelming anxiety
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death raising it's ugly face at me!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more
They're all dead
Keep haunting me
They just keep coming back for more!

The eyes of the insane
On a demented campaign
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death raising it's ugly face at me!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more!
Death's face keeps haunting me
And just keeps coming back for more!

Got to make it stop
Can't take it any more!
Death's face keeps haunting me
And just keeps coming back for more!

A soldier
Of misfortune
I owe my pain and suffering
To this hell
These demons
Ripping through my soul
Evil's relentless hostility
Won't let me sleep

Shellshocked
Battle fatigue
Devastating insanity
Flashbacks
Panic attacks
Death's rotting
He's coming for me!!

// Jihad //

I have witnessed your death
I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrypted little mind
A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall

I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will hunt you down again for Him

God won't judge what I've done
He crawls upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged to fear
Await the coming of the God!

I will watch you die again for Him

Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
I've seen the end it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh it melts
Spilling from the sky

I will see you burn alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war

War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead

Fuck your God erase his name
A lady weeps insane with sorrow
I'll take his towers from the world
You're fucking raped upon your deathbed

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war
Fucking holy war

Be optimistic, happy, and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the non-believers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it's a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
The Great Satan!

// Consfearacy //

[King]

[All Leads: King]

I need to redefine
All the things I hate today
Politics that fail
From a president derailed
I hate the shit economy
It might as well be sodomy
I know that in the end
I'm expected to pretend

But I can't relate
To your verbal idiocy
No one's in control
When the government's the enemy

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy

Actions of hostility
Breeds conformity
Annihilation will begin
Extermination from within

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy

I need to redefine
How I see the world today
Seems that all the war
Didn't even up the score
It's only mind pollution
There is no resolution
Still I know that in the end
I'm expected to pretend
That I can Think of myself
Blame it all on someone else
Half-hearted smile
While you look the other way
I can't relate
To your verbal idiocy
No one's in control
When the government's the enemy

So light the fuse
Impose your views
Consfearacy
Is anarchy

// Catatonic //

[King]

Fear is just interpretation
Feeds my motivation
Our time together is
A bloodbath of serenity
Plead no more
There's no confusing the final
Excitation
My rancid passion is electrified

Accept this
My religion of torture
I can't see any purity
Just imperfection and obscenity
My blood soaked hands devise
Your slow methodic demise
Asphyxiate the world
It's blind without me

Catatonic
Catatonic
I'm numb in priceless solitude
Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near

[Lead King]

Visions of decapitation
My mental masturbation
I try to resurrect
Your consciousness, your intellect
Once so pure
Your pain excites and tests me
Excitation
The empty stare emitting from your eye

Embrace it
My religion of torture
All I see are the impurities
The imperfections and obscenities

[Lead King / Hanneman]

Accept this
My religion of torture
Excitation
The rancid passion coming from your eyes

My blood soaked hands devise
Your slow methodic demise
Asphyxiate the world
It's blind without me

Catatonic
Catatonic
I'm numb in priceless solitude
Exhilarating all the voices multitudes
I can't stop because it's so hypnotic
Catatonic

// Black Serenade //

[Music: Hanneman; lyrics: Hanneman / Araya]

Terrorize frozen eyes stare deep in me
Paralyzed inside death breeds on your pain
Pretty lace lie in hate you wear my scars
Terrified you find that you push me too far
Your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh
Rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul

Petrified that I decide the moment of your death
Belongs to me the taste is sweet it's so unreal

Your God weeps, it bleeds, it begs for me
God is letting you recover

[Lead Hanneman]

Welcome to my Black Serenade
The entrance of my hell your pain
Scream your song the Black Serenade
Live in fear a mind insane

Voice inside my head
Your face still shows itself to me
Telling me you're dead
Staring at your Lifeless body
I saw you fucking die
My mind's tearing itself apart
Screaming from the inside
Release this pain from my fucking heart

Destroy the empty shell
Smash away the haunting fear
I hate your endless stare
Watching as I fuck your corpse

Welcome to my Black Serenade
The entrance of my hell your pain
Walk through a tortured mind
You'll scream your song in time

Welcome to my Black Serenade
The entrance of my hell your pain
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade

Live in fear no coming back

[Lead King]

Welcome to my Black Serenade
The entrance of my hell your pain
Walk through a tortured mind
You'll scream your song in time

Welcome to my Black Serenade
The entrance of my hell your pain
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade
Live in fear death back

// Cult //

Oppression is the Holy Law
In God I distrust
In time His monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust
Is war and creed the master plan?
The Bible's where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere

[Refrain:]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

The pestilence of Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
666!

[Solo - Hanneman]

Corruption breeds the pedophile
Don't pray for the priest
Confession finds the lonely child
God preys on the weak
You think your soul can still be saved
I think you're fucking miles away
Scream out loud, here's where you begin
Forgive me Father for I have sinned!

[Refrain:]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

The target's fucking Jesus Christ
I would've lead the sacrifice
And nailed him to the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
666!

Jesus is pain
Jesus is gore
Jesus is the blood
That's spilled in war
He's everything
He's all things dead
He's pulling on the trigger
Pointed at your head!

Through the fear you're sold into the fraud
Revelation,
Revolution,
I see through your Christ illusion!

[Solo - King]

The war on terror just drags along
My war with God is growing strong
His propaganda sells despair
And spreads this violence everywhere

[Refrain:]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

There is no fucking Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice
666!

// Supremist //

[King]

Crushing all you worthless goals
I define control
Your pain's my fucking ecstasy
So putrid is my world of tyranny

To accentuate your desperation
Flesh from bone I'll rip and tear
I hate the fact that we breath the same air

Helpless as I dominate
I won't celebrate
Until you've all been crucified
I can not rest till everyone has died

I can't stand the victim in you
Infecting everything that I do
I will eradicate
Obliterate depopulate
Divine atrocious suffering
Cleansation of the weak
Supremacy

Pissing on your faith
Incinerate God's whore
Perpetual is my reign
I will eat your soul

[Lead King]

Must maintain control of the weak

[Lead Hanneman]

Must maintain control of the weak
Must contain the minds of the free

// Final Six //

Surrender your cloth and collar priest
There's no need for your beliefs in war
This is a place for heathens
Into that darkness fires illuminate
Grotesquely swollen by the heat
A half-burned corpse hanging naked
A stream is poisoned by the dead
I ghostly light, debris of war

Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it

What has man become a funeral pyre
Now that judgement's near prepare to die
Need to suffer lust for power mindless hunger never win

Final six is here the cycle ends

I have come for you my child
And the gift I bring is murder
Sumarian death in eastern winds
Face the father of your terror
Godless warheads wait to breath
Set their sights on history
Distant silhouettes of the dead
Blacken face screams through the ashes

Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it

What has man become a funeral pyre
Now that judgement's near prepare to die
Need to suffer lust for power mindless hunger never win

Final six is here the cycle ends

Mankind owes his pain to hell
As he brings the end upon himself
Arms rising from the ashes
In the ghastly light of human flares
Berith soldiers capture souls
Shadows of human sacrifice
The return of everything that's dead
A cryptic promise from the heavens

Lead us to the brink of extinction
The time has come for you now to finish it

Dead flowers for a faceless dead
A city engulfed by the smell of the death
Bodies piled beneath the mist
Walking dead among the living
The world will bleed while horseman ride
Now that God has wept for Judas
Days are numbered find your grave
Forever trying to escape to hell
