// Poor Tom //

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreaming of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work is done
Been lazing out in the noonday sun
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she would play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dresses down

Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her running around

Poor Tom, seventh son
Gotta die for what you have done
All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Hey
Keep a-trucking
Keep a-trucking
Hey

// Walter's Walk //

Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let it go
Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor

I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day

You know it's hard, I said it's hard
You know it's true
I said it's hard, you know it's hard
Still know it's true

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk

You know it is true now
You know it is true now
Ooh, yeah

I am walking the floor over you
I am walking the floor

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Does it matter now?
Does it, now does it matter?
Does it matter?

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

Ooh, little baby, don't you know
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah
Oh yes
Oh yes

// Ozone Baby //

I hear ya knock on my door
I ain't been saving this scene for ya, honey
Don't want you ringing my bell
It's too late for you to be my honey

Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
My own

Don't want you wasting my time
Tired of ya doing the things that you do
It's no use standing in line
Follow the line, you better follow queue

I say, ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
I say, ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
My own

I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah, but I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away
I save a lifetime forever
But you know, you know, you know what I say

And I say ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love

// Wearing And Tearing //

It starts out like a murmur
Then it grows like thunder
Until it bursts inside of you
Try to hold it steady
Wait until you're ready
Any second now will do
Throw the door wide open
Not a word is spoken
Anything that you want to do

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

Ah, don't you feel the same way?
Ah, don't you feel the same way?
But you don't know what to do?
No time for hesitating
Ain't no time for hesitating
All you got to do is move
They say you're feeling blue, well
I just found a cure
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

Now listen
Well you say your body's aching?
Well, I know that it's aching
Chill bumps come up on you
Yeah, the funny fool
I love the funny fool
Just like fooling after school
And then you ask for medication
Who cares for medication?
When you've worn away the cure?

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

Go back to the country
Yeah, go back to the country
Feel a change is good for you
When you keep convincing
Ah, don't keep convincing
Well, what's that creeping up behind a you?
It's just an old friend
It's just an old friend
And what's that he's got for you?

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know, and you know, and you know

Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance
Ooh, medication
Medication!
Medication!

// Baby, Come On Home //

There was a time, I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy woman, talking for hours and hours on the telephone

Then one day, I set you up to walk right outta my life
Leaving me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night

(Babe ooh, I want you to come back home yeah (come on home)
(Ooh yeah) Sweet little girl (ooh yeah, been gone so long)
Been away so long

Now listen to me: I said I made up my mind
Woman when you left me there, oh
I was gonna find another sweet lover
Who's gonna feel all of my cares

So I met a sweet little girl, just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman, but she turned around
And did the same thing again to me

(Babe Baby, please come home (come on home) home yeah
I know, (you been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe I want you to please come home, oh (come on home)

So I made up my mind, I gonna crawl right back to you woman
I'm gonna plead and plead and plead, yeah, 'til you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
'Cause I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it, I wanna make you mine

Babe, babe, babe, please (come on home, yeah come on home)
(You've been gone too long)

// Travelling Riverside Blues //

Hey
That's right

Asked sweet mama, let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid."
Well, I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said, I know my rider if I see her in the dark

Now, I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Still barrel house, but it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama, Lord, a brown-skin, but she ain't no plum
Uh-huh, see my baby, tell her, tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone
See my baby, tell her hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey, she promises, she's my rider
I want to tell you, she's my rider
I know you're mine, she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Anybody ask if you and me met, I keep them satisfied
But, uh, see my baby, tell her, tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no Lord since you nowhere
Ah, yeah

Won't you come in my kitchen

She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon
'Til the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm going to fall right out of bed

Ah, she's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side, yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brown-skin sugar plum

// Hey Hey What Can I Do //

Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

I got a woman, want to ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

On Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street corner girl

I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play

I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to ball all day, yeah, yeah, naw, naw
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman, and she won't be true

(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I said she won't be true, naw
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(No, no, what can I say?)
Yeah, no, yeah, no

Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah-yeah

(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
(No, no, what can I say?)
Hey, hey, what can I do? I got a woman, she won't be true
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Oh oh oh oh, hear what I say, I got a woman, wanna ball all day
(No, no, what can I say?)
Keep on, keep on, ooh-ho-ho-ho-ho
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)

// If It Keeps On Raining (Rough Mix) //

If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay

I worked on the levee, mama both night and day
I worked on the levee, mama both night and day
Had to work so hard, keep this water away
Oh Lord, oh no. Oh Lord, oh no.

Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes, I gotta leave this home

Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
Crying won't help you, mama praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, baby you've got to move, you got to move now

Keep on crying, keep on trucking along
Keep on grinding, keep on trucking along
I've been digging by the leaves, I'm sure they're coming home, oh well now

Going home, going home
Going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
