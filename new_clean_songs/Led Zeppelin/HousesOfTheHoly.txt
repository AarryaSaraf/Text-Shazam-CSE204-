// The Song Remains The Same //

I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People, won't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

Na-na-na-na-na
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same, ooh yeah

All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Ooh, sing out Hare Hare
Ooh, Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Through

// The Rain Song //

It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, ooh, oh

It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, oh, oh
But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uh, ooh, yeah yeah yeah

// Over The Hills And Far Away //

Hey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darling, darling, darling, walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known

// The Crunge //

I wanna tell you about my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names, but
He sure is a good friend, and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, boy
If I tell you, you won't come again, hey
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, but I do will, but I know, yeah!
Now let me tell you about my girl
I open up a newspaper and what do I see?

Ah, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me

Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Let me tell you, when she talks, she talks
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I wanna make her mine, baby
Ooh, tell me, baby, what you want me to do!
And you want me to love you, love some other men?
Ooh, ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no!
I don't need no respect from nobody, no

Ah yeah, no, no
Ah

I ain't gonna tell you nothing, I ain't gonna tell you no more, no!
She's my baby, let me tell you that I love her so and, and!
She is the woman I really wanna love and let me tell you more
Ooh! She's my baby let me tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a woman the one a woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going to tell
I ain't going to tell you one thing
That you really ought to know, boy!

She's my lover, baby, and I love her so, and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl, and
She's the kind of lover that makes me feel the whole world, and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, oh!
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about!
Take it on
Take it, take it, take it

Ah, excuse me
Oh, will you excuse me?
I'm just trying to find the bridge!
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please!
(Have you seen the bridge?)
I ain't seen the bridge!
(Where's that confounded bridge?)

// Dancing Days //

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright
You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah!

// D'yer Mak'er //

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All those tears I cry, oh, oh, oh, ay, ay
Baby, please don't go

When I read the letter you wrote me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the words that it told me, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every breath I take oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Darling, please don't go

When I read the letter you sent me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it broke, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, and I can't let you go
I love you, ooh baby, I love you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ooh, yeah (Fire)
Oh baby, baby

// No Quarter //

Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter

Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (giving me, giving me no)
Oh (I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!)

// The Ocean //

"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (ooh)
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

I don't know
Oh-oh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na

Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

Oh, so good!
