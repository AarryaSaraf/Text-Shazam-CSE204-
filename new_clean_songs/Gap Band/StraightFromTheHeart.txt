// Sweeter Than Candy //

So sweet

Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

If there's one thing I know, the girl's just right for me
She's as sweet as she can be when she's next to me
Just like a rose, she's as sweet as they grow
I just wanna keep her in my life
She's my number one, she's as sweet as they come
Who could ask for very much more?
You're so sweet to me, come on and be with me
'Cause you're the one that I adore

Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

Sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

Only time will tell if you will stay my girl
And just be with me all the way
'Cause there's one thing I know wherever I go
I want you with me any way

Girl, you're sweet as candy, girl, I know
Girl, you're sweet as candy, girl, I know

Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

Well, my name is Krazy Tee in the place to be
We goin' down on young ladies with the G-A-P
I'm a double-theater rocker with the mic in my hand
And I'm sweeter than candy, uh, take it from me
Young ladies on top, just come and see
Just rockin' non-stop with a sweet melody
Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Flash
Run-DMC with the G-A-P
And I mean that, uh

Girl, you're sweet
Girl, you're sweet, sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet (Sweet), sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more

Girl, you're sweet (Sweet), sweeter than candy
(Sweeter than you've ever been)
Sweeter than you've ever been before
Girl, you're sweet (Sweet), sweeter than candy (Sweet)
Girl, I think I love you more

Girl, you're sweet (Sweet), sweeter than candy
Sweeter than you've ever been before (Give me that candy)
Girl, you're sweet (Sweet), sweeter than candy
Girl, I think I love you more
