// Some Other Spring //

Some other spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn
Left chrushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the night bring
Another to me?

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me 
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring
Will my heart awake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Love in some other spring?
Spring?

// You're So Desirable //

You're so desirable
I just can't resist you
You're so desirable
I have to give in
That tirm resolve I made
Has vanished away now
I'm happy to say now
You win

You're so adorable
The moment I saw you
It's just deplorable
The fool that I've been
And yet I'm glad
You've got my heart dear
Like a butterfly on a pin
You're so desirable
I had to give in

// You're Gonna See A Lot Of Me //

I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
I'll make you love me, wait and see
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me

I'm gonna haunt you, I'm gonna haunt you
Oh what a pest I'm gonna be
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me

I'll be the spoon in your coffee
The knife that butters your bread
If I sound a little bit off it
That's because because because
you've gone to my head

If you're in China, I'll go to China
I'll never never let you free
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me

// Hello, My Darling //

I'll forget your tender kiss
I'll be brave after this kiss
I'll say "hello my darling"
It we should meet again

You'll forbid the tears to slip
You'll behave, bite your lip
And say "hello my darling"
If we should meet again

If we do meet again
Our moments can't be sweet again
Oh my love, go my love
Though it's a bitter pill, I know my love

Please remember not to sigh
Over this last goodbye
Just say "hello my darling"
If we should meet again

// Let's Dream In The Moonlight //

Let's dream in the moonlight
Tell me that you love me
Tell the stars above me
What's in you heart

Let's dream in the moonlight
Say you're glad you found me
Put your arms around me
Before we part

Even though it's just pretending
And the night is almost through
I can say I'm only lending
When I give my heart to you

Let's dream in the moonlight
Let your lips touch mine
Though we're only dreaming tonight
Tonight

// That's All I Ask Of You //

You've heard my story before
I've often told it you know
Well it's just the same
A dream that's been in vain
Someone to miss when I'm away
Someone to kiss at close of day
A hear that's new 
With a love thats true
That's all i ask of you

Someone to care when things look blue
A love to share my whole life through
We're side by side
Just a groom and a bride
Thats all I ask of you

Now most of my plans have crumbled and faded
May this one come true
I'll make a start
I'll give you my hart
The rest is up to you

So give your love
In one sweet kiss
I ask no more of you than this
Be sweet and kind
Say that you'll be mine
That's all I ask of you

// Dream Of Life //

My life was empty when you went away
Even the blue skies above had turned gray
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
Those little quarrels that tore us apart
Oh, gee, I can see
They were wrong from the start
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay

// What Shall I Say? //

What shall I say
When our neighbours want us to come to tea?
They don't know you're not with me
What shall I say?

What shall I say
When the phone rings and someone asks for you
They don't know I ask for you too
What shall I say?

How can I hide the tears inside
How can I face the crowd?
I can,make lips of mine be still
But my heart sighs too loud

I could explain that
You're only gone for a walk to shop
But after the week is up
What shall I say?

// It's Easy To Blame The Weather //

Honestly I'm glad it's snowing
It helps to keep our friends from knowing
When they ask me why I'm sad
It's easy to blame the weather

It's funny how the blinding snow flakes
Are right in time to hide my heartache
Let them ask me why I'm sad
It's easy to blame the weather

When I think of the sun
It scares me
I wonder if I will pass
And springtime, I hear
Is early this year
They'll see through me like glass

I see no reason for this weather
So let me be the first to make up
If a reason must be had
It's easy to blame the weather

// More Than You Know //

More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know

// Sugar (That Sugar Baby O' Mine) //

Sugar, I call my baby my sugar
I never maybe my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
He's special ration
Funny, he never asks for my money
All I give him is honey
And that he can spend anytime

I'd make a million trips to lips
It I were a bee
Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me
He's confectionary

Sugar, I never cheat on my Sugar
Cause I'm too sweet on my Sugar
That sugar baby of mine

// You're Too Lovely To Last //

Just when you are near
When I hold you fast
Then my dreams will whisper
You're too lovely to last.

Lips are saying "Love"
All worries have passed
And then I get that feeling
You're too lovely to last.

Will I ever know a real love?
So I can forget you
Will I always have to still love?
What am I to do?

Soon the night is gone
Dreams are fading fast
Then I wake up knowing
You're too lovely to last.

Will I ever know a real love?
So I can forget you
Will I always have to still love?
What am I to do?

Soon the night is gone
Dreams are fading fast
Then I wake up knowing
You're too lovely to last
Baby you're too lovely
You're much too lovely to last

// Under A Blue Jungle Moon //

Life's just like a dream
Just a beautiful dream
Under a blue jungle moon

Love calls out to love
From the wood and the stream
Call with a weird savage tune
Through the night comes melodies entrancing
All through the night in pairs the world romancing
My own heart calls too
Jungle sweetheart for you
Under a blue jungle moon

Through the night comes melodies entrancing
All through the night in pairs the world romancing
My own heart calls too
Jungle sweetheart for you
Under a blue jungle moon

// Everything Happens For The Best //

Always blue all in a mist
It's plain as can be
You're so mean to me
But everything happens for the best
You always play around
You're running my heart so deep in the ground
That O.K. everything happens for the best
I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best

I loved you so madly
Knew you would be true
Now this thing has happened dear
It's over all over because we're through
So sorry dear it end this way
Since the world begin
The old folks say
Everything happens for the best

// Why Did I Always Depend On You? //

Why did I always depend on you
When I knew that you'd end
In another's arms?
As a rule I'm no fool
But it seems where love's concerned
There's no rule for a fool
Who would let his heart be burned

And you intended to fool me too
That's no lie
And you can't deny it's true
From the start in my heart
I knew what you'd do
Why did I depend on you?

// Long Gone Blues //

Talk to me baby
Tell me what's the matter now
Tell me, baby what's the matter now?
Are you tryin' to quit me, baby
But you don't know how

I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your babe

But before I see you go
I see you in your grave

I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong

I'm a good gal
But my love is all wrong

I'm a real good gal
But my love is gone

// Our Love Is Different //

Our love is different dear
It's like a mighty symphony
I can feel its silver harmony
Oh so tenderly, day by day

Our love is different dear
To me it's almost heavenly
Let us guard it ever preciously
Even jealously
While we may
A love like ours dear heart
The angels send
And as I know dear heart
That it won't ever end
For as the years roll by
You'll learn my love for you is true
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you
For our love is different dear

A love like ours dear heart
The angels send
And as I know dear heart
That is won't ever end
For as the years roll by
You'll learn my love for you is true
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you
For our love is different dear
