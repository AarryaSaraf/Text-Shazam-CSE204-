Album: AntiHero

// Forever Starts Now //

They live in this time and this place
He holds her close as he laughs in her face
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
When the rubber hits the road
What could go wrong?
Nothing's wrong

What they gonna get at the end?
He gets down on one knee to make amends
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
That's when for him it's gone wrong
It's gone wrong

Her compliance will pay big dividends
So he gets down on one knee to make amends
He wants to be a hero, a hero!

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
She won't sing along with his song
With his song

// Day Turns To Night //

Nothing is ever
Meant to last forever
It's a clich√© 'cause it's true
I don't feel no regrets
Just so I can remember
Is it too late to say thank you

You caught me just in time
Before it got too late
Now nothing'll be the same
You've forever changed my fate

First I was nobody
Till you gave me the key
Opened the door for me
Then I was somebody

I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
'Cause I'll never forget all the years
That you brought me along for the ride
Took the world on side by side

So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night

I'm a little bit older
A little bit wiser
'Cause you taught me how to do it right
Only now that it's done
And the war, it is won
I can see that it was worth the fight

You gave me everything
Didn't want anything in return
With every step you'd take
Every move you'd make, I learnt

First I was nobody
Till you gave me the key
Opened the door for me
Then I was somebody

I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
'Cause I'll never forget all the years
That you brought me along for the ride
Took the world on side by side

So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when the day turns into night

So long, goodbye
So long, goodbye

// Change The Locks (2020) //

Indiscernible identity
So many passing by, she seems
Silver sprayed living statue
She stands watching the absurdity

The idea of self is a placebo
Run the data, it knows where you go
Oh, I'm a construct
Oh, I'm a suspect but don't want it known

Change the locks, the system is down
They said everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

Do what you want, you won't be found out
You'll never be held to account
We're just getting static on the line
A broken voice says everything's fine

You and a friend could be our guest
At our request, come and fine dine
Yeah, it's our gift for you to celebrate
The last of the mall's great redesign

Change the locks, the system is down
They said everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

The kings of comedy
The kings of comedy

Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang but we just didn't see it

Change the locks, the system is down
They said everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

// Glass (2020) //

Look through the window
Look through the window
Look through the window
I'm looking through a pane of glass

Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
I'm looking through a pane of glass

I'm so restless
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
We talk about this and we talk about that

I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
We talk about this and we talk about that

Light myself
Light myself
Light myself
Nicotine really goes to my head

Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Nicotine really goes to my head

If you're feeling all in take some asprin
If you feel in a mess put your head on a head rest
Your back on a back rest, foot on a foot rest
Or your arm on an arm rest or your leg on a leg rest

Your back on a back rest, if you feel in a real mess
When you're feeling all in
Take some aspirin
Or some paracetamol

Always thought life should be so easy
It seems that I have misunderstood
Nothing I do can seem to please me
What I say don't sound so good

I always thought
I always thought
I always thought
It seems that I have misunderstood
