// Lucy Leave //

Leave when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please fall away from me, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl

See that I'm so broken up about you, Lucy
Mean treating me and done me harm, Lucy
Been in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl

I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no
You tear me apart, you just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe
Now Lucy leave, Lucy

Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please fall away from me, little girl
Yeah, go, little girl

See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy
Yeah, go

// Double O Bo //

Bo Diddley was a private eye
Hand was fast and his I.Q. high
D.A. said, "Double O, you won't last
Slow down, boy. You're living too fast."

Well, Double O had a Cadillac
Machine guns and a bullet-proof back
Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like a sure way of getting to heaven

In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead
To keep Bo Diddley from getting dead
Another thing had Bo keeping alive
Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45

Yeah

Well, Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon
Martini's dry, and you better serve them
Martini so dry, the shaker burst
Bo keeled on his side and died of thirst

// Remember Me //

Remember me (aaaaah-ha)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaah-ha)
I've been here before
Can't you see
I wanna stick around some more

Can't you see (aaaaah-ha)
I want some love from you
Can't you see (aaaaah-ha)
I want some love from you
Don't go away now
I've got something to give to you

I'll try to be (aaaaa-ha)
As good as gold to you
Try to be (aaaaa-ha)
As good as gold to you
But don't blame me, girl
If I'm far from cold to you

Remember me (aaaaa-ha)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaa-ha)
I've been here before
Don't go away now
Come and stick around some more
Yeah

// Walk With Me Sydney //

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, roll with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, roll with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Roll with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Roll me, roll me, roll me high
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, walk with me, Sydney
I'd love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, and hold me tight
Well, I'd love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

// Butterfly //

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

Sometime when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
'Cause it drive me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly

I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love

I won't write your name
In Latin in a frame
'Cause framing is a chain

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

// I'm A King Bee //

Well, I'm a King Bee
Buzzing around your hive
Yes, I'm a King Bee, child
Buzzing around your hive
I can make good honey
Let me come inside

I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
You know I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
Well, when you hear me buzz, little girl
You know some stinging going on

Well, buzz some
Oh sting
Yeah

Well, I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long
Yes I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long
Well, I can buzz better baby
When your man is gone
