// Apples And Oranges //

Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly 
To meet the people
She's on time again 
And then 
I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you

Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the riverside, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide
(Quack, quack, quack, quack)

Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

// Candy And A Currant Bun //

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that

Ooh, don't talk to me
Please, just fuck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon

Ooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very, very, very frail

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that

// Hey, Hey, Rise Up //

[Ukrainian:]

Ой у лузі червона калина похилилася
Чогось наша славна Україна зажурилася
А ми тую червону калину підіймемо
А ми нашу славну Україну, хей, хей, розвеселимо
А ми нашу славну Україну, хей, хей, розвеселимо

(Хей, хей)

[English translation:]

Oh, in the meadow a red viburnum has bent down low
For some reason, our glorious Ukraine is in sorrow
And we'll take that red viburnum and we will raise it up
And we shall cheer for our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey
And we shall cheer for our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey

// It Would Be So Nice //

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet, sometime

Everybody wakes, and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please
Have you ever read the Daily Standard?
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down?

And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place

But no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

// King Bee (Slim Harpo 1957) //

Well, I'm a King Bee
Buzzing around your hive
Yes, I'm a King Bee, child
Buzzing around your hive

I can make good honey
Let me come inside
I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
You know I'm young and able
To buzz all night long

When you hear me buzz, little girl
You know some stinging's going on
(Well, buzz some) I'll sting (yeah)

Well, I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long
Yes I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long

Well, I buzz better baby
When your man is gone

// Point Me At The Sky //

Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad, we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and

Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, "This is my last goodbye"

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in

People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye

(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)
(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye)

// Scream Thy Last Scream //

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers, point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter
Flat tops of houses, mouses, houses
Fiddle and Diddle as sitting bat tat
Watching the telly till all hours - telly time!
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

// Seabirds //

Mighty waves come crashing down
The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind
Is calling sailors to the deep
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
Surf is high an' the sea is awash
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun
That was hot to touch
And the sea was emerald green
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear
And I can see you smile
Surf comes rushing up the beach
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
Catfish dappled silver flashing
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep

// Vegetable Man //

In yellow shoes I get the blues
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?

So I've changed my gear, and I find my knees
And I covered them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
They don't make long of my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all the lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am
Vegetable man

I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can
Vegetable man

// What Shall We Do Now //

What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?

Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the East?
Contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure?
Store up leisure?
But never relax at all
With our backs to the wall
