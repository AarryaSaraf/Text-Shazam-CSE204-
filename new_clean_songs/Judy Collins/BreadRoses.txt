Album: BreadRoses

// Bread And Roses //

As we go marching, marching in the beauty of the day
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses
For the people hear us singing: "Bread and roses! Bread and roses!"

As we come marching, marching, we battle too for men
For they are women's children, and we mother them again
Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses!

As we go marching, marching, unnumbered women dead
Go crying through our singing their ancient song of bread
Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew
Yes, it is bread we fight for - but we fight for roses, too!

As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days
The rising of the women means the rising of the race
No more the drudge and idler â€” ten that toil where one reposes
But a sharing of life's glories: Bread and roses! Bread and roses!

Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies;
Bread and roses! Bread and roses!

// Everything Must Change //

Everything must change
Nothing remains the same
Everyone will change
No one, no one stays remains the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
No one and nothing goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
One can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
No one and nothing goes unchanged

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
No one and nothing stays unchanged

There are not many things in life
One can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly
Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly

Everything must change

// Special Delivery //

I got two kinds of lovers
One on each coast
All those miles don't mean a thing
And I don't mean to boast
One is my music man
One is the sun
One is my ocean

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
Special delivery
Delivers me
Deliver me

Most of us believe in what we cannot see
But there's more to living than photography
All the threads that link us eternally
Think of electricity

I lose my gravity
I feel my liberty coming home
With your special delivery

Anytime the ordinary brings me down
Just the thought of you
So extraordinary
Brings me round

It's all done with mirrors in the carnival show
Telepathy's a hoax, at least they tell us so
When I hear you call from inside me
I know I can be your radio

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
When your special delivery
Delivers me

Oh I love my music man
I love the sun
I love my ocean

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
With your special delivery
Deliver me

Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery

// Out Of Control //

It seems I've always been in charge before
I made the rules and they were followed
The men I loved would gather at my door
To wait the word for the day

I must admit I had my moments
When I wished the world would suddenly go mad
But then I'd come back to my senses
And think how sweet was that freedom I thought I had

Out of control you send me
I never know where it will end for me
You put the lights in my head, a song in my bed

Oh, nothing I say can change you
You know your way, life is clear to you
All I can do when you call me is follow
Oh, I am a woman as sensible as can be

Out of control, you spin me
Take me again, your love is winning me
I'd follow you anywhere you say
I fell in love with you today

// Spanish Is The Loving Tongue //

Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spray
T'was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her loved words over
Mostly when Im all alone!
Mi amor, Mi corazon
Haven't seen her since that night
I cant cross the line you know
Wanted for a gambling fight
Like as not its better so
Still I've always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Adios, Mi corazon.

// I Didn't Know About You //

I ran around, with my own little crowd
The usual laughs, not often, but loud
And in the world that I knew
I didn't know about you

Chasing after the ring, on the merry-go-round
Just taking my fun, where it could be found
And yet what else could I do
I didn't know about you

Darling, now I know
I had the loneliest yesterday, everyday
In your arms
I know for once in my life, I'm living

Had a good time, everytime I went out
Romance was a thing, I kidded about
How could I know about love
I didn't know about you

Darling, now I know
I had the loneliest yesterday, everyday
In your arms
I know for once in my life, I'm living

Had a good time, everytime I went out
Romance was a thing, I kidded about
How could I know about love
I didn't know about you

I didn't know about you

// Take This Longing //

Many men have loved the bells
You fastened to the rein
And everyone who wanted you
They found what they will always want again
Your beauty lost to you yourself
Just as it was lost to them

Oh, take this longing from my heart
Oh, the useless things these hands have done
And let me see your beauty broken down
As you do for one you love

Your body like a searchlight
My own poverty reveals
How I would love to try your charity
Until you cry, "Now you must try my greed"
And everything depends upon
How near you sleep to me

Oh, take this longing from my heart
Oh, the useless things these hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
As you do for one you love

As hungry as an archway
Through which the troops have passed
I stand in ruins behind you
With your winter clothes and your broken sandal straps
I love to see you naked over there
Especially from the back

Take this longing from my heart
All the lonely things these hands have done
Untie my blue silk gown
As you do for one you love

You're faithful to my better self
I'm afraid she left
Let me judge your love affair
In this very room where you've sentenced
Mine to death
Look, I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
That you've shaken from your head

Oh, take this longing from my tongue
All the useless lonely things these hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
As you would do for one you love

As you would do for one you love

// Love Hurts //

Here I am at your door
Hoping you'll come back once more
And here I am and your love has died
It's one thing I wish you could hide

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you

I've heard it said that time brings relief
But hey just how long will it take
And here I am I feel like a fool
For causing this fool's heart to break

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you

How can I see you like seeing a friend
when each time I see you I break down again

Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you
Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you

// King David //

King David was a sorrowful man
No cause for his sorrow had he
And he called for the music of a hundred harps
To ease his melancholy

They played till they all fell silent
Played and play sweet did they
But the sorrow that haunted the heart of King David
They could not charm away

He rose and in his garden
Walked by the moon alone
A nightingale hidden in a cypress tree
Jargoned on and on

King David lifted his sad eyes
Into the dark boughed tree
"Tell me, thou little bird that singest
Who taught my grief to thee?"

But the bird in no wise heeded
And the king in the cool of the moon
Harken to the nightingale's sorrowfulness
Till all his own was gone
