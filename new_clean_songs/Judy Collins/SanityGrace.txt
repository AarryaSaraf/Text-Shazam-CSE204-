// Pretty Polly //

"Polly, Pretty Polly, come go long with me-
Polly, Pretty Polly, come go long with me-
Before we get married, some pleasure to see"

She jumped up behind him and away they did ride-
She jumped up behind him, away they did go-
Over the mountains, and valleys so low.

"Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm a feared for my life-
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm a feared for my life-
I'm afraid you mean to murder me, and leave me behind.."

"Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed about right-
Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed about right-
I've been diggin' your grave, for the best part of last night."

She knelt down before him, pleading for her life-
She knelt down before him, pleading for her life,
"Let me be a single girl, if I cant be your wife.."

He stabbed her to the heart, and her heart blood did flow-
He stabbed her to the heart, and her heart blood did flow-
And into the grave, Pretty Polly did go.

He through a little dirt on her and started for home-
He through a little dirt over her and started for home-
Leaving nobody there, but the wild birds to moan..

A debt to the devil, Willie must pay-
A debt to the devil, Willie must pay-
For killing Pretty Polly, and running, and running, and running, and running away.
