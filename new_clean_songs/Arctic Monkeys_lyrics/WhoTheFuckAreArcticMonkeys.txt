// The View From The Afternoon //

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns and how

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block
Owt you send her after nine o'clock

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus, regardless of what's gone before

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that

And you can pour your heart out around 3 o'clock
When the 2-for-1s undone the writer's block

// Cigarette Smoker Fiona //

Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses

With wet white trousers on

And worlds collide as the evening continues

The dignity fucks off


Her brother's gone off to the strippers

To make up for all the lost time

She could have been one of the bitches

But she's actually alright


(Cigarette smoker)

I'm sorry, but we're all unsure

How much you've had but

(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more


A country home, even if we really tried

What if it's just surprises now?

And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap

When are your parents back? d'you know?


Well I never came from no ghetto

But it wasn't nowhere near here

Well-spoken girls in stilletoes

Aren't something to fear


(Cigarette smoker)

I'm sorry, but we're all unsure

How much you've had but

(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

[Instrumental]


(Cigarette smoker)

I'm sorry, but we're all unsure

How much you've had but

(We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more


(Cigarette smoker)

Cigarette smoke doesn't hide

As well as you think

And you'd think that it oughta

Act as the perfect disguise

// Despair In The Departure Lounge //

He's pining for her

In a people carrier 

There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that

But architecture won't do 

Although it might say a lot about the city or town

I don't care what they've got keep on turning them down 

It don't say the funny things she does

Don't even try and cheer him up, because

It just won't happen 


He's got the feeling again

This time on the aeroplane 

There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front

But Rodney and Del won't do 

Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains

Laugh when he falls through the bar

But you're feeling the same 

'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand

She won't be waiting for you when you land 


It feels like she's just nowhere near 

You could well be out on your ear 

This thought comes closely followed by the fear 

And the thought of it

Makes you feel a bit

Ill 


Yesterday I saw a girl

Who looked like someone you might knock about with

And almost shouted 

And then reality kicked in within us

It seems as we become the winners 

You lose a bit of summat

And half wonder if you won it at all


And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea 

And she's still nowhere near 

And the thought comes closely followed by the fear 

And the thought of it

Makes you feel a bit

...Ill 


Despair in the departure lounge

It's one and they'll still be around at three 

No signal and low battery 

What's happened to me

// No Buses //

Lady, where has your love gone?

I was looking but can't find it anywhere

They always offer when there's loads of love around

But, when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found


Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday

No chance, you'll get nothin' from me

But now she's there, you're there, everybody's there

He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be

Just like me


Let's go down, down, low down

Where I know I should not go

Oh and she thinks she's the one

But she's just one in 24

And just 'cause everybody's doin' it

Does that mean that I can, too?


Lady, where has your love gone?

It was the anti-septic to the sore

To hold you by the hand

Must be first, be in demand

How he longs for you to long for him once more

Just once more


Let's go down, down, low down

Where I know I should not go

Oh and she thinks she's the one

But she's just one in 24

And just 'cause everybody's doin' it

Does that mean that I can, too? Oh...


Her eyes went down and cut you up

And there's nothing like a dirty look from

The one you want, or the one you've lost


An ache in your soul is everybody's goal

To get what they can't have

That's why you're after her

And that's why she's after him

But sayin' it wont change a thing

And they'll realise that it wont change a thing

Realise that it wont change a thing

// Who The FucK Are Arctic Monkeys? //

We all want someone to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all, or is it just paranoia?

Everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your derides or individes
Will never unhinge us

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before ya

Just cause we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be playdoh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?"

'Cause everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your derides or individes
Will never unhinge us

[Instrumental]

(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)

All the thoughts that I just said
Will linger round and multiply in their head
Not that mad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues...

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash!

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue
It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape?
