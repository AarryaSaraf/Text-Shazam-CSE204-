// Stand Up //

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown

Big whack 'cause I eat a lot
Bitches always begging 'cause they need a lot
Car came with instructions, I don't read a lot
I come from the bottom, gotta feed the block
I don't need a chair, always come prepared
I am like the mayor, I am not the mayor
Gotta say a prayer 'fore I leave the house
Coat hanging off my shoulder, gotta see the blouse
Helmut Lang, don't I look scrumptious?
He keep staring at me like he want this
Million dollar, you cannot afford this
If I wanted I could make the Forbes list

(And I just can't seem to understand where you're coming from, my brother
Guess I'm just not like ya) Yeah
(Not like ya)

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown

I really only smile just to show my grill
Rather have the skill than the sex appeal
Signed a Lego deal just so I can build
Hammer time baby, this is not a drill
Six feet nigga, you ain't lookin' right
Straight edge hanging with the crooked type
First class, told Yeefy book the flight
We are not the same, we just look alike
I can't trust a soul, got the guacamole
Lotta people bold but in person fold
You are not thurl, you're plastic
I am not the queen? Sarcastic

(And I just can't seem to understand where you're coming from, my brother
Guess I'm just not like ya) Yeah
(Not like ya)

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown

// Meagan Good //

Yeah

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good (Yeah), I'm doin' Meagan Good

I think about how we had nothin' and had dreams of gettin' money
But it seem like when I signed you got jealous, actin' funny
Woulda thought you had a monthly, boy, you took me through hell
I was faithful to you, loyal when you did time in hail
You had rap dreams too, why you ain't write in that cell?
We had the same opportunity, I just chose to prevail
You lost ya homie in '06, rest in peace to Darnell
No disrespect, it's 2020, can't continue to dwell
I was under your spell, had sendin' Venmo and Zelle
While you out here sneakin' bitches in the nicest hotels
Even when you cheated, I felt defeated, but didn't seem it
I went and cheated back, I was heated, now I'm conceited

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good, I'm doin' Meagan Good

I don't regret nothin' we did and I hope you don't neither
I know it irritates your soul, the simple fact I don't need ya
I used to feel like I would die if we wasn't speakin'
Now I feel like I can fly and I found my beacon
My heart want love, so I gotta supply it
Your love wasn't healthy, so I'm on a new diet
I'm through cryin' with you lyin', 'cause I know better than that
Everything you did to me, ain't no editin' that
This ain't no movie, Paul Mooney, you was actin' up
Frontin' on me out in public, now I'm backin' up
I'm gone and I'm packin' up, you missed ya chance, passed it up
Hashtag mad for what? C'mon

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good, I'm doin' Meagan Good

// Millions //

And we coasting
Me and my gang, we float and we focused
I don't want no dealin' with no weak emotions
We about to drop, we ready, we loaded
I been gettin' money so the rent never late
Yellow G-SHOCK, I'm fashionably late
All white milk, I'm makin' it shake
They won't understand so I never debate
Broad Street bully 'cause the car got hips
Tape been done, all play, no skips
Walk-in closet, I could do three flips
I'ma do 'em nasty like sugar and grits, yeah
Nick got the cam', he witnessin' greatness
Low tolerance but I'm so high-maintenance
Chrome Hearts store, we shoppin' in Vegas
Old friends stuck, they shocked she made it (Yeah)
North Philly's own, I'm a God to the children
I done played my role as the hero and the villain

Y'all want millions? We want billions
Y'all want millions? We want trillions

Momma so proud, I don't owe you niggas nothin'
I be just chillin', they like, "Whack, why you stuntin'?"
Watch out for the snakes, they'll do you greazy (Yeah)
I be with cousin, that's my lil' Yeefy (Yeah, yeah)
I'll be there for him if he do ever need me (Yeah)
On these niggas' heads like a white boy beanie (Yeah, mm)
Walkin' in the hood and I do it so freely (Yeah)
Niggas see my sunroof, sittin' in the 'Ghini (Yeah, uh)
Mountain Valley water, I'm sippin' it cleanly (Yeah, mm)
Fancy restaurant, we eatin' zucchini (Yeah, mm)
Might settle down, depend on how he treat me (Yeah, mm)
Hard body baby, but I make it look easy

Y'all want millions? We want billions
Y'all want millions? We want trillions
Y'all want millions? We want billions
Y'all want millions? We want trillions
