Album: BloodmoonI

// Blood Moon //

Blood moon ascends in night
As the cosmic eye
Free of the chains
That define our lives

It cuts through flesh and bone
Into the glow of souls
Gazing far and wide
Devoid of hope

You cut me open
But I won't let you find
What's under the surface
Entombed in my mind
Beneath the surface
It's grim to see
Oh it echoes
Then disappears

Unblinking eye in the shadows
Abets the world its weary lies
Enthroned beside the dimming light
Speak what's left unspoken
The time is near

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

The mind was a hall that towered high
And on the throne was the child inside
And on my side, enthroned beside
The shadows divine held all the world
And the glimmering life
In mind was a time when all was right
Mind was in mind

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Blood moon ascends in the night
Cosmic unblinking eye
Gazing through flesh and bone
Into the glow of our souls

Cut me open
It's grim to see
Beneath the surface, etched in fear
The day has spoken
How dare you speak her name
To consecrate the broken
Carry weary worlds

The day has broken
A stain, a crime
You, serpent
Deicide
The day has broken
A stain, a crime
You, serpent
Deicide

// Viscera Of Men //

Invidious judgements move towards an end
Scatter and splatter, the viscera of men
This circle of fire is life on a wire
A culling of hatred, again and again

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
Flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
Flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Inside you
Never felt enough pain
But you were inclined to wonder
Inside you
A war was building
In time

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
To flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
To flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed
Until (until)
There is silence

Bleed
Until (until)
There is silence

// Coil //

Venomously
Winding and weaving
Blood and ivory
Obscure belief

A hidden hunger
Writhing and seething
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen

It's like
A serpent coiled inside
It's like
The sun shone on serpent's lies
And it's like this life
This life

It's like a serpent
Coiled inside me
Sign of the sacred song
Slithering sweetly
Odd with intention
This coil furls on and on

Slither with odd intentions
This coil furls on and on
The sacred song

Venomously
Winding and weaving
Blood and ivory
Obscure belief

A hidden hunger
Writhing and seething
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen

It's like
A serpent coiled inside
It's like
The sun shone on serpent's lies

And it's like
This life, this life

It's like a serpent
Coiled inside me
Sign of the sacred song
Slithering sweetly
Odd with intention
This coil furls on and on

Sign of the sacred song
This coil furls on and on

Sign of the sacred song
This coil furls on and on
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen
This coil furls on and on

// Flower Moon //

Flower moon
Hanging like a curse
Puncturing the dark
Wilting in reverse

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon

Flower moon
Tangled in the trees
Shining through
Wilting in the leaves

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon
Flower

Join you in the sky
Seize you eye to eye
Won't you stay in bloom?
Oh, flower moon
Flower moon

// Tongues Playing Dead //

No breath
Just blinding fog
No step
Just grinding slog

Tongues in our mouths
Playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads

No breath
Just blinding fog
No step
Just grinding slog

Tongues playing dead

No wheel
Just broken cogs
No meal
Just beaten dogs

Tongues in our mouths
Playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads

Tongues in our mouths
Playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads

We go silent
So, so silent, we go silent
It's so quiet
So, so quiet, it's so quiet

We go silent
So, so silent, we go silent
Playing dead, playing dead
It's so quiet
So, so quiet, it's so quiet

Playing dead, playing dead
Tongues playing dead

Tongues in our mouths
Playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads

Tongues in our mouths
Playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads

Let 'em rot out our heads
Tongues playing dead
Let 'em rot out of our heads
Tongues playing dead

Tongues playing dead

// Lord Of Liars //

You said it's not that you know it
You said it's all hysteria
You said it's not true knowledge
You said it's not that you know you're wrong

Spiteful destroyer
Lord of the liars
Cower to cowards
Ice age is coming

It's only salt inside you
You know it's only cauterized
You know it's slowly dying
You know you know it's dying

Spiteful destroyer
Lord of the liars
Cower to cowards
Ice age is coming

Goodbye liars
Goodbye cowards
Goodbye liars
Goodbye cowards
Go

We sat in sudden silence
We sat beneath your watching eye
You know we've not forgotten
You know you were unbound

// Failure Forever //

Pounds of flesh and pints of blood
Just won't ever be enough
To break our stare into the sun
And show us all how to love

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Tears of fear and seeds of doubt
We cannot reach beyond
To touch the face of fallen ones
Discerning needs from their wants

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall, the fear takes root

Growing constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall the fear takes root
Forever

Pounds of flesh and pints of blood
Just won't ever be enough
To break our stare into the sun
And show us all how to love

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Tears of fear and seeds of doubt
We cannot reach beyond
To touch the face of fallen ones
Discerning needs from their wants

Between you and me
Shines a light of disbelief

Constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall, the fear takes root

Growing constant reminders
Our failures last forever

As years fall the fear takes root
Forever

Failure forever
Failure forever

// Scorpion's Sting //

Come to me
Stand in witness
Come to me
Stand in witness

Oh, to see you
All the better
In joy or pain
I'll stay by your side

Come to me
Hold on tight, baby
Come to me
We are destructing

Sing, destroy, to create
We sing to love
Then we break
Who are...
Who are we?
Who are...
Who are we?

Overcome, vanquished
She is calling my name
And I'm answering
Baby, come
Baby, come to me
Take my hand
The scorpion's sting

All the better
Oh, to see you
Big eyes

Calm the storm, inside
'Cause I'll be right here by your side

// Daimon //

Your children will answer
For your crimes, crimes
Your children will answer
For your crimes, crimes

Bones clawed out of their bodies
Failed mortal designs
Bones clawed out of their bodies
The slain of former times

In
Grip
Of daimon (wail)
Crept
From these fitful lungs

Your children will answer
Answer for your crimes
Your children will answer
Fate won't be denied

In
Grip
Of daimon (wail)
Crept
From these fitful lungs

Feigned, no longer wanted
Counterfeit design
Mourn your simulation
Fate won't be denied (won't be denied)

Feigned, no longer wanted
Counterfeit design (won't be denied)
Mourn your simulation
Fate won't be denied (won't be denied)

Bones clawed out of their bodies
Failed mortal designs
Bones clawed out of their bodies
The slain of former times

In
Grip
Of daimon (wail)
Crept
From these fitful lungs

// Crimson Stone //

Compass rose
Pricking you
Bleed a map of stars
Battle wounds
Blood we drew
Busy making scars
Mess with it
Confess to it
Fate already knows
Tracing us
Embracing us
Where a flower grows

Stand in the way and fate will simply go around
Forces at play flipping worlds upside down
Trembling souls shaken into piles of bone
Blood running cold before it hardens into stone

Dragging on
Time and space
Face the black mirror
Moving hands
Glacial pace
Reflections nearer
Ravaging
Disparaging
Fate will split the earth
Falling in
This hole again
Dying sense of worth

Stand in the way
Stand in the way and fate will simply go around
Forces at play
Forces at play flipping worlds upside down
Trembling souls
Trembling souls shaken into piles of bone
Blood running cold
Blood running cold before it hardens into stone

Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone

Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone
Crimson stone

// Blood Dawn //

Cast first light on
Blood of the dawn
Cast first light on
Blood of the dawn

(And the blood moon will guide us through)
Blood red moon
(And the blood moon will guide us through)
Will guide you on

Questions unsaid
Free you from all you held
From ire comes peace
Ire lead me

(And the blood moon will guide you through)
The blood red moon
(And the blood moon will guide you through)
Will guide you on
(And the blood moon will guide you through)
The blood red moon
(And the blood moon will guide you through)
Will guide you on

Blood moon
Blood moon
