// Look Back //

You've taken these chances and don't expect a change
You better not look back now, you're well on your way
You've gotten everything, you've taken too much to protect
You look at me, what do you expect

For me to stand for you
And help you along the way?
For me to stand by you
But did you ever think?

Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back

You've taken these chances and don't expect a change
You better not look back now, you're well on your way
You've gotten everything, you've taken too much to protect
You look at me, what do you expect

(Did you ever know)

Did you ever think
You would have to crawl
Did you ever think
You could handle it all

Look back
Look back
Look back
Look back

Look back
[?] look back
[?] look back
[?] look back
[?] look back
Look back

// Open Your Eyes //

Don't tell anyone sorry, just tell yourself
Just because you're sober doesn't mean you're someone else
You don't make it all better, it doesn't work
Can't you see the damage you've done will always fucking hurt?

(Open your eyes)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
The one you hate the most
Has the same look in her eyes
Open your eyes (sometimes)
Open your eyes (sometimes)

Don't tell anyone sorry, just tell yourself
Just because you're sober doesn't make you someone else
You don't make it all better, it doesn't work
Can't you see the damage you've done will always fucking hurt?

Sometimes it helps to yell out
What's inside if no one hears
There's nothing left behind
No writing on the wall
Nothing etched in stone
The emotions are for me
And myself alone
Don't tell me you feel
Your sympathy isn't real
Hollow gumption
You're forced to take too much inbreeding
I knew you were a mistake

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes (open your fucking eyes)

(Open your eyes)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
The one you hate the most
Has the same look in her eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Welcome to the real fucking world

You say you're so sorry
You don't know what sorry is

// Blind //

In retrospect I reflect but I am to blind to see.
I embrace my soul hoping it will show me all.
Blind. I've lost it all. I've lost you.
I'm so sorry for what I have put you through.
I am so sorry for what I did to you.
But look at me, look at what I have put me through.
Taken for a ride.

// Gravel //

What I see, where it went, traveled through consequence
No mistake, different views turn over on the choose
Different outlook, different lies drown in my despise
A conversation, deafened shout, I've been blind and bound

Gravel is my life
It shows me truth
Gravel holding me down
Gravel holding us down

Gravel

Back down, fallout, one motherfucker down
One thing dragging me down through the ground
This life, the meaningless life is like gravel in the hand
Why don't you tell me what you stand for
So confident in who you are
You're another piece of gravel
Gravel is nothing, gravel is you

You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself
You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself
You can't tell me who you are
Even when you know yourself

Gravel controlling me

Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel

Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
Gravel
