// The Moment //

There's a moment when you find out
Who your true friends are
The ones who don't go by everyone elses ways

And its important to realize who your
One and true love is
And to not look back on yesterday's

Don't be asking what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive some how
Cause you do you better than anyone here
So mark this as your year

Tomorrow I'm going on that train
And I'm gonna pretend that it doesn't stop
Cause I'm taking all my fears an making them my destination
Bottom all the way to the top
Don't be asking what this world needs now
I need to see what makes me come alive some how
Cause I do me better than anyone here
So mark this as my year

Don't be asking what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
Cause I do me better than anyone here this is my year
I have no fear cause all my obstacle's are clear

// I Suck At Writing Lyrics //

Its 10 p.m. and I am missing
My seventh song for December second
My minds gone blank
I can not think clear
About the lyrics
for this God damn song here

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

It's 12 a.m. and I am so screwed
Looking up at people falling on YouTube
Getting so bored to the highest degree
This much be so easy for Kenny G

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

Another sappy love song
My listeners will be pissed
I would seriously pay someone
Right now to go and help me with this

Da da da da da da da
This is the chorus line
Da da da da da da da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics

I suck
At writing lyrics

How do people have enough
Motivation to go and do this
Feels like a day in this chair
And I haven't written down shit
Feel like I'm running out of ideas
For all these pieces
And every time I try to get done
Procrastination increases

Da da da da da da da
This is the chorus line
Da da da da da da da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics

// I Don't Wanna Hurt You Baby (Acoustic) //

Ohh
Yeah

I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I see you walkin' over there with all your friends
Eyein' me down but remember what you said to me
We've been on and off for a couple months now
Feelin' ok about it all but baby somehow
You keep coming back to me
The last thing I wanna do is leave again
And end up bringin' you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playin' these games
I've broken your heart and caused you so much pain
All I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on, yeah
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Girl, even though you do it better than anyone else
Staying with me ain't no good for your health
That way I don't have to explain why
For all it's worth at least we gave it a try
Please believe in me cause
The last thing I wanna do is leave again
And end up bringin' you down
Cause you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playin' these games
I've broken your heart and caused you so much pain
And all I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more, yeah

Remember when I told you
"That I'll love til day is done
You're the one that makes me happy"
God, what have I done?

Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on, yeah
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I don't wanna hurt you baby, baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Yeah, baby, I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
I don't wanna hurt you like I did before

// Next To You //

Ohh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Right next to you

You're the kind of person I remember seeing before
You're pretty face is one that I'll always adore
You have the eyes that'll close whenever you kiss me
Because love makes us whatever we want to be

How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're infront of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Right next to you

When I saw you on that richside on that one particular day
I was really hoping and wondering if you'd ever look my way
So I got up from my seat but you had already passed me by
If only I got there earlier and not lost in your eyes

How do I breath?
How do I sleep?
With you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're infront of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Right next to you

I'll promise one I'll be
And maybe one day you'll see
That you belong to me
Baby, baby

I don't know what to do
And it only helps when I'm singing right next to you
Sitting right next to you

Da-da-doooo

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you

Da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Right next to you...

// Time Passes By //

Oh-oh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo

I'm sitting here alone again
Waiting for you to come see me now
As time passes by
In the blink of an eye
I know I'll get to see you somehow

You are sitting home another night
Waiting for someone to hold you tight
Time passes by
So quick indeed
This time you're slipping away from me

It's been a long, cold, hard winter
It was a long, drawn-out spring
I took no wrong when you saw nothing in me
But our love was something nice to see

We were sitting alone on the beach
Letting all the sand between our feet
As time passes by
Blink of an eye
Amazing how things ain't what they used to be
Ain't what they used to be...

It was the shortest summer
The fall was so abrupt
Thought you'd be happy with the way things were
But I guess it wasn't enough

I am outside sitting, writing this song
You could have guessed that all along
Time passed me by
So quick indeed
And you're the thing that I'm missing

I wrote this song all last night
Tried to make the lyrics fit just right
But I'm stilling having trouble with this very last part
But I know it'll come from my heart
But I know it'll come from my heart...

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

// I Don't Wanna Hurt You Baby //

Yeah, yeah
See I've been thinkin' lately, baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

I see you walking over there with all your friends
Eyein' me down
But remember what you said to me, to me
We've been on and off for a couple months now
Feeling okay 'bout it all
But baby somehow
You keep coming back to me (leave me)

The last thing I wanna do is leave again and end up bringing you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playing these games
I've broken your heart and caused so much pain
And all I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Girl, even though you do it better than anyone else
Staying with me ain't no good for your health
Made lots of mistakes, so I'm not the only one, don't have to be this way
That way I don't have to explain why
For all it's worth, at least we give it a try
Please believe me, 'cause

The last thing I wanna do is leave again and end up bringing you down
And you can't just come around
I don't wanna keep playing these games
I've broken your heart and caused so much pain
All I've gotta say is

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It breaks my heart when you once said that
"You're my one and only
And I'll love you till day is done
You're the one that makes me happy"
God, what have I done?

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more (no more, no more)
So it's best that we move on (no more)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you baby, no more
So it's best that we move on (yeah)
I don't wanna hurt you baby
