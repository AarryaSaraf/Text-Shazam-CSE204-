Album: WhatHappensNext

// Where The Nightingale Sings //

Turn you back on London's bitter pride
In melancholic isolation
Force-feed yourself sentimentality
With golden age mythology
A feudal lord doesn't live no more
But in the night, the ravens call

False memories, fake history
Next you'll talk of racial purity

[Chorus:]
When the nightingale sings
The knights around all cleave close
You were abiding
Well your name is not

Always one, simple relations
Walk away from anonymity
The fedual lords are rutheless no more
But in the night the ravens call

(Force-feed yourself sentimentality)

False memories, fake history
False memories
Fake history
Next you'll talk of racial purity

[Chorus:]
When the nightingale sings
The knights around all cleave close
You were abiding
Well your name is not

(Force-feed yourself sentimentality)

[Chorus x2:]
When the nightingale sings
The knights around all cleave close
You were abiding
Well your name is not

// Broken Talk //

He's not a machine
But he's processing that code
Intermittent contacts
Arc as he overloads
You trust in fate
You trust in fate

[Chorus:]
He don't know
He don't sleep at night
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)

(He's talking, broken talk)
(He's talking, broken talk)

Where does he come from?
He's got an itch that won't be scratched
Sometimes he guesses he might be wrong
Sometimes, guesses that he don't belong
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate
But he checks out by days
Redeemer of coupons in a lonely mall

[Chorus:]
He don't know
He don't sleep at night
(He's talking, broken talk)
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)

[?]
Getting ill
Shakes by the steady
Self-medicator
It may come too late
Detereorating
Will he recuperate
It may come too late
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate

[Chorus x2:]
He don't know
He don't sleep at night
(He's talking, broken talk)
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)

(He's talking, broken talk)
(He's talking, broken talk)

// Isle Of Dogs //

They call me obscene
There's just no empathy
But I'm at the top of the world
No one looks down on me
From commercial road
To the old city
Every day we invent
The economy

[Chorus:]
I look around, and I'm pleased
And I buy into everything I see
I buy in, I buy in
Into everything I see
Buy into everything
Into everything

I don't need to be liked
But join me on my journey
Sweet Thames run soft
'Til I end my story
Past the island of dogs
The river flows to the sea
The cradle of our wealth
She carries lovingly

[Chorus:]
I look around, and I'm pleased
And I buy into everything I see
I buy in, I buy in
Into everything I see
Buy into everything
Into everything

Let forgiveness be heard
I can change
Let forgiveness be heard

// England's In My Bones //

Just like you, I was born alone
I'm like you but I'm unknown
I stand here gutted, talking to myself
England is in my bones

Windows broken at my home
Dela says there's something I stole
Bring me my bow, a bird in gold
You don't know how slow the hours go

England's in my bones
England's in my bones

I've come to the end of the road
No one taught me to think like me
Don't have no rules, make it up on my own
Don't believe any more than I see

Got nothing in my bag
Nothing I control
Just a sex-text on my phone
Bring me my spear, [?] unfold
God, you don't know how slow the hours go

England's in my bones
England's in my bones

England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones

// The Dying Rays //

Stop the seconds flow
Oh, I'm too late
I'm back where I began at the start
I'm caught in the wake
I'll have my due and drag the rock up the hill
Nothing to lose that's not been lost
I wish the sun anchored still

What I wanted disappears in the haze
A speck of dust held forever in the dying rays

Breath on the mirror; nothing inside
The horizon's bare, but in the night, I miss the pilot's light

Control and power, empires were built in our minds
But it will all go up in a blaze; only dust in the dying rays

// First World Citizen //

She walked out of the station in flames
Crossed over the 38th parallel, hitched, made a ride to the west

Big appetites, those American guys
Chew up whatever the dollar buys

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen

She will take up all your checks, no respect
I will work all the hours in the day
When they say "jump," they wanna hear "how high?"

I have lost everything
Didn't ask for anything
I would take anything, anything at all

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen

I have lost everything
Didn't ask for anything
I would take anything, anything at all

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen

// Dead Souls //

I'm a dissident; I say what we say is true
It's not, but we avow our sins
We saw it as the creed; I'm an alien hiding
Among the worker bees

The story's told
We'll be rats in a fight
I see in time
We are dead before we die

Well, they make the laws to keep control
But in the end, I'll join the line of dead souls

The shrink explains: I'm dysfunctional or ill
Just by some other name
I'm not cut out for this role
And in the end, I join the line of dead souls

Because those died without ever living
We only take what we are given

It was rushing by, everyone's on the run
And I pass the time in the line of dead souls

Well, they make the laws to keep control
But in the end, I'll join the line of dead souls
