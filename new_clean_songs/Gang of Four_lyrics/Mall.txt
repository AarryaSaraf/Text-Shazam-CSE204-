Album: Mall

// Cadillac //

All the boys are loving all the girls
Who screen the sun, can't stand the rain
Moving under not over time
The sun will shine on

Red rust wreck is off his mind
Down on the highway there to die
Got a Toyota of another kind
God built these hands to drive

Plastic bag woman must wait
While nylon men walk out in space
Africa will turn to dust
In LA LA land we give out trust

We'll set the place on fire
And watch the memories fry
Go someplace don't recognise
You can't lose if you don't try
Ain't gonna slave for a cadillac
Turn my back, burn the place to ash
I can't speak so I don't mime
I won't seek so I won't find

Who needs the pyramids
We got a photograph
Down on the left hand side
You can see mum and dad

Pull down the monuments
And send a postcard back
For nineteen ninety five
I will have the starter pack

My M16 was in my prayers:-
'How is the world now I ain't there?
Are they wearing flowers in their hair?'
The rich kids school while I am here

We'll set the place on fire
And watch the memories fry
Go someplace don't recognise
You can't lose if you don't try
Ain't gonna slave for a cadillac
Turn my back, burn the place to ash
I can't speak so I don't mime
I won't seek so I won't find

This map shows where to start
Move across the grid and down
When the lines are far apart
You will find you're out of town

At ninety miles an hour
Insects crash into the screen
The rear view mirror blurs
Home is just a memory

Aeroplanes fall from the skies
Liferafts sinking in the night
It stops if I close my eyes
Memories will hold me tight
Memories will hold me tight
Memories will hold me tight

// Motel //

Don't feel like eating, I don't wanna drink
All I need is a handkerchief to keep out the stink
Don't feel like sleeping, I don't wanna dream
All I need is a hit to cut the bullshit

Look at the cars parked in the motel
And nobody in them
They must be hungry as hell
They're feeding on ambition

Now watch this! - It's an adult movie
She's going down on him
Now hear this! - The third caller will win
Tickets to go to the wall

Don't want to lie, but I don't know what's true
All I need is to have something I can choose
Don't want to win, I'm not aiming to lose
All I need is a thought that I can use

Somebody promised some peace in sometime
It wasn't meant to be funny
I guarantee someone, somewhere,
Is taking somebody's opinions

Now watch this! - It's an adult movie
She's going down on him
Now hear this! - The third caller will win
Tickets to go to the wall

// Satellite //

I wake up you are there
Silhouette against the glare
Electric skin shocks me like lightning

You say to me: I give you this 
You can have all you can kiss
If it tastes good prove it to me

Shoot me up - I'm your moon
Turn me round coming soon

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...

Lost in space, the robot writes:
Don't wanna be a satellite
Empires falling down like ninepins

Shoot me up - I'm your moon
Turn me round coming soon

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...

In your face
I can see
I can be
Anyone
I can be

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...

// F.M.U.S.A. //

I lived in tunnels
Sometimes there was no rice and the water was bad
I was married, and very happy
My husband was just a regular guy, but he was killed
In my room, light from a light bulb
Smoke from fire
I think of Sony and Toyota
I see smiling faces, nights without fear
Holding a man who won't be gone when day comes
I dream too, Yankee

On R&R here comes a walking paycheque
Back from the front, he's going to have some fun
Holding rubbers and a gun
The grunt will grunt & the girl will take a raincheck
He ain't going to be the first
G.I. on a two day pass
A G-string separates the words
Writ in lipstick across her ass

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

In this freefire zone he wants to be unseen
Acid, junk, and speed help his heart freeze
He wants a woman to do him on her knees
Says "No blue eyed blondes back home believe in me"

He needs the gook girl
While she spills his seed
She says "If I weren't doing you I'd be V.C."

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

Yo. I come from Detroit. Motor City? Yeah.
I never had nothing.
Shit. Probably won't live that long
It's the Brothers get most combat missions
Putting our asses on the line
While all the rich kids finish college
But we party
Yeah we get R + R.
We party seriously man 
Stoned out of our fucking trees
Hunting that Saigon Poontang,
You know what I mean
Them bitches are fucking wild.

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee

// Don't Fix What Ain't Broke //

I want tomorrow today
I didn't think that I'd
Have yesterdays all week on someone else's time

Yeah, I like that car
Suppose the colour's OK
Fibre glass and rust are filling in my day

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

Repossess my heart
I gave it away
A loan is all
But nothing lasts forever these days

Got a stereo, 100 watts a side
Its matt black face is laughing at my life

I wanna see the starlight, in the day time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

I want to see the sunrise in the night time
I'm gonna fake... an alibi

Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)
Don't fix what ain't broke
Don't fix what ain't broke
(Not now)

// Impossible //

Can't catch it again, can you?
Can't catch it again, can you?

I think I'm getting it back again
I think I'm getting it back again

I'm getting a headache

Mutated/Transmogrified
Mutated/Transmogrified

// Money Talks //

Innocents all, kept in the dark
Centre cannot hold, things fall apart
Sex and death walk hand in hand
And Elvis's body will never be found
Put another quarter in the bandit machine
And then you come alive in the Vegas Dream

I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the groove's our only guide
In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

(U.S. forces in defence of democracy)
(Sounds complicated!)

Aliens are born in space, but make their base in Russia
The curtain tears, but Bush don't care
Fights on like General Custer
Marines maintain control
The newspaper said you can weigh the human soul
Here's the dope on Noriega's jones
A pineapple on the U.S. payroll

I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the bible belts are tightening
I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the groove's our only guide
In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

// Soul Rebel //

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See the morning sun on the hillside
Not living good, travel wide.
Said I'm a living man; I got work to do
If you're not happy children, then you must be blue

People say:
I'm a rebel, soul rebel = talk don't bother me
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

Said I'm a living man; I got work to do
If you're not happy children, then you must be blue
Said if you're not happy childrenm, then you must be blue
(If you're not happy you must be blue)

People say:
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

People say:
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
I'm a rebel, soul rebel = talk don't bother me
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

// Hiromi & Stan Talk //

Le monde arabe etait, pour nous, un lieu de passions incontrollees, une colonie que nous pouvions seulement controle par la force
Les plus grandes artistes francais ont fantasme sur les harems, une fuite de la sexualite bourgeoise enchainee.

// Colour From The Tube //

Now that everything is true
I believe in me and you
What I see in magazines
I believe in everything

I believe in politics
When we're playing pick up sticks
I believe in five year plans
I believe it in advance

I believe in innocence
College boys wash your hands!
I believe in one night stands
No-one gets a second chance

I believe that dogs are bit
Even fakes are counterfeit
I believe the BBC
I believe in everything

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else to do

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else that you can do
(There is nothing else that you can do)

Now that everything is real
I believe I really feel
Even hear the churchbells ring
I believe in everything

I believe in Postman Pat
I'll leave my kidneys to the bank
I believe in even tans
I believe in everything

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else to do

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else for you to do
(There is nothing else for you to do)

// Hey Yeah //

Who is wanting to be perfect?
Too many angels in heaven
You're looking at a road block
At least my fingerprints are mine

Hey yeah, we got it all
Refugees come flooding in
Sell them all our cigarettes
And send them home like friends

If I can't find truth, justice, happiness
I'm wanting the new, show me something else
(Show me something else)

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

Maybe the earth's still got an edge
Who cares if it's second hand
Salmonella in the batteries
This car is from Japan

If I can't find truth, justice, happiness
I'm wanting the new, show me something else
(Show me something else)

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you said

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

(Yeah yeah...)
(Yeah yeah...)
(Yeah yeah...)

// Everybody Wants To Come //

We're not moving, we're going slow
There's bodies at the side of the road

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

I'm alive, I'm not dead
I like to watch, it's better than getting head

Listen up, to hear the guns
Sex charged barrels, pump action

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

Turn the page, to see the face
The vacant eyes are staring into space

Don't need no one, I got the proof
For me to win someone else must lose

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

The sirens fade, the traffic speeds
I am free, I'm a lover, I am real

// World Falls Apart //

This sombitch nowhere's jewelled lights
Overflashing trade marks at war
"Hungry eat cake!" - "Thirsty Drink Cola!"
Piss stained boy slumps in a door

His hundred year old teenage eyes
Watch the lights chase green to red
Stuck to his head seed bun and fries
Waiting for the world to end

I'm gonna live right in your face
I'm gonna lie here while you play
Fuck you, yeah and fuck this place
Don't think you're chasing me away

Don't think you're better than I am
The music stops, your chair is gone
When they weigh the balance, man
You done no good and I done no wrong

I am the mess on your doorstep
You'll see me here until I die
Yeah, walk on by, look straight ahead
I'll be here till the whales can fly

The angel says: 'The gate's unlocked
But it ain't you must make amends
The rich guys try and beat the clock
Waiting for the sale to end -

Don't think they're better than you are
The music stops, their chair is gone
When they weigh the balance, man
They done no good and you done no wrong'

Yeah, I'm stopped in front of you
Waiting for the world to start
Yeah, I'm stuck at the front of the queue
Waiting till your world falls apart

My day begins when your party ends,
A booby trap in your bouquet
Dynamite in these happy times,
Valium for the mortgage rate
I'll cough in your face as the markets crash
I'll dog your steps from Pall Mall to The Strand
My time and place is real, yours incomplete
As we dream the future we make it wake

Yeah, I'm up at the front of the queue
And when you fall you'll fall just once
Yeah I'm up at the front of the queue
Waiting till your world falls apart
