// She Said "You Made A Thing Of Me" //

She is an accident
Her shape's coincidence
He said she's beautiful
An invention that is useable

She will collaborate
He will embrace her fate
You made a thing of me
Don't feel, won't kneel, don't ask, won't steal

She said you made a thing of me
That what I am is what you see

Jailers get Valentines
Kidnappers, overtime
We're lost in nursery rhymes
Lock down, talk sport
Don't walk, get caught

She said you made a thing of me
That what I am is what you see
She said you made a thing of me
That what I am is what you see

Dress and undress codes are read
Then later, when the child is bred
She thinks about what was never said
Well I was glad to take what I was fed, I was glad

The voice in her head said
Long ago we went to bed
The sleeping dog's not dead
He will bite if he's not fed

We got narcoticised
We're lost in nursery rhymes
We made a thing of us
No show, no loss, go slow, we're all bust

She said we made a thing of us
What we do is what we must
I said we made a thing of us
What we do is what we must
I said we made a thing of us
What we do is what we must
I said we made a thing of us
What we do is what we must

// You Don't Have To Be Mad //

I'm watching you step round the room
Show me the rabbit and watch me run,
When you're stripped and looking fun
You give me hope, it is a noose
Kiss and tell and don't regret,
I know that the line is dead
You're the one who asks for proof
You look good with no clothes on,
I'll take photos on my phone
I wish that I was in the loop!
You broker words like I knew you would
Feed me lies like they are food
Persuade me to jump through hoops
Disunited in a sweat, telling me to run and fetch

You're the one with the juice!
You're the one with the juice!
You think what you cannot name,
You want what you can't explain
You're the one with the juice!
You want what you can't explain,
You wish you could walk away

I wish that I was in the loop!
Dreaming that I got full house,
Never have to do without
Out of ten you are a nine
Show me the rabbit and I am fine,
Watching you walking the line
So here we are, it's closing time
I drank fast and you drank wine,
Back to your place, never mine
It's the scene of the crime, I'm off my tits!
One on one you are the chief,
Telling me what to believe
I wish that I was set loose!
Blind dates don't go like they should
Having patience, it's no good

You're the one with the juice!
You're the one with the juice!

// Who Am I? //

The pilgrim can't sleep The pilgrim's a spy!
The pilgrim can't sleep 'cause his prayers won't fly
The dumb won't speak The truth is lies!
The dumb won't speak make their tongues get fired
The cripple won't walk The crooks all cry
The cripple won't walk put the stilts on trial
The dead man talks Didn't say goodbye
The dead man talks and the phone is wired

Who can steal when everything is free?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

Betting on tilt I make a deal
When I get up I take a pill
Come on down and come on in
The little lambs jump and I could kill them still

Creationists creep They walk in the street!
Creationists creep and the citizens buy
All the shoppers asleep They're in way too deep!
All the shoppers asleep and the cameras lie

Who can lie when everything is true?
Who wants old when everything is new

Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

Betting on tilt I make a deal
When I get up I take a pill
Come on down and come on in
The little lambs jump and I could kill them still

Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

The little lambs jump and I could kill them still

// I Can't Forget Your Lonely Face //

You weren't around in the compound
Could not be found, had gone to ground
Hiding out in a public space, everyone was on display
I can't forget your lonely face

On your nights out, you danced alone
You loved the sights, the siren's moan
All the other losers dreaming of a break, everyone had been displaced
I can't forget your lonely face

Send me a picture of you on your escape
Send me a photo of you on holiday

I look at you, looking at me, can't come in here, with no ID
But when you're in you can have all you see,
Just got to reach up and pick from the tree

Just reach out pick fruit from the tree
Just reach out pick fruit from the tree

We are all broke, we celebrate
There's no punchline to jokes we make
We are not thin enough to fill in space, everything is in one place
I can't forget your lonely face

Send me a photo of you on holiday
Send me a photo of you on holiday

I look at you, you don't look like me, can't come in here, with no ID
But when you're in you can have all you see,
Just got to reach up and pick from the tree

Just reach out pick fruit from the tree
Just reach out pick fruit from the tree

Everything is in one place
Everything is in one place

// You'll Never Pay For The Farm //

You'll never pay for the farm
Someone should raise the alarm
I think you're losing your charm
You can't undo all the harm

You can't regret what you get
You can't get back what you bet
You can't divorce from your fate
You're lying drunk at the wake

You never wanted to live alone
But never share what you don't own
Don't want to die upon your feet
You always want to keep the receipt

You think you're a winner
But you'll never pay, you'll never pay for the farm
You think you're a winner
Change the locks, change your life

You're never able to rest
You can't get thoughts off your chest
I think you lost the romance
You walk around in a trance

You got no 'cause to have regrets
You stuffed your face and then you wept
You're dreaming of World War the Third
Between the Shi-ites & the Kurds

You think you're a winner. Change the locks,
Change your life. You think you're a winner
But you'll never pay, you'll never pay for the farm

You think you're a winner. Change the locks, change your life
You think you're a winner. But you'll never pay for the farm

What you steal is crap
What you steal is crap
You should send it all back
Married your mother, buried your father
Hated your brother, locked up your sister
Change your life. No need for a sacrifice

// I Party All The Time //

We are not prisoners - although we're putting in the hours
We are not innocent - although we're singing in the choir
If there's a revolution then you'll stay at home
You want to pay the ransom but don't know who to phone
If there should be a rapture you won't get chose
If there's an invitation, you won't get told!

Every night you dress as lover's bait
Give yourself to someone that you hate

I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
I'm a party to the crime
I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
And I party all the time

You're not a candidate - but you always have opinions
You're not a volunteer - although it ended in conscription

If there's a revolution don't know who to phone
Although you paid a ransom you won't go home
If there should be a rapture you won't get chose
If there's an invitation, you won't get told!

Every day you wish you could repent
Give back all the favours you were lent

I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
I'm a party to the crime
I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
And I party all the time
And I party all the time

I'm not innocent
I'm not innocent. I'm a phoney
And I party all the time

I'm not innocent. I'm a phoney
And I party all the time
And I party all the time
And I party all the time
And I party all the time

// A Fruitfly In The Beehive //

Where did it all begin? Where's the proof of life? Who is on my side?
Is there a blind man's guide? Can I hitch a ride when the lifeboats slide?
Don't know if what I know is true, what's the golden rule, where am I going to?
All the workers do what they do, they're applauding too, and the sky is blue

And when the true believers die, more and more get born again
If the Queen can't cope at all, there's a number she can call

What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life, a fruitfly in the beehive
I quit spinning the plates for you, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive

Where are we headed for? For a distant shore? Or some brand new war?
Don't know why I can't ask for more, don't walk out the door, what am I left here for?
How is it gonna end? Should I now repent and then make amends?
Who wrote the unwritten laws that we didn't ask for but we can't ignore?

And when the true believers die, more and more get born again
If the Queen can't cope at all, theres a number she can call

Wanting some proof of life, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life, fruitfly in the beehive
I quit spinning the plates for you, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive

// It Was Never Gonna Turn Out Too Good //

It was never gonna turn out too good for me
I was born in the winter in Manchester 3
With the rain in my face
From the East came the men that meant I'd never work again

They do the work that you won't
If this is Jerusalem why do they speak in tongues
Bring me your poor your masses
It was never gonna turn out too good for me
That always happens to your kind
I'm in the heart of the storm and it's too dark to see
It's fixed in the stars how it will be

I look to the stars to see how it unwinds
I never called the shots and I know that's my lot
The world will end in fire or it will end in ice
My fortunes depend on the throw of a dice

Wish it weren't so
Say it ain't so
A mountain to climb
It's too far to go

// Do As I Say //

Whet the blade on the stone, light the fire from the flint
I confess to all of my crimes, tell me more and I'll repeat your lines
You're not natural, you're not as God made you, do as I say, do as I do
Before I'm burned up in the flames, I will give you all the Devil's names?

Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do!

The rod to your back I'll use 'til it's broken, you say you re innocent so you must be guilty!
You serve me ill Sir, there's nothing to find, need some face time, need some quality time
I will cleave the soul from the flesh, I am unmoved as you confess!
Look in this glass, we are the same, if we reversed then you'd be in the flames

Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do!

Please... Say as I say! Please...
Please... Say as I say! Please... Do as I say!

Burn at the stake! Die for a break!
Lose all I stake! Kill all the day!
She wore some lipstick! She should've covered it!
They dress In dayglo robes In Guantanamo!

Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you

// I Can See From Far Away //

A face like that locked you in so that you lost all your friends

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake

How could she be your idol?
It was a fluke you first saw her
She was marooned in a shop door
But you forget how you met her

Everybody answers the bell
Everyone thinks they have no tell
Hoarding your fate, saving your skin, it never ends

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away, I can see you float away

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Oh, have Mercy

Don't ask me where she could be now
Or if her long hair is still brown
Her downy neck collects sweat beads
And if she captures the sunbeams

Everybody wants to be free
All you want is to be released
She opens her eyes, she swiveled her hips, did it all for you

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake.

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away, I can see you float away

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Oh, have Mercy

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away
