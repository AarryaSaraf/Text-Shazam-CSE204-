// Outside The Trains Don't Run On Time //

He's become nostalgic
Wants to own tomorrow
Discipline - is his passion
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's no coincidence
He thinks sunblock will track him down
Home - it's no castle
He wants his wife to run - and fetch
Order - he's obsessed with order order

Discipline - is his passion
Now - he says there's none
Order - his obsession
Order - his obsession
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's no coincidence
He thinks sunblock will track him down
Home - it's no castle
He wants his wife - to run - and fetch
Order
The trains don't run on time

Nostalgia
Discipline
Is his passion
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time

// He'd Send In The Army //

The family's head gives orders
In the end, what he says goes
This system's well constructed
She owes him all she gets

The army has it's uses
In times of civil crisis
'Allo boys!Seen any action?
Hey boys, seen any...action?

Pull together with your mates
Against the common enemy
The Private's not born that way

The Private's not born that way
Guns take up all his time
With no job he'd be in a mess
Wanted action, gets some in

She pays him back in the bedroom
One step down from her leader
Obeys, or is punished
Like he obeys his bosses

// Paralysed //

Blinkered, paralysed
Flat on my back

They say our world is built on endeavor
That every man is for himself
Wealth is for the one that wants it
Paradise, if you can earn it

History is the reason
I'm washed up

Blinkered, paralysed
Flat on my back

My ambitions come to nothing
What I wanted now just seems a waste of time
I can't make out what has gone wrong
I was good at what I did

And I'm the dupe

// What We All Want //

This wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it

You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

This wheel spins letting me off
These doubts and nagging worries
Nothing to work towards

This demon on my back
Preaches the razors cut
The hope that does not fade

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

This wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it

You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

What we want's not what we get

// If I Could Keep It For Myself //

If I could keep it for myself
What did you say I am confused
I don't remember what did we do last week
Can you imagine in the dark
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
It was hot then it was cold
The view imagined in the dark
My heart sticking to my ribs
Your back's clammy with the heat
If I could keep it for myself
Can you imagine in the dark
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
It was hot and it was cold
The view imagined in the dark
My heart was sticking to my ribs
Your back clammy with the heat
If I could keep it for myself [4x]
What did you say I am confused
I don't remember what I didn't do last week
Everything has been cynically shot it's gone
Are there no surprises anymore?
If I could keep it for myself

// Why Theory? //

We've all got opinions.
Where do they come from?
Each day seems like a natural fact,
And what we think changes how we act.

We've all got opinions.
Where do they come from?
Distant thunder from the east
Won't disturb a morning car wash.

Each day seems like a natural fact,
And what we think changes how we act.
So to change ideas changes what we do.

Too much thinking makes me ill.
I think I'll have another gin.
A few more drinks and it'll be all right.

Each day seems like a natural fact,
And what we think changes how we act.
Each day seems like a natural fact.
Each day seems like a natural fact.
Each day seems like a natural fact.
Each day seems like a natural fact.

// Cheeseburger //

(I need a cheeseburger to go)

I move from one place to the next
I hope they keep down the price of gas
I shoot fast while you talk dollars
See how I will run the table
I won't see my dollar go where they rig it
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

The last cent is coming out of his head
To be honest or a son like his own
And all this changed we're sure of the rides
The old country's in the back of his mind
I hope his home is somewhere you go to sleep
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

No classes in the u s of a
Improve yourself the choice is yours
Work at your job you can make it pay
Make friends quick buy them beer
You never know when you're gonna lose them
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

I'm at the wheel of the company truck
On the road and all alone
Sometimes I think money is my only goal
It makes me sad
Work on up another four miles
Coffee fries and a cheeseburger

// The Republic //

Make the grade in our republic
We all are loyal subjects
The paper stirring dregs of no great causes
Action is none of my business

I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store

Better take smaller chances
And bugger with the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stick

Nationals in our republic
We all see the same subject
Each day we reason up some other causes
Action is none of my business

I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store

Better take smaller chances
And bugger with the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stick

Know your place in our republic
Talk of the future is our main subject
Rations - we'd like more but we make less noises
Action is none of my business

I'm unconcerned with what's in store
(I don't give a shit what's in store)
I'm unconcerned with what's in store

Better take smaller chances
And bugger the consequences
Between the insults whirr and click
Connections made - some stick

// In The Ditch //

Heads down, down to the floor
Run past the windows and close the door
Whatever you do stay calm
Show me a ditch and I'll dive it
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world

Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under

Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor

Get down down to the floor
Under the table with the radio on
Whatever you do stay calm
The cupboard is stocked, the door is locked
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world

Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under

Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor

Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
Show me a ditch and I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it

Heads down, down to the floor
Run past the windows and close the door
Whatever you do stay calm
Show me a ditch and I'll dive it
I'll feel safe beyond the cares of the world

Good news is prospect
Excluding the six feet under

Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor
Marshall music the beat goes on
Get down down to the floor

I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it
I'll dive in it

// A Hole In The Wallet //

Education is their business
Women to know that they are equal

Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting time a hole in the wallet

There is only one condition
Stay in bed or in the kitchen

Better not (you'll only earn emotional losses)
Disrupt their passions

Mirror reflect their teaching
Make up makes up for your nature

Make up makes up for your nature
You're for seeing and not for hearing
Their commands are in your interest

Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting times a hole in the wallet

Their commands are your interest
There is only one condition
You're for seeing and for the taking

Why work for love if it shows no profit
You'll only earn emotional losses
Wasting times a hole in the wallet

Better not (you'll only earn emotional losses)
Disrupt their passions

Education is their business
Women to know that they are equal
There is only one condition
Stay in bed or in the kitchen
