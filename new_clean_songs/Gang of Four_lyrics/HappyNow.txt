Album: HappyNow

// Toreador //

See me drive, catch the light in my car
I'm breaking all the rules
I disappear, I'm gonna reappear
In a puff of smoke, I'm here
In my despair in the maze
I curse the way she holds my gaze
Where you been? Missing you
And we've got so much catching up to do

Can you hear me now? I've been missing you
And we've got so much catching up to do
Look in my eyes, show me your respect
There's things I want to forget

Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door

Let's celebrate me!
I'm bound, but I believe I'm free
You diggin' me? I'm your friend, family
You must never stop talking about me
Pocket dolly, plastic fork
Cappuccino foam
I get all the air in the room
'Cause that's my home

Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door
Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door

Get into me, friendly
Let's explore my sexuality
Lying in filth
Since 1000 BC
I never said, I never said
That I was a people person

// Alpha Male //

All unplanned
All unplanned

There you go

And I'm at the top of the tree
If you're an Alpha Male like me
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
Magic Mirror, where do we go?
And was this all unplanned
Or are we heading for the Fatherland?

Night vision sex, for all your tomorrows
Yearning, shame and sorrow
If you've been affected by stories, depraved
There's help online for all the issues raised

What you praying for?
What you praying for?

British and American rats
Take meetings with Russian diplomats
There on the floor, in the urine pool
As a fully waxed Klaus Barbie drools

So sad, so pathetic

You don't know what you're missing

Then I awoke, but it was no dream
Ministers, oligarchs and showgirls were all with me
In a steam room with the deep fake tans
Clinging to the shipwrecks of our lives and all our plans

All unplanned
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
All unplanned
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
All unplanned
Where do we go?
All unplanned
Where do we go?

Magic Mirror, where do we go?
And was this all unplanned
Or are we heading for the Fatherland?

Then I awoke, but it was no dream
Ministers, oligarchs and showgirls were all with me
In a steam room with the deep fake tans
Clinging to the shipwrecks of our lives and all our plans

// One True Friend //

Well I'm your one true friend
Ask of me anything
Ask of me what you want
I'll take you by the hand

We learn from what you know
Harvest the seeds you sow
Start your thought, I'll take it
Where it needs to go

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name

You know I'll help you out
With anything
Run my fingers through your hair
We don't know who we are
The genie's left the jar
To what do you aspire?
I can help us get what we require

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name

// Ivanka: 'My Names On It' //

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Where once were her eyes
Ivanka now sees through pearls
She said I don't know
What it means to be complicit
Be complicit

Need to believe
You got to understand
Need to believe
You got to understand

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

I saw how hard daddy worked for his money
Daddy loves women and he believes in family
Need to believe, you gotta understand

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
(Given to me)
Given to me

In the morning daddy wants me in his room, it's where we get together
It's not true that daddy calls my name in stormy weather

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Mr. Putin said to Daddy "Russian prostitutes are the best"
Then Daddy walked into a Moscow hotel room, y'all know the rest (A long way from home)

Now we're a long way from home (A long way from home)
Now we're a long way from home
You need to know I'll do my best for you

// Don't Ask Me //

Null null zero one
Shows me my life rerun
Like stupid jokes
From my favourite comedian
We made laws and bank accounts
Invented God
To tell the women what it's all about
What it's all about

We can escape the web
Don't let the monsters follow you to bed
Feed them, treat them lovingly
Then later on let them all walk free
Let them all walk free

It's not the world as you might want it
But it is what you see
And if you don't get it
Why are you asking
Why'd you keep asking me?

Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask me

Stand to attention, there's work to be done
My border guards with their sub-machine guns
Sub-machine guns
It's right and it's popular and now it's time for fun
The good times have only just begun
Only just begun

It's riotously funny
I laughed myself into an early grave
As I look down on the little world
Does anyone expect to be saved?

Powerful while men rule the world
Uphold democracy
But I keep giving the wrong answers
So don't bother asking, don't ask me

// Change The Locks //

Indiscernible identity
So many passing by, she seems
Silver sprayed living statue
She stands watching the absurdity

The idea of self is a placebo
Run the data, it knows where you go
I'm a construct
Oh I'm a suspect but don't want it known

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

Do what you want, you won't be found out
You'll never be held to account
We're just getting static on the line
A broken voice says everything's fine

You and a friend could be our guest
At our request, come and fine dine
It's our gift for you to celebrate
The last of the mall's great redesign

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Change the locks, don't change the plan
They're applauding me but [?]

The kings of comedy
The kings of comedy

Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang but we just didn't see it

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

// I'm A Liar //

Need to make friends
Seems I was someone else
But now I'm truly me
That's what many seem to believe
Transform yourself
Secrets take vacations
Fact and fiction are in the mixture
But you don't need a diagram to get the picture

They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must
They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must

Sold your story
But that's not what gets told
Don't waste time, don't repent
Can't pack the bags and leave
We're addicted too. On which we're weaned
Connections fail, collectives dissolve
So we invented celebrity

They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must
They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must

// White Lies //

Before we begin
I ask, please listen to me
Time destroys empires
But not empires of the heart

If it makes me happy
If it makes me happy
If it feels this good to me
I imagine what I see

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
Until the end of the night

Hold back the dawn
For dawn will break everything
Everything that matters

If it makes me happy
If it makes me happy
If it feels this good to me
In the mirror, what do I see?

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
Until the end of the night

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
But in truth it's not over

// Paper Thin //

Call for history, the past is dark
They make it up as they like
We put down a flag, we put down a line in the sand

I had no innocent mind
It's not hidden, it's there to find
They don't own the past, they say that the future glows

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
We await the next message to enter within
The future looked good but in space we spin
Everything was solid, but now it's all paper thin

You have an opinion
Confrontation, us and them
Just because you move your mouth don't mean a debate

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
Can't stop the endless messages pouring in
The clouds fill the sky and as the light dims
Moving so fast but everything is paper thin

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
We await the next message to enter within
The future looked good but in space we spin
Everything was solid, but now it's all paper thin

Everything is paper thin

// Lucky //

You work hard, you pay your dues
Play by the rules but still you lose
Stick or twist, I hold my nerve
Nobody ever gets what they deserve

All the years is a long time
But what costs the most is free (It's free)
I'm a double-jointed conman
I specialize in mimicry (Mimicry)

When I look at my life
I see how I've been used
I'll never pay back the money I spent
Never return the favours I was lent

Some have no luck with luck
But I'm a lucky man
The cards I mark are the cards I choose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

We know what it's about
All your luck has run out
Leveraged your self-doubt
Chewed you up and spat you out

We can leave the scene of the crime
We can turn back time
We can change
Yeah, we can change our minds

Some have no luck with luck
But I'm a lucky man (He's a lucky man)
The cards I mark are the cards I choose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

Nothing's too special for you
We're here to help you through
Please say you won't refuse
But you got everything to lose

(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
I get what I can
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
'Cause I'm a lucky man
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
But I'm an also-ran
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
Oh, I'm a lucky man
