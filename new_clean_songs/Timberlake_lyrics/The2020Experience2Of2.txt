Album: The2020Experience2Of2

// Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want) //

The sounds are calm when we become the animals that were made in the jungle...

Why you standin' so far away?
Mindin' manners and lookin' on, by
Why don't you come out and play
And get closer to your animal, inside
Maybe I act like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Show me your teeth and then spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you're wild as a stray
Side show in front of the whole, crowd

Maybe I act like the gentleman that your momma would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, teach me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Sounds are calm when we become the animals that were made in the jungle...
(Give it to me now)

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don't taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

The sounds are calm...
(Give it to me now)
The sounds are calm...
(Give it to me now)

Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

// True Blood //

[4x]
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

[Verse 1]
Red was the color of her eyes
When she put me in a meditation states
Her skin was white, so white
Look like it had no expiration dates
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

[Bridge:]
Aw, give it to me now (so evil in the dress)
It circulates, you start to feel it (devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to invoke the spirits (got you on the floor)
She comes alive when you're the killing (hungry for some more)

[Hook:]
Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's the demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
[2x]
(It makes me say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type she told me that she found her perfect blood mate

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Rose me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna freak
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle (candle...)
Sometimes it feels like...
Smells so funky.
Guitar

Give it to me
Break
Smells so good

[Hook]

[4x]
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

Give it to me

[4x]
Start to think like an animal

Now that you got me
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
I taste your blood
And found out you was the perfect fit
Come on
Show me what you're working with
Come on mama
Go and show me what you're working with
Show me what you're working with

True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…

Now that you got me
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
'Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you were my perfect fit
Come on mama
Show me what you're working with
I said come on mama
Come on, show me what you're working with

You got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)
You got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)

[3x]
You got that (true blood)
She hit me with the (true blood)
You got that (true blood)
She hit me with the (true blood)

[2x]
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…

// Cabaret //

[Intro - Justin Timberlake:]
Hey, hey, hey
Come on
We are having too much fun right now

[Verse 1 - Justin Timberlake:]
She's got a secret but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

[Bridge - Justin Timberlake:]
Now can we discuss
How fast you just got undressed
Girl if sex is a contest then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow
I, I can't lie, I'm impressed
Than innovation encore
When lo curtains close

[Hook - Justin Timberlake:]
It's a cabaret
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
Cause even though I'm a professional
I like to do my work at home
Cabaret
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got
All I really want now is more

[Bridge - Justin Timberlake:]

[Verse 3 - Drake:]
Okay this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long till you get off from work
But listen I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance with no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
Your Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya
Girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know
I'll keep a secret for ya
I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep it soul stripping things slipping like a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O.
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

[Hook - Justin Timberlake:]

Baby, everyday you're training to get the gold

Girl I can see in your eyes that there's
Something inside that made you evil

'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out, what am I supposed to do?

I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low

This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody's heart is swollen
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside
That made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie

// Take Back The Night //

Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it?
Listen, uh

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, this was your city
You did it all and more, broke every law except for one, babe
Attraction, are you ready
I know you feel it
Pull you nearer 'til you feel it again, oh

[Bridge:]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain't no time like tonight
And we ain't trying to save it 'til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
You got that lil' something I like
A little something I've been wanting to borrow

Tonight the night's, come on surrender
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love's a weapon
Give your body some direction
That's my aim
Then, we could

[Chorus:]
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there's nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can't catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's

[Post-Chorus:]
Take back the night, take back the night
They gon' try to shut us down, I'll be damned if we gon' let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better

Take back the night, oh
Yeah

[Verse 2:]
Rare, there's not too many
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (yeah)
Attraction can drive you crazy
The way you move, you go crazy, that's incentive for me

[Bridge:]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better
Ain't no time like tonight
And we ain't trying to save it 'til later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
You got that lil' something I like
A little something I've been wanting to borrow

Tonight the night's, come on surrender
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love's a weapon
Give your body some direction
That's my aim
Then, we could

[Chorus:]
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there's nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can't catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's

[Post-Chorus:]
Take back the night, take back the night
They gon' try to shut us down, I'll be damned if we gon' let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better

[Middle 8:]
And the horns say, alright
And the horns say, alright
Uh, ooh, and the horns say, alright
And the horns say
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Take it over
Yeah, yeah

[Timbaland:]
Y'all ready to have a good time out there, ladies and gentlemen?

Take back the night, take back the night...

[Chorus:]
Take back the night

Take back the night
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's
Take back the night

// Murder //

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Walking around middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'mma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Chocha ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck

[Hook]

// Drink You Away //

Bitter sweet thing.
Could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain.
A tall shot of pain.
Pour a little OUT now for the love that we've made.

I feel it in the morning.
You're still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: I'm not okay.
The bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Don't change the truth.
I dive in but I can't.

I can't drink you away.
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends.
But I can't drink you away.
All these rocks
I can't swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break, ooh?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Got a pounding on my brain.
So I drowned it away.
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doing the same.
'Cause I just can't forget
The way we turned out this bad/bed.
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead.

And then I feel it in the morning.
You're still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone.
Telephone a doctor: I'm not okay.
Bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Don't change the truth.
I dive in but I can't.

I can't drink you away.
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends.
But I can't drink you away (no, I can't).
All these rocks
I can't swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

Tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break?
Oh, tell me, baby, one time, come on, don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Break it down

I can't drink you. No, I can't drink you away, away.
I can't drink you. I can't drink you away, away.
I can't drink you. I can't drink you away, away.
Oh, I can't drink you. No, I can't drink you away, away.

I can't drink you away.
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends.
But I can't drink you away.
All these rocks
I can't swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

So tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break (don't they, don't they, tell me, baby)?
Oh, tell me baby, one time, don't they make a medicine for heart break, yeah?

Tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heart break, heart break?
Tell me, baby, yeah, can't they make a medicine for my heart break?

'Cause I can't drink you away.
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of their friends.
I can't drink you away.
All these rocks
I can't swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.

// You Got It On //

(Listen...)

Now baby the day you were born
They picked you up and wrapped you, you up
So cold but so hot everything melts on you
It's cool you ain't got on nothing baby
Cause I know what to do, girl, let's coordinate, yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
First I take you out, then you turn around baby
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we're at our own place
So I take you home, wear wherever you want, baby
Cause I know that we're gonna end up back where we started

[Chorus:]
And you don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on, oh baby
Tell me what's better than the two us
Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don't think she heard me so I say
Oooh, baby you got it... on
I said ooh, baby you got it... on

Now everything you put on
Everything you put on looks better on you, than the one you tried on before
Don't make me pick girl, don't make me choose
Don't you feel like you're back in the twelfth grade
Now you're my first lady so let's take it back to our first date
This is what we do...

First I take you out, then you turn around baby
Then you back it up, ooh yeah, like we're at our own place
So I take you home, wear wherever you want, baby
Cause I know that we're gonna end up back where we started

And all I'm saying is you don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Those heels lift you up where you fit me right, said oh
You already got it on oh baby
Tell me what's better than the two of us
Cause you by yourself is more than enough for me
Honey, I don't think she heard me so I say
Oooh, baby you got it... on
I said ooh, baby you got it... on

[Bridge:]
And it sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love right now
It sounds like falling in love
Just like falling in love over and over again with you, oh baby

You don't gotta worry what you wear tonight
Baby you got it on
Tell me what's better than the two of us
Nothing baby you got it
I don't think she heard me so I say
I say ooh, baby you've got it on
I'm telling you mama
Ooh baby you've got it on

Don't matter what you wear
Baby you've got it on
And it sounds like falling in love

Sounds like falling in love
Sounds like falling in love
Yeah baby you got it on

// Amnesia //

[Verse 1:]
(Yeah, uh)
Keeps coming closer, I don't, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type, amnesia, that's over (uh)
I can see you breathing, girl, it's colder
I can see you need me but I don't care
My whole memory of me in love, gone so far from me, girl
It's not fair
I could feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much, that's when it starts to fade

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone.
But if it was true, if it was you
Don't you think, don't you think I would know?
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2:]
Now these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened?
Who were they? Where did they go?
When was enough, enough?
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love's gone so far from me, it's not fair
And I can feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But it just hurts too much, I've let it go away

(Oh, no)

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone.
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?, don't you think I would know?
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: went from everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know

(Hey)
(Ooh, ah)

I could feel it almost starts to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much, I let it go away

(Ooohh)

[Bridge:]
So cold baby (so cold), now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you'd leave me alone (yeah).
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?, don't you think I would know?

I got amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia (amnesia): everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she's a stranger
Amnesia: every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia: everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore she's a stranger that I used to know
And I don't know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
She's a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

(Hey, ooha oohaa oohaa)

Go on and, tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot, who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fuckin amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fuckin amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
I'll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn't this love insane, insane? Yeah...

// Only When I Walk Away //

[Verse 1]
You girl this little game you play
It don't stop till you go too far
So what's a man like me to say
With a bullet laying in my heart, damn, love
We go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that's the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

[Verse 2]
Now what's that, baby? What you say?
'Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til it ain't no more

Damn, love, how did the sound get so amped up?.
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit insane or insane love?
Guess that's the way that we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

You should see the look on your face
Baby when I finish what you start
But I can't hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands, love?
Laid you to rest, you said, damn love
This shit's insane, it's insane love
Ain't that the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold

Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away

Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away

She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
What am I gonna do with all this?..
Only when I walk away

(hold up, hold up)

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone and tell me, "Baby do you stay?"
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
I said, "Fuck you bitch we don't care what you say."

// Not A Bad Thing //

[Verse 1:]
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus:]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

[Chorus:]
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
[Explicit:] 'Cause you might fuck around to find your dreams come true, with me
[Clean:] 'Cause you might look around to find your dreams come true, with me
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me

[Verse 2:]
Now how about I'd be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

[Pre-Chorus:]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

[Chorus:]
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
[Explicit:] 'Cause you might fuck around to find your dreams come true, with me
[Clean:] 'Cause you might look around to find your dreams come true, with me
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

[Bridge:]
No I won't fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus:]
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
[Explicit:] 'Cause you might fuck around to find your dreams come true, with me
[Clean:] 'Cause you might look around to find your dreams come true, with me
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

// Pair Of Wings //

If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'll fly away on this pair of wings with you

If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you from the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings

We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you

And If I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you

I said if I had one wish I'd know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that will do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you

// Blindness //

Why can't I see you
Stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

I close my eyes cause you've been gone
Such a long time, I fantasize
You close so long fantasy
Began to see, it altered my mind
Am I crazy
When I open my eyes
The world was gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can't I see you
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

If I close my eyes and concentrate
You illuminate your brightest slide
And I let you go the worst mistake
It's clear as day
But I can't wrap my mind around it baby
And when I open my eyes
The world is gone, long gone, long gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold

Tell me why can't I see you
I'm stuck in black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

Tell me why can't I see you
It's like I'm stuck in black and white
And you're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

Why can't I see you
In black and white
You're in technicolor brightness
Why can't I see you
I've been struck by blindness

// Electric Lady //

[2x]
What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

[Verse 1]
Oh my, you're skipping my heart
Kiss in the dark with your lightning eyes
Said that I want you to ignite fires all night
And you got the power
You're damn right
It's life or death
Not gonna make it if you don't connect tonight right

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night,
Body moves like waves
You're reaching my heart fast
You're searching for something
That's just how electricity behaves
Now we're needing it so bad,
The other ones don't last

Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark,
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

[Hook:]
Love won't die, running low but girl your love won't die,
So what you're giving me girl
All that energy give it here
You know how it goes sometimes,
Love won't die, running low but girl,
Your love won't die,
But if you need any girl
I got energy come and get it,
Know how it goes sometimes
Sometimes I need a little(more)
Give a little, if I get a little
We could meet any place
About the middle tonight,
And you got the power,
Baby you know, if you're ever low
I will go low and bring you back into the light.

[Chorus:]
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You're reaching my heart fast
You're searching for something(yeah)
That's just how electricity behaves
And I've been needing it so bad
The other ones don't last

Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch you till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady

[2x]
What's your suggestion for tonight?
Should I turn off, or maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Maybe leave on the light?
Uh hey Electric lady.

Wait a minute I'm feeling charged
I should've known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady uh
Wait a minute until it drops,
I feel it jump, we get closer till we shock
You turn it on and I touch it till it sparks
Electric lady
