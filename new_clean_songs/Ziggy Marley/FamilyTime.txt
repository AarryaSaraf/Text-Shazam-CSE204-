Album: FamilyTime

// Family Time //

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Hi, how you doing? Hi, how you been?
It's really good to know we still got this thing
When we get together, it's so much fun
Everyone's happy, nobody's got to run

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Now the world gets busy but it's not hard to see
Family means the most to me
I'm so happy we found this time
Now we can all share what's on our minds

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Now we get together, that's how we get along
Now we get the world to sing a peace song
Everyone can see we are family
Everyone can see it's time to be free

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hi, how you doing? Hi, how you been?
It's really good to know we still got this thing
When we get together, it's so much fun
Everyone's happy, nobody's got to run

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

Lift up your hearts with a smile
Lift up your feet with a dance
Lift up your spirits with a song
It's family time, it's family time, it's family time

It's family time, it's family time, it's family time
It's family time, yeah, it's family time
Yeah, it's family time, yeah

// I Love You Too //

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

When you smile I'll smile along
When you cry my comfort comes
When you walk I'll be beside you
Holding your hands

When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away
When you tell me that you love me
This is what I'm gonna say

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

Like the fish loves the sea
Like the honey and the bee
Like a lizard loves to climb up into a tree
Like a bird love to fly way up in the sky
Like a worm loves to go way down low

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

Like the grass loves to be green
And the earth loves to be clean
Like the sun loves to shine
And the monkey loves to climb

Hey, it happens naturally
And that's the way it's got to be
And the worm still loves to go way down low

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

From the first time that I saw you
I knew that it was true
There'll be a lifelong time to spend
Around the corner around the bends

Up the hills and through the valleys
No matter how things change
This one thing will remain
I'll sing it again and again

I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
I love you

When the sun come out we play
I'll never be far away
And when you tell me that you love me
This is what I'm gonna say

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you
I love you too, I love you too

I love you too, I love you too
I tell you I love you

// Cry, Cry, Cry //

Hey... I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free

Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I'm gonna give it a fight

I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free

Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song

[Chorus]

Well now....I'm gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me

[Chorus]

Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow

[Chorus]

Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright

I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Set the children free. Set the children free
Set the children free

Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination

Set the children free
Set the children free

// Take Me To Jamaica //

Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where the reggae rhythms beat
Can't help but move my feet, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet

Where the three little birds they sing
Blue Mountains are happy again, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Feel the Caribbean breeze
Stress is calling but I can't be reached, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can meet with good people
Dance all the day, singing don't worry
One love, one heart, one aim, aim, aim

Hummingbirds humming by
(Ooh, ooh)
See the pretty yellow butterfly, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

In the night hear the crickets sing
Fireflies are jamming, so take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet, yeah

Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where the reggae rhythms beat
I can't help but move my feet, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

// Walk Tall //

Walk tall, walk tall
Even if you fall get up
Stand tall, stand tall
Even if you fall get up

Walk tall, walk tall
Even if you fall get up
Stand tall, stand tall
Even if you fall get up

Life is a lesson that we must learn
If you play with fire you might get burned
If you worry too much
You gonna get stressed
So brush off the dust
And lift up your chest

[Chorus]

Everyone creeps before they walk
Everyone cries before they talk
There comes a time you gotta be strong
So pick up your feet and sing this song

[Chorus]

Don't you worry 'bout how it looks
Not everything was written in a book
Some things you learn as you go
But here's one thing you already know

[Chorus]

Nothing is ever gonna keep me down
I jump over hurdles I'll come around
And if at first I don't succeed
I'm gonna try it again
Till I get what I need

[Chorus]

Jook it

Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Yeah

Walk tall, walk tall
Stand tall, stand tall
Walk tall, stand tall
Walk tall, stand tall

// My Helping Hands //

These are my hands, my hands are used for many things
I brush my teeth with my hands
I hug with my hands, I even paint with my hands

But what I really love to do most of all with my hands is help
I help my dad to make breakfast with my hands
I help my mom to unpack her bags when she comes
From the store, with my hands

I help to change my baby brother with my hands
I help to put away my toys with my hands
I love to do many things with my hands
But most of all I love to help with my hands, my helping hands
