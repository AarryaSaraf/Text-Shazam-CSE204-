// See Dem Fake Leaders //

See dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fires, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds and tens
If only they could lead
The world to peace and prosperity

See dem fake leaders
Now let me explain it real quick
'Cause the system full of dem tricks
And there is something you just can't miss
No matter what you think you're fighting for
To make rich those who profit from war
Look what they're doing to us people
If only they could lead
The world to love and unity

Now I have seen where we will be
And what's good for all of humanity
Not ruled by bastions of supremacy
Or ideologies of bigotry
Some people live in their bubbles
Some people live behind their walls
Some people taken for granted
Some people taken advantage of

Now we will have to lead
The world to peace and prosperity
Yeah we will have to lead
The world to love and unity

'Cause dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fires, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds and tens
Now only we can lead
The world to peace and prosperity

// The Storm Is Coming //

Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there?
The storm is coming, be ready

Brother, it's a big one
Still you just can't run
Momma can't move
So you got to stay
Rebel inna disguise
Must find a way
Harambe
A me say, harambe

Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready

Sister, it's a warning
And the eye is a-coming
Helping out your neighbour
Good God, do me a favour
Destroying all the trees
With your money disease
Causing worldwide grief
Oh, the earth need a relief

This might be if it's based on reality
You can't turn to the past, can't change your own history (cho)
The future is in my today, not my tomorrow
That's why when I grab up my pen to paper and write away the stars
You see, people can't live on promises and wishful thinking
You see, to the collective consciousness is whom I'm speaking
You see, this is a message to the world I live in
You see, you see, you see, you see

Rebel inna disguise
Oh, must find a way
Harambe
A me say Harambe

Yo, how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there (how it look out there)?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready

How it look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, get ready
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, be ready

How it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
Roll up my window (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, get ready)
Secure my door (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, are you ready?)
Suriprise in store (how it look down there?)
(The storm is coming, be ready)

// World Revolution //

Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talk 'bout, dem talkin'
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout the new generation
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution

No more killings for religions
And their political divisions
No, don't you hate me for the colour of my skin
We are bragging and boasting
We are drinking and toasting
Instead of warmongers and thieves, yeah

Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful revolution
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout a new generation
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution

Yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah (and we will stop at nothing)
My revolution, your revolution
Let's just lift these man-made borders, it causes confusion
All of the prophets already came and they laid out the blueprint
Mind elevation, there's a message in the music
From East Africa to Jamrock, we rebels with a cause
And why dem politicians always declaring war? See

When we will stop dem now
And bring that sweet change
So woman is rejoicing in the coming, of a new name
As our feet often are bound
And we have broken their chains
Our minds are free again, to roam
The open plains

Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talk 'bout, dem talkin'
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution
(We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution)
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout the new generation
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
(Word revolution...)

// Your Pain Is Mine //

Your pain is mine

When you heard, my heart cries
Oh, this emotion said it just won't lie
There's a connection, deep inside
So I let love be my guide

Your pain is mine

So

Your pain is mine
What I need to do
Your pain is mine
Who can we turn to?
Your pain is mine

When you heard, my heart cries

// Rebellion Rises //

Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises
Everywhere I go
Rebellion rises

Walks of life, let's stand together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system I protest
And we are its biggest threat
The plague of consciousness

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises

Jah call up on all people
To reject the principles of hate
And rebel against those doctrines
And the violence that they create
They say time changes everything
But we change times

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises

This is the age of awareness
Oh sooth my soul it's so restless
Turning the page to see what's next
And find us a way to pass this test
So I would a never treat you cruel
We just can't keep living by those rules
So come on people, don't be fooled

Walks of life, let's jam together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system we protest
And we are its biggest threat
The wave of consciousness

Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)

(Rebellion rises) every city (the level is rising)
(Rebellion rises) every country (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
(Rebellion rises) and it grow and it grow and it grow and it grow (the level is rising)
(Rebellion rises, the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
(Everywhere we go)
