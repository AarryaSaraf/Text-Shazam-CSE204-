// Planet B //

Open your eyes and light the fluid
Get into it, petrol siphon
Low on meals, browning fields
Bury children

Urbanization
Scarification
Population exodus
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see

Open your eyes and shoot the dingo
While this shit goes out the window
Multi-factions
Rusting tractors
Dying hero

Only way through is colonization
Acclimatization
Population exodus
Monetization
Civilization
The operation has begun
There is no Planet B

Patient seasons
Blacked out for ages
Dreaming of cake
Snowflakes blanket
Old deserts
Outskirts disperse
Earth is a blank verse
Last hearse
Dry nurse
(Oh!)

Open your eyes and see
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see

Sinners are grinners, ear to ear
Baby Jesus sheds a tear

// Mars For The Rich //

Red Mars for the rich

I'm just a poor boy
Living frugally
I see Mars on TV
I see people happy
I work fields with
Blistered fingers
I look starward
That world has no place for me

Red Mars
The czars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich

Mars for the privileged
Earth for the poor
Mars terraforming slowly
Earth has been deformed
Just forget it, ya ain't coming here
The ticket's too dear
I stare sadly into my beer
That world has no place for me

Red Mars
The czars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich
Rich

Red Mars
The czars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich
Rich

// Organ Farmer //

Make the incision
Careful precision
Blood minestrone
Decomposition
New life christen
Fatty rolls of greed

Organ farmer
Organ farmer

Delicatessen
Other profession
Growing muscle meat
Bring in the carcass
Where'd you get the body
Speak our blasphemy

Organ farmer
Organ farmer

Counterfeit hypocrite
Runs them all, runs them all
Seething ill 'cause they will
Counting coins. Counting stem cells
Wiretap turbidity
Human laboratory
Kill the squid, cut the tree
Arrogant human meat
Metal thrust, body parts pulled apart
Partly smart, partly odd, piling on
Part of me wants to breathe eternally
Part of me wants to cut out my heart

Farm colossal
Wake the fossil
In the fields of beef

// Superbug //

Superbug coming up
Feels like he'll never stop
Should'a used phages
Instead you took ages
Superbug gave a shrug
And ate all your prescription drugs
And never, ever, ever stopped
Deadly contagious
And inter-generational
Never ever, ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck

Pony up
Join the club
Shake my hand
Let's run amok

Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

Superbug coming up
H1N1 was a flop
Anti-microbial
Resistance is futile
Superbug is like a truck
Penicillin is a duck
That's sitting on the road for luck
Faceless and ageless
It's simply outrageous
Never ever, ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck

Unnecessary
Anti-Bs
Likely killed humanity

Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

// Venusian 1 //

Venusian 1

Forest desertified
Ocean wave amplify
Constant tornado sky
Black water no supply
Otherworld, surrogate
Interstellar our escape
Sulfur star liberates
Gotta beat the outbreak

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

Death admirer
Ground of fire
I heard there's a holy yellow sky
Just make sure you close your eyes
Venusian 1

Made of junk from the Earth
Human waste, how absurd
Journey is childbirth
Plant a flag, start a church
Sharp as ice in the night
Cutting space, satellite
To a sphere set alight
We escaped parasites

Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

Floating helium
Blimp of freedom
Outside air will bring you death
Just make sure you hold your breath
Venusian 1

Ve-nu-si-an 1
Ve-nu-si-an 1

I heard there's a holy yellow sky (Ve-nu-si-)
Just make sure you close eyes (an 1)
Outside air will bring your death (Ve-nu-si-)
Just make sure you hold your breath (an 1)

There is one planet V

// Perihelion //

Space is the place for the human race
Chasing the race for the new place
Days on our old place waste
Starship's team full of everybody keen
Pilot in the twilight is a deep dream
Men and machine convene

Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion

Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter she cometh to me

Solar mountain comes on the perihelion
No rerouting, only countin' till we're done
Shoutin' sins until we're in the Sun
(Peri-Perihelion)
Melting humans and everything they bring
In a blink, the sun will drink their things
Grinning sun has sinners for dinner

Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion
Peri-Perihelion

Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter she cometh to me

Peri-Perihelion (Peri-Perihelion)
Peri-Perihelion (Peri-Perihelion)
Peri-Perihelion (Peri-Perihelion)
Peri-Perihelion (Peri-Perihelion)

// Venusian 2 //

In the lap of the gods
The last one did explode
In a blaze all fiery
I sit in the cockpit
It may be a sinking ship
But fortune favours bravery

Road trip with me
Vitamin V
In focus now

Venu (Venu)
-sian two (-sian two)

Fingers getting warm
And eyes are turning gold
Evil twin is coming in
Weathering the storm
I put the birdie down
For the sin, I have a grin

Road trip with me
Vitamin V
I see the ground

// Self-Immolate //

I have gone insane oh
I lust for volcano
Be with molten lava
Give me my nirvana
I have no vertigo
I lust for tornado
Be a leaf upon air
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)

Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire
Auto-cremate
Self-immolate

Like a bird in a cage
Aerostat habitat
To motion, I am slave
Give me hell, I want that
Venusian sickness
Venusian bilious
Venusian nausea
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)

Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire

Auto-cremate (Auto-cremate)
Self-immolate (Self-immolate)

// Hell //

God it's pretty hot down here
Undersurface
Anti-Christ has tempted me
With a purpose

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Here I was thinking I'd die
I see a thousand flies and wings and tail and spines
Nausea-less, resoluteness near the entrance
Satan points me to the rats' nest

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

Fifteen infantry paratroop into the propylene new scene
Hell's where they wanna be!
Infest the rats' nest
