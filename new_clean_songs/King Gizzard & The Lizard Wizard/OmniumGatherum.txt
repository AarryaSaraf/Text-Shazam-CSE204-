// The Dripping Tap //

One more time...
Ready?
1... 2...

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
That we never hear from in these
Times of our dying needs

A familiar sound ignored
The compartmentalized thoughts
In that back corner of the drawer
That drip, drip on the floor
Don't get drowned
Hee hee hee, woo!
Heed that sound
Hee hee hee, woo!

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Suits in charge of the world and our
Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
(Woo!)

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip

Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip
Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip

Everybody's on the same orbit
When they get old and moronic
Get complacent and get bored
That drip, drip on the floor
Don't get drowned
Hee hee hee, woo!
Heed that sound
Hee hee hee, woo!

Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on, wish I learnt how to swim
Left the tap on, swamping out of the sink
Left the tap on, agua flowin' in
Left the tap on, blankets over my skin
Left the tap on

The dripping tap won't be turned off by the

Futures hanging on by a thread
With our heads in the sand
The dripping tap won't be turned off by the
Gods up above us, Big Sky Country
That we never hear from in these
Times of our dying needs

// Magenta Mountain //

Look past the dying trees, beyond waterless seas
Atop the horizon
Adjacent to the sun
I give my word that it's there - Magenta Mountain

What do you mean, you can't see it?
My life must be a dream - a living fantasy
Disappeared in hot air - Magenta Mountain

I don't believe you
Your eyes deceive you
Better check yourself in
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream
Can't you see you've gone insane?

I packed my bags and my swag for the road
Followed the bows of the ancient railroads
Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue
I'm certain it's real - Magenta Mountain

You will say I'm crazy
I will go on my way because it's what I need
I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad
Magenta Mountain
Magenta Mountain

It's you again
Yeah!
I thought I saw a statue blink and a bird with no head
Land on a golden thread
I rub my eyes
What am I saying?
There's nothing there

Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

What was confusing is now seducing
Imagination is a powerful thing
I see a flash of purple stone closing in

Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get
Don't wanna be left
Never not making it there

I am tectonic
I am megalithic
My spirit runs mauve
I am the mountain of which you dream
I see you now behind the lens looking back at me

We fell through a dream across clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through

Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain
Magenta mountain

// Kepler-22b //

Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts
Wanted to be an astronaut
So I could be alone in space
Get away
Dreamt of Kepler-22b
That's the place for me

I didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut
Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork
I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass
To refract the light from distant stars
Then I built a telescope
So big
Pointed it at Kepler-22b
That's the place for me

Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya

Can you guess the first thing I seen on Kepler-22b?
A telescope pointing back at me
On Kepler-22b
A telescope pointing back at me
On Kepler-22b
A telescope pointing back at me
On Kepler-22b
A telescope pointing back at me

Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
Good for ya
Obsession is good for ya
