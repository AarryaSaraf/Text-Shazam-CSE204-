// Millionaire //

They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, and it can't be sold
I've got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She's made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat up car, with the windows down
People look at her, then they look at me
They say that boy, he's sure living in luxury, sweet luxury

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I've got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

When her kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I've got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

// Hard Livin' //

I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't easy as it used to be

I looked a lot, but I never found
A woman that could settle me down
I was known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't easy as it used to be

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't easy as it used to be

Woo!

// Scarecrow In The Garden //

Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

Well the redhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turns to blood

I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right

// Nobody's Lonely Tonight //

Sittin' here
It's closing time
You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye

I know a way can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
Nobody's lonely tonight

What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

You'll be her
And I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight

// Tryin' To Untangle My Mind //

Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I've made a little money
I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind

Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
Let a good love spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge
And I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind

So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's looking high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind

Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I'll do what I do, til the day I die
You know heartache wrote the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind

If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's looking high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind

// A Simple Song //

Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

I finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

// Midnight Train To Memphis //

Oh!

Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Hit the floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Well now, ten for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind

Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, midnight train to Memphis

// Drunkard's Prayer //

I get drunk and talk to God
I say I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
And I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I tell him why we're through
I tell him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say, "I can't be alone"
And he'll say, "Son, you're on your own"
'Cause when I talk to God I tell him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine, all mine
I know he's a busy man, he'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God I thank him for the time

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God

// Friendship //

Say, what's wrong, my long time friend?
Something's bothering you
Tell me what the problem is
I'll see what I can do
There are times we disagree
We agree more than we don't
We won't always see eye to eye
But we will more than we won't

We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine

If you're on the street, I'll take your hand
If you're hungry, I'll give you food
If it's money you need, I got some saved
If you're sick, I'll visit you
I've been where you are right now
You saw me through it all
I'll lean on you, you can lean on me
I'm never gonna let you fall

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine

Talk to me you're pal of mine
If you feel you can't go on
Don't you sweat, it ain't over yet
This bond we share is strong
Now your welfare is my concern
You weigh less than you think
I'll carry you through the sinking sand
See if I let you sink

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
