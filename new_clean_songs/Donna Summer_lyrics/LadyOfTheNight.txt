Album: LadyOfTheNight

// Lady Of The Night //

They call her the lady of the night
She's a woman of the world
And easy-living girl with love for sale

That's what they call her the lady of the night
No one seems to know her name
And even less about the place
From where she came

Every evening when the night is close at hand
You'll find the lady on the Rue d'Avignon
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can

Don't try to change this lady of the night
She's a lot like you and me
And less than what she seems to be

(She is the lady of the night)
And easy-living girl
(she is the lady of the night)
She's a woman of the world
(she is the lady of the night)
With lots of loving for sale
(she is the lady of the night)
Lady lady of the night

Round here they call her the lady of the night
In a perfume hotel room
Shadows dance upon the wall and fade at dawn
She's no beginner this lady of the night
Never try that funny stuff
'cause lady can be tough
Be warned!

(She is the lady of the night)
She's a lot like you and me
(she is the lady of the night)
And never just what she seems
(she is the lady of the night)
No one seems to know her name
(she is the lady of the night)
Or the place from where she came

// Born To Die //

Just a baby
On a doorstep
It's how they found me
Cold and hungry
Raised on hatred
Fed by strangers
As a young girl
I often wondered

Am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

People push me
Knock me down
My foster parents
Kicked me around
They brought me up on
Loneliness
I never had me
A single friend

Am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

Must be someone
In this world
Who can save me
From myself

Or am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

Am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

// Friends //

In our childhoods days
Together we would play
People said we were inseparable

Like a brother then
My protective friend
He would always take good care of me

Friends that's what we are just
Friends no more or less oh
Here we are sharing so much fun
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

Years have come and gone
Still our friendship's strong
Now he's more than just the boy next door

I'm in love with him
Guess I've always been
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for

Friends that's all we are just
Friends so near yet so far from love
And oh the joy that he can bring
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

I'd like to tell him that I need him bad
But I'm afraid if I do I might lose
The only friend that I have

Friends that's all we are just
Friends so near yet so far from love and thus
We'll always remain friends
Friends why can't he see that I want us
To be more than just friends

// Domino //

Late last night at a fancy dress ball
I was dancing with all the queens and lords
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand
And began dancing my eyes away

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover
Domino, domino, domino

I was feeling so dizzy and lame
Was it champagne or really him to blame
Though our faces were disguised
Feelings couldn't hide
That this wasn't just some kind of game

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover
Domino, domino, domino

Domino who are you
Domino I'd like to know
Domino who's the real domino
Though we're strangers still
It's real love I feel domino

Then at midnight the bells were all rung
And he kisses me and held me in his arms
Then a crowd would ride between us
Trapped away my stranger
And I never did find him again

Domino, domino, domino
Who's this man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover
Domino, domino, domino

// The Hostage //

[Lady:] Hallo

[Kidnapper:]
Lady we've just kidnapped your husband
Have $800,000 ready by tomorrow night
And lady no police
Or you'll never see your husband alive again

[Lady:] Hallo

I remember standing there so petrified
My hand frozen to the phone
As a stranger's words that caught in my ears
And chilled me to the bone
Some dark tragedy had come right home to me
They'd kidnapped my man and his life was in their hands

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage
His life depending on their gold demands

[Lady:] Hallo

[Kidnapper:]
Lady, here's your husband through
To warn not to play any games

Husband:
Hi Honey listen I'm okay
Just make sure you do whatever they tell you
And whatever you do don't go to the police!

Well I couldn't raise that kinda money fast
So I was left no other choice
So I called the police and they came in fast
Saying "leave it up to us
Just do as they told
The ransom's in this bag
We'll watch over you
And we'll have your husband back too"

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage
His life depending on their gold demands

[Lady:] Hallo

[Kidnapper:]
Listen very carefully lady
Drive out to the abandoned shack on Highway 16
Throw the package of money out the window and keep driving
And remember lady no police!

Well my heart was heavy as I made that drive
I was sure something was wrong
I soon found the shack
I threw out the bag and I just kept driving on
Then the shots rang out and turned my car about
On the ground one lay but the other had gotten away

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage
His life depending on their gold demands

[Lady:]
Well they found my husband a few days later
Yes, the funeral's tomorrow

// Wounded //

Well there's a whole lot of hurting being going on
Well I've been wounded, wounded, wounded
This ain't no way to be carrying on
You see me wounded, wounded, wounded

I'm taken like a stone
That you've thrown in the deep blue sea
Giving me the scars that will never heal
Wounded, wounded, wounded

I remember the day when you came up to me
Almost breaking on your knees
Said you needed me more than anything else
You really took me in

But it'd make you feel good to know
I'd do anything you say
Well forget that line 'cause I ain't gonna play
Wounded, wounded, wounded

I remember the day when you came up to me
Almost breaking on your knees
Said you needed me more than anything else
You really took me in

But it'd make you feel good to know
I'd do anything you say
Well forget that line 'cause I ain't gonna play
Wounded, wounded, wounded

// Little Miss Fit //

There's a good there's a bad
Some are gay, some are sad
There's a right, there's a wrong
Those who fit don't belong

Well I'm the bad
And I've got to admit
That I'm sad
I'm a little misfit
I'm in the wrong
And that's the truth of it
I don't belong
I'm a little misfit

There's the sun there's the rain
Those in love those in pain
Some succeed while others fail
Some will ease someone tells

Well I'm in the rain
And I've got to admit
That I gonna pay
I'm a little misfit

Though I've failed
That's the truth of it
See me tell
I'm a little misfit

Life's so hard when you're far from everything
Life's so cold when you know you have no friends

Well I've lost
And I've got to admit
That I've paid the cost
I'm a little misfit

I still grow
And that's the truth of it
I'll always fall
I'm a little misfit

Well I'm bad
And I've got to admit
That I'm sad
I'm a little misfit

Well I'm bad
And that's the truth of it
That makes me sad
I'm a little misfit

Well I'm lost
And I've got to admit
That I've paid the cost
I'm a little misfit

I'm so poor

// Let's Work Together Now //

All are one

From the humble to the mighty
Those in need and those with plenty
All are one

Are only due to selfish acts of men's on greed

// Sing Along (Sad Song) //

I've an emptiness inside
That can only be describe
As a sad song
With the paint all peeling off
All the world I used to know
It's a sad song
He gave my life a meaning
When all hope inside had die
The he took the meaning back
And left me feeling oh disillusioned
He just walked out of my world
Like you'd walk out of a room
Oh you sad song

Sing along with my song
If you're lost and you're alone
Sing along if your song
Has theme of love gone wrong
Sing along and belong
Don't hold back we're growing strong
Sing along sing your song
Sing your sad your sad sad song

Ain't it strange the way life goes
First you're used and then disposed
Like a sad song
Saying love was just a word
Used to keep you hanging there
Like a sad song
You swallowed all those promises
So called upon you are
And following his footsteps
No matter just how far must follow
He just walked out of a room
Oh you sad song

Sing along with my song
If you're lost and you're alone
Sing along if your song
Has theme of love gone wrong
Sing along and belong
Don't hold back we're growing strong
Sing along sing your song
Sing your sad you sad sad song...
