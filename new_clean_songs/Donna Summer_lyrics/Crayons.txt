// Stamp Your Feet //

Put your foot down

S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground

Woah, yeah....

I've been round so many times before
Broke my back, been split open so oft
Tried to make it to the finish line
Been knocked down, get up every single time
They're up in your face, they don't think you belong
Man, you got it, you got it goin' on
What breaks the weak just makes you strong
You got game, baby bring it on, bring it on

[Chorus:]
(And) I said Stamp your feet on the ground
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound
You ain't goin'...
Stamp your feet on the ground
Make it really loud
You ain't going, you ain't goin' down
Stamp your feet on the ground
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound
You ain't goin'...
Stamp your feet on the ground
Make it really loud
You ain't goin', you ain't goin' down

Rain comes in every player's life
Gotta stay in the game, not on the sidelines
Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight
Keep your eye on the prize, don't get caught up in strife
Go, go for the shot boy, make that play just right
Braggin' about your swag won't get you through the night

[Chorus]

S-T-A-M-P You got game
S-T-A-M-P You got fame
S-T-A-M-P You got name
S-T-A-M-P Do that thang
We ain't going down, oh no!
Make me proud! Stand up and fight!

[Chorus]

Stamp your feet, stamp your feet
Stamp your feet, stamp your feet

S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down
S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down
Right till the ending, we'll make it through life
Better stamp your feet on the...
Stamp your feet on the ground

// Crayons //

Hey hey oh
Donna what's going on

1 2 3

[Chorus:]
We're like crayons melting in the sunshine
Take a big eraser and wipe out the line
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening
Say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?
We're like crayons melting in the sunshine
I'll colour your world if you colour mine
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening
Say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?

Come on over you sleepyhead
It's time to colour my dress in red
It don't matter if it's day or night
We play in colour not in black in white
Come on let's colour the world in green
Let's make a difference in the way we dream
We're going to colour a smiling face
On the people of the human race

123

I'll take a walk on the wild side
Don't be afraid you can be mine
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines
Take a walk on the wild side
Don't be afraid you could be mine
In and out of the lines, in and out, in and out of the lines

[Chorus]

(Everybody dreaming)

If we mix in some pink and blue
We get a beating at a purple hue
Mellow yellow when the day is done
Becomes the orange of the setting sun

123 come on

I'll take a walk on the wild side
Don't be afraid you can be mine
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines?
Take a walk on the wild side
Don't be afraid you could be mine
In and out of the lines, in and out , in and out of the lines

[Chorus]

Red is the colour of the blood in our veins oh
Like the rainbow we are one the same (just one yeah)
(Everybody dreaming)
Yellow is the colour of the sun we share
The green grass is everywhere
(Everybody dreaming)

[Chorus]

// The Queen Is Back //

She walks into the room
And everybody knows
It's not a day too soon
She stands and strikes her pose
Yeah whohoa

She's back
Keep on saying that you wanna see her
Look in the mirror and you wanna be her
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back, yes she's back

She's back
Keep on screaming that you want your diva
I've always told you that I'd never leave you
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back yes she's back

I'm your friend I'm your lover
I'm your sister my dear brother
I'm your dear fairy godmother
Now you know your queen is back

Call the dj call the station
Dancing all across the nation
Here for every generation
Now you know your queen is back

So many years ago on the radio
She crept into your soul
And loved to love you oh oh

She's back
Keep on saying that you wanna see her
Look in the mirror and you wanna be her
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back yes she's back

She's back
Keep on screaming that you want your diva
I've always told you that I'd never leave you
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back, yes she's back

I'm your friend I'm your lover
I'm your sister my dear brother
I'm your dear fairy godmother
Now you know your queen is back

Call the dj call the station
Dancing all across the nation
Here for every generation
Now you know your queen is back
The queen is back

Keep on saying that you want me when you're all alone
Keep on saying that I make you feel like you belong
Keep on saying that you want your diva one on one
Keep on saying baby baby baby here I come

// Fame (The Game) //

You're fabulous
Fantastic
Now we have all the right property

[Chorus:]
Fame makes a fool out of anyone
Fame takes you back to the golden childhood
Fame makes you think that you're having fun
Fame the game

Turn your mobile on
Get off into the limousine
To the early morning show
Everyday routine
Make up fake up get a manicure
Five minute autographs, grab a picture, yes or no
All the same answers to the same questions
Create a scandal with your reaction
What's that you say
Take it or leave it
Paparazzi wanna see you bleeding

[Chorus]

Late suit days, hair extensions
Botox faux false interventions
Nude job, boob job, all nouveau
It ain't what, but who you know
Uncalled perjury, cosmetic surgery
Dirty secrets frame your glory
It'll get the cover story

[Chorus]

Everybody wanna be a star
It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere en entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for

Since I was a child of three
I'd watch old movies on the silver screen
Kate Bette and Marilyn were the reigning queens
(do you wanna be a star?)
I know if I can make it out
Out of this sleepy town then I could go real far
I could I'd really work so hard
And I could do it and do it and do it 'til I become a star

[Chorus]

Miami, London, Paris in a week
Lying in private, catching up sleep
Celebrity parties, politic profits
Rock'n' roll bullyboys walk the red carpet
Getting in VIP through the velvet rope
Shake hands, photograph and you gotta go
Little black book pools with the CEO
Smile and tell'em what they wanna know
And tell'em what they wanna know

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for

[Chorus]

Everybody wanna be a star
It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere an entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah

You're fabulous! Fantastic!

// Sand On My Feet //

Wakin' up this morning
Saw the sun come through my blinds
And I looked up on the porch
And found an owl shrieking by
But never could I have imagined
Such a place like this
And you're lyin' next to me
I wanna wake you with a kiss

And all the crazy things about you
That I so adore
Are the little things that keep me
Coming back for more

[Chorus:]
And it feels like love, and it feels so good
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)
All that I need, baby it's true
The sand on my feet and you

I will go wherever you go
Take me where you lead?
Lead me where you want
My heart doesn't know?
Anything but what you say
You're the one for me
You make me feel complete

I can silent read your whisper
And my lips still feel your touch
And I'm oh so glad to be here
Oh so glad to be here

[Chorus]

But you and I have walked the oceans
Miles along the shore
And a thousand seagulls called on me
So we came right back for more
And I love to feel the water
It makes me feel so free
Underneath the purple sky
Every time you look at me

I reach up to forever
With the promises you keep
They fill me with such happiness
It makes my heart believe

[Chorus]

How many lovers
Have walked along the shore before
Before you and I
How many said goodbye

// Drivin' Down Brazil //

Tudo bem Tudo bem Tudo bom bom
Heat grows in his mind, hits the steering wheel to tryin' tune the radio out loud
He heard Jobim say, and his heart began to sway
He didn't think of anything but his baby
He was drivin' keep on drivin' he kept drivin' down brazil
He feels batucada he dances the samba
If only in his head

[Chorus:]
He was drivin' down brazil
All pimped up and dressed to kill
A thousand single dollar bills
In his low ride Bonneville
He was drivin' down brazil
He was drivin' down brazil
And he gave the girls a thrill
In his low ride bonneville
He's the king king of the hill
He was drivin down brazil

Shhh shut up and get your baby
Please comma comma get your baby
Please comma comma get your baby, shes waiting
He cruised up to the light, she jumps in by his side
They kiss and wave goodbye oh
They had so much to say, but the groove began to play
He couldn't think of anything but his baby
He was drivin' keep on drivin' he kept drivin' down brazil
He dreams of Amanda while he sips guarana, in his mind she's dressed in red
If anything

[Chorus]

Comma comma comma get your baby [6x]
Tudo bem Tudo bem Tudo bom bom [6x]

He feels batucada he dances the samba
If only in his head
Makes me crazy

[Chorus]

Just have to comma get your baby
Just have to comma get your baby
Just have to comma get your baby
She's waiting

// I'm A Fire //

I am a fire
Can't you feel the heat?
I am a furnace
Come burn in me
You are, you are, you are
The thing that makes me hotter
I need, I need your love
To make me warmer
I'm burning
I'm burning

Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like a torch becomes you guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the star bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

I am a fire
Can you feel the heat?
I am desire
Come feel the beat
You are, you are, you are
The thing that makes me hotter
I need, I need your love
It makes me warmer
I'm burning
I'm burning

Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like a torch becomes your guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the stars bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

You gave me everything I am
Came into my heart and tore it around
How could I know
You'd be the one
Honestly I am so taken

Believe in me and I in you
You're like water on my chocolate
You're like...
Can you feel it?
Do I need to say it?
Can't you just feel it?

Take your time
Let me feel it
Oooo babe oooo baby
Come on now

[Scat]

Que sera
Esta vida
Oh yo te quiero, yo te quiero, yo te quiero
Esta manana

[Scat]

Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like the torch becomes your guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the star bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

I'm burning and I need you
I'm burning and I need you
I'm burning and I need you

// Slide Over Backwards //

Oh Lord

Ride over backwards
Ride over backwards
Ride over backwards
Ride over backwards

I was just a little girl
A-making my own way
16 years or more I had
Nothing left to say

I raised myself up almost
Lived on po'boys too
New Orleans ain't a place to live
If you never been to school

And I said
Ride over backwards
Slide over backwards
Ride over backwards
Let me ride

People gotta tell you
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
Ride over backwards
Let me ride

Daddy was a working man
He worked since he was 5
He dropped his wings on my train one day
And never learned to fly

I wonder what it takes to be
Someone who knows why
The earth ain't round
Unless you can
Teach yourself to fly

And I said
Ride over backwards
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
Let me ride

People gotta tell you
Slide over backwards
Slide over backwards
(sometimes you gotta be free)
Slide over backwards
Let me ride

Some days in a lifetime you gotta be strong
Some days in lifetime you gotta be brave
Dig on your knees sometimes
Sometimes you even gotta pray

Lord what it is what it is

Sometimes I feel like I'm going down, going down
Going down for the very last time
Oh don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Sometimes I feel like going down

Deep in my heart I pray
Ride over backwards...

// Science Of Love //

Chemistry look what you've done to me
Chemistry brought me near gravity
Chemistry look what you've done to me

You've called me up
My heart is pounding
Can't bear to breath
I've Just got over you

What do you want
You like a broken record
Spinnin' in my head
Why can't you let me be?

I don't understand
What it is about you
The more you reject me
The more I want from you

You're always on my mind
Always have been, always will be
I think about you all the time
I don't want to, you're a habit

And I'm running and running and
Running and running away from you
Every time when you call,
I come undone can't escape from you

Is it the science of Love?
Is it the science of Love?
It's the science of Love
It's the science of Love

I'm thinking to fight it
To get away from you
Something always pulled me
Right back to you

I don't understand
What it is about you
The more you reject me
The more I want from you

You're always on my mind
Always have been, always will be
I think about you all the time
I don't want to, you're a habit

And I'm running and running
And running and running away from you
Every time when you call,
I come undone can't escape from you

Is it the science of Love?
Is it the science of Love?
I wanna be with you but I'm so afraid
My heart's not ready cause I'm still in pain
I'm feeling my love is out of control
I wanna give up but I can't let go

You're always on my mind
Always have been, always will be
I think about you all the time
I don't want to, you're a habit

And I'm running and running and running and running away from you
Every time when you call, I come undone can't escape from you
Is it the science of Love?
Is it the science of Love?
It's the science of Love
It's the science of Love
Love is Science....

// Be Myself Again //

Let me introduce myself
I'm a woman that you've never seen
You might know me from somewhere else
As someone that I've never been

I gave everything to play the game
My soul fell apart at the seems
I fell down like a house of cards
When somebody pulled the Queen

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again

You must believe me when I say
Don't live someone else's desire
Turn it around like a photograph
The writing's been there all the time

Now you can have all these hopes and dreams
The ones I can't use anymore
I don't know what it is you lost
But I hope you got what you came for

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again

Sometimes I wanna leave right now
Sometimes I wanna cry out loud
I wanna let it all hang out
But I don't wanna let you down

Sometimes I wanna just lay here
Sometimes I wanna disappear
I wanna show you all my fear
But I don't wanna let you down

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again
To be myself again...

// Bring Down The Reign //

Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light

Tears were holding water
Crying for us all
Every son and every daughter
Rise up before we fall

Darfur, Darfur
The grace of God be with you
Waiting for arms of mercy
To surround us all

Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light
Open the doors heaven

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Let me feel the wind again

One voice is like a choir
Singing sacred words
Break through all our resistance
Till it bends the Universe

Darfur, Darfur
The grace of God be with you
Waiting for arms of mercy
To surround us all

Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light
Open the doors heaven

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Let me feel the wind again,
Oh let me feel the wind again...

To the broken heart
Of a wounded child
Covered with scars
Crying out loud

What will it take
To open your heart
Before his last breath
Before he departs

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
I said
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Everybody [5x]

// It's Only Love //

It's only Love
It's only Love
It's only Love
That makes me whole

Take me on a journey
To the bottom of your soul
Take me on a journey
While we're on the dance floor

I don't mind
You see I don't care
You've got a thousand chances
While we're out of here

Take me to the land
Of millions dances
Come on and
Let me Love me, Love me

Come on and
Love me, Love me, Love me
Come on and
Let me Love me, Love me

Move, move, move, move
Till you can't see
Close you eyes
Till you're swept up in the mystery
I don't need nothing but you and music
Take me, take me, take me

It's only Love [repeat 6x]

Come on and let me Love
Me, Love me
Come on and Love me, Love me, Love me
Come on and let me Love me, Love me
Come on and let me love me, love me
[Repeat 3x]

Take me down to land of the thousand dances
Take me down to the land of the thousand dreams
Take me down to the land of the thousand dances
Make me, make me dream.

Let me be me
Let me be free
Let me be free
Let me be me

You're Loving, Loving me now [2x]

[repeat 5x]

Dancin' and Dancin'
Dancin' and Dancin' all night long
Dancin' and Dancin'
It's only Love that makes me whole
