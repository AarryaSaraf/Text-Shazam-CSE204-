// Supernatural Love //

We were strangers
Who one were lovers
We've been everlasting friends

I was shattered
When you walked out, boy
I was walking off the edge

Friends, said I looked so down-hearted
When you left
Now my broken heart is stable
I'm starting to mend
Got you back and I'm living again

Oh, this must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love

Life was only tear drops falling down
From my eyes
Now my broken heart is stable
Oh, I'm coming alive
I can't fight what I'm feeling inside

This must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love
That gets me so excited
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes us true survivors
A supernatural love

Friends, said I looked so down-hearted
When, when you left
Now my broken heart is stable
I'm starting to mend
Got you back and I'm living again

Oh, this must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love
That gets me so excited
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes us true survivors
A supernatural love

// It's Not The Way //

We used to south of paradise
That was ok until you put your heart on ice
Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye
Hide away and left me lonely
When I asked you why
You wouldn't be precise
Now it's my turn, start taking my advice

It's not the way that you love me
It's not the way that you care

Running down long back alleys
Pouting like a spoiled child
You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild
Your heart is like an elevator
You tell me that's just human nature
I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you

It's not the way that you love me
It's not the way that you care

Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way

Your love is like a nasty habit
I finally got control but I just can't take it
I tried to be cool but I just can't make it
Your heart is like an elevator
You tell me that it's just human nature
I've done all I can, but just can't change you

Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way

Love is tough, love is tender
Love will make your heart surrender
Love is sweet, love is kind
Love will always blow your mind

It's not the way that you love me
It's not the way that you care

Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say
Oh no, it's not the way
Oh no, it's not the way
Listen mister to what I say...

// There Goes My Baby //

All alone I sit
Looking out of the window
And the rain just keeps coming on down

Well, I cry to myself
So many things that I have done wrong
Now I'm watching you
Walk out

There goes my baby
Moving on down the line
Wonder where
Wonder where
Wonder where he is bound

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

What can I do
Said I'll sing this sad, sad song

Oh yeah, I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Where is he going?
How is he?
What is he going through
Where is he going?
And what on earth could he be going through

Oh, there goes my baby
Moving on down the line
Wonder where
Wonder where
Wonder where he is bound

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Where is he going?
How is he?
What is he going through
Where is he going?
And what on earth could he be going through

Oh, there goes my baby
Moving on down the line, oh yeah baby
Come on come

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Sing this song forever
Till we're back together
Oh, oh, oh

// Suzanna //

Suzanna, you better watch your mouth
Suzanna, bad things are coming out
Somebody's watching from on high
Distant love is hard to find

Always looking for the right direction, oh yeah
Move in and out without detection, yeah
How many times have others gone and spoke their mind
Out of line, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice

Suzanna, Suzanna

Suzanna, what's that look on your face
Suzanna, girl you look out of place
Somebody's watching from behind
Don't tell them anything you find

Wanna live your life without correction, yeah
Move in and out looking for perfection, oh yeah
How many times you've gone and spoken out your mind
Out of line, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice

Suzanna, Suzanna

How many times you've been caught talking your jive
How many times lives you've gone and ruined it's a crime, oh yeah
It's a crime, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice

Somebody's watching from behind
Just be aware of what you find

Suzanna
Suzanna, what's that look on your face
Suzanna, girl you look out of place
Suzanna, what's that look on your face
Suzanna, girl you look out of place

// Cats Without Claws //

It's a windy night
Of first and main
Of any city
Of a hundred names
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low
And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow
And the cats are out, gonna harmonize
They're headed for Cool Street on the main line
And here comes that Joe Serpentine
The life of a cat can leave you far behind

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

It's hard to be yourself
When everyone else is around
There's always someone out there
Trying to pull you down
You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon
You bet your life and you sell your soul
Give it all up for beggar's gold
And the hidden city has its own laws
Produces a species cats without claws

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

Oh, here they come again
Singing songs in a melody
Do, do, do, do, do

Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life
And the streets are full of pain
Specially when it's calling out your name
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice
The things the world has to offer nice
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind

Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, oh, oh, oh

// Oh Billy Please //

You said you loved me
Then why won't you let me
Be who I am all of the time

Said you wouldn't hurt me
Then why would you leave me
And take my peace of mind
Ah, ah

Oh, Billy please take my call
Ah, ah
Billy I've tried most of all
Ah, ah

We've got to stop having
This misunderstanding
There'll never be another guy

I'm sending this letter
Hope you're feeling better
Can't stop this raining from my eyes
Ah, ah,

Oh, Billy please take my call
Ah, ah,
Billy I've tried most of all
Ah, ah

Don't be a fool for some lies
Ah, ah,
Billy I've tried over time
Ah, ah,

If you love me
If you love me

Some people say I'm a fool for loving you
There's no perfect guarantee
And I know you will agree

Oh, Billy please take my call
Ah, ah
Billy I've tried most of all
Ah, ah

Oh, Billy please take my call
Ah, ah
Billy I've tried most of all
Ah, ah

Don't be a fool for some lies
Ah, ah
'cause Billy I've tried more than twice
Ah, ah
Hey, hey, ah, ah

// Eyes //

Right outside the window
Something's happening
A man he stares into a TV screen
From the next apartment we hear music
Bleeding through the scene

TV pand the bedroom, woman's sleeping
Hand are sprawled out loosely across the bed
She must be pretty rich
'cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck

And there's always someone watching eyes
TV's on and someone watching eyes

Silent sunbeams falling across the window
Suddenly she awake with surprise
Day and night they always go so quickly
In TV time

Her husband rushes in and in the meantime
She just slightly smiles and turns her head
He just whispers something to her softly
God knows what he said

And there's always someone watching eyes
TV's on and someone watching eyes

You know it wasn't very long
Before the two of they were kissing
She was his wife, he was her man
But they knew what they were missing

And there's always someone watching eyes
TV's on and someone's watching eyes
In the kitchen someone's watching eyes
And the maid and butler's watching eyes

TV's on somebody's watching
TV's on somebody's watching

And there's always someone watching eyes
TV's on and someone's watching eyes

They're getting in through your eyes
Don't let them poison your mind

// Maybe It's Over //

You were the first
And you taught me how to love
And you'll always stay close to my heart
But it would not be fair it I wouldn't tell you now

That it's over, baby it's over

You took this lonely child
And you taught it how to feel
You took the rain clouds from my eyes
You made fantasy seem real
Still it hurts me so inside
But I can't change and I can't hide

That it's over, maybe it's over

Oh now, I know you're not the one
It's me
I've changed inside
I feel a need to be free
It's over
Maybe baby it's over

I was a lonely girl
Just calling out for him
You taught me how to live
You taught me how to love myself
Still it hurts me so inside
But I can't change and I can't hide

That's it's over, baby it's over

Oh, now I know you're not the one
It's me
I've changed, changed inside
I feel a need to be free

It's over
Maybe baby it's over
It's over
Please don't hate me
But it's over

Don't you know that I love you
Don't you know that I care
Don't you know that I love you
But I can't always be there
It ain't you
No, it's me
Gonna fly like a bird
Fly like a bird
Yeah, I must be free

// I'm Free //

I was stranded in the dark
Trying to find an open door
So alone

Chains were wrapped around my heart
Didn't know what love was for
No more
Heard these voices in my head
Telling me you'll never escape
No you can't get away

When the spirit in me said
Your love could show me the way
My whole life changed on that day

Now I'm walking in the light
All aglow
All I see is sunshine in my eyes
Skies of blue, it's true

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I'm free

I was frightened in the cold
Desperate when you found me in time
You saved me from the world

Got my life back in control
Chased away the madness in my mind
You saved me right in time

Now my future's looking up
Skies of blue, all because of you
Got the sunshine in my life
All aglow, baby, don't you know

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I'm free

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

// Forgive Me //

Every day I give you a reason to cry
'cause I see the hurt in your eyes
But stronger yet
I see the love that shines
Help me learn to take on the nature of you
And love more than I accuse
And pardon others like you taught me to

Something happens inside my heart
Lord when I obey
Something happens inside my heart
Every time I pray

Forgive me
As I learned how to forgive
And reach out through the pain
And touch with hands of grace
Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
And reach out through my own pain
And touch with hands of grace

As you prayed for those who crucified you
"forgive they don't know what they do"
Compassion reached out to a world confused
Help me learn to bless those who persecute me
And pray for my enemies
And show them mercy like you've shown to me

'Cause something happens inside my heart
Lord when I obey
Something happens inside my heart
Every time I pray

Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
The ones that broke my heart
The way I've broken yours
Forgive me
As I learn how to forgive
And reach out through my own pain
And touch with hands of grace

Forgive me
