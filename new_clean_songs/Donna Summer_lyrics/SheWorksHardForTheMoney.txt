// She Works Hard For The Money //

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

I met her there in the corner stand
And wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
9 am on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
She's waiting for her clientele

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Already knows, she's seen her bad times
Already knows, these are the good times
She'll never sell out, she never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works haaaaard

[Instrumental Interlude]

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Alright...

// Stop, Look And Listen //

I was walking down the street
Just the other day
I caught a glimpse
Of life vivid reality
I saw a man on the street
Had no clothes or shoes
These are signs of the times
That's what they say

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

The prophets of the times
Are written on street car walls
Can't you see them crying
Can't you hear them call

Mother mother children still
Got to grow
Father father where do we go

Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Space age assures us life will
Go on
And everybody trying to believe
Forget the future
Think about right now

Somehow seem to be growing
Theme
Prophets of the times
Are written on street car walls
Can't you see them crying
Can't you hear them calling
Mother mother children still have
To grow
Father father where do we go

Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Space age assures us life will
Go on
Everybody trying to believe
Forget the future
Think about right now

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Forget the future
Think about right now

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

Everybody better
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
Stop look and listen
To your heart

// He's A Rebel //

He's a rebel and you may not like his
Looks or his style
Be he's faster than light and he
Can walk a miracle mile
He'll point you out and he'll pull you in
I guarantee he'll be your best friend

He's a rebel and he's gonna be good
Anyhow
And the boys in the group they just
Want to drag him way down
He's so straight ahead, he'll blow
Your mind
He can be strong and yet so kind

What you see is what you get
And what you get you won't regret
'cause he's on the line
What you want is what he's got and
What he's got, he's got a lot
'cause it's allright
It's allright

Ooh he's a rebel, written up in the
Lambs book of life
And there'll be no escape because
The stage has been set for a while
If he comes your way, he'll make you
Surrender
His story's clear and his voice
So tender

What you see is what you get
And what you get you won't regret
'cause he's on the line
What you want is what he's got and
What he's got, he's got a lot
'cause it's allright
It's allright

If he comes your  way he'll make you
Surrender
His words are clear and his
Love's forever

He's a rebel and he doesn't conform
That's for sure
Society rules and it's fallin' right
Down to the core
He'll love you like you've never been
Loved before
He always leaves you wanting
Him more

He's a rebel
See that rebel
Yeah, that's a rebel
That's a rebel
He's a rebel
See that rebel
There's the rebel
There's the rebel

// Woman //

Girlfriend can we talk
Well I have something to say
Girl when you're dealing with
Your man
There just ain't no easy way, no
Easy way

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should
God he made the woman
God he made the man
Knew just what he wanted in his
Master plan
Want your man to love you with all
His heart and soul
Let him be who he is
Let him take control

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
Let him know it
Let your life begin to show some

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

Want him to be faithful
Love and understand
Want him to be kind
Be your lovin' man

Forget about the hard times
Think about the good
That's when he will treat you just
The way he should

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
Let him know it
Let your life begin to show some

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
You're a woman
You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
You're a woman

Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman

// Unconditional Love //

What a man
You know it's a bright and shiny day
I want to say something to you
I love you just like Ja do

We know a place
Where Ja's people can run free
A new kind of love
And we call it agape

Don't take too long to find
True love transcends all time
That non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Don't try to change or tear your
Brother down
Let him make his mistakes
And he will come around
Hasten just to pray and Ja's true
Word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Hasten just pray and Ja's true
Word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return
Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn
Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn
Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

// Love Has A Mind Of Its Own //

Think about me and you
Think of all the changes we've
Been through
The laughter an the tears, the
Years together
Little did we both know
When we fell we gave up all control
Though times get hard
We're strong enough to carry on

'Cause
Love has a mind of its own
It moves in its own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of its own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart, you're my home

(I) stayed awake last night
Told myself that this time we were
Through
That passion wasn't pair, my heart
Had changed
But then in the morning light
The feeling cut me like a knife
And then I knew
I couldn't walk away from you

'Cause
Love has a mind of its own
It moves in its own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of its own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart, you're my home

We can drive ourselves so far apart
The world gets in between
Before you know, the distance grows
Till never we lose sight of the dream
But the wonder of it all
Is how love will survive
It never fails to keep us going
It never fails to keep us alive

'Cause
Love has a mind of its own
It moves in its own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of its own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart, you're my home
Love has a mind of its own
It moves in its own circles
And it roams where it will roam
Love has a mind of its own
It holds our lives together
You're my heart, you're my home

// Tokyo //

Met this stranger there, so I was
Feeling somewhat scared
When I vacationed in a land that I
Didn't know that well
But all the ladies there were nice
The gentlemen politely out of line
I kept on thinking how I'd like
To spend some time
I couldn't make up my mind, still
Waitin' for the right sign
I was down in Tokyo
Livin' in hotel Imperial

Met this man, he was something
Very strange
Said he was a spy from somewhere
Else way far away
He told me things about myself that
I could tell nobody else
Passed this message on to me, said
Spirits move in secrecy
I could almost read the man's mind
Waitin' for the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo

He passed this message on to me
Said spirits move in secrecy
A double agent amnesty
An Ian Fleming mystery

I, I know I read the man's mind
I know I got the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo

// I Do Believe (I Fell In Love) //

You and me we're together, loving
Eyes can always stray
Loving hearts will always find
The way
Don't pass through my life like a
Season
Don't hurry by like a highway sign
Hear with your heart while I tell you
What's on my mind

Do believe I fell in love
Do believe I fell in love
Ooh yeah

If I make mistakes please forgive me
Oh Charlie B don't you run away
Forget your pride I'll tell you that
I'm going to stay
'cause love knows no pain, knows
No worry
Love is the same for all times
Hear with your heart while I tell you
What's on my mind

Do believe I fell in love
Do believe I fell in love
Ooh yeah

Ooh let me love you
Ooh let me kiss you
Baby I'm fallin', your love is a callin'
The night is wasting away
It used to be you, and I knew at
The dawning
Our love would last more than a day
And every single little word is true
I still love you

Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love

I'm going to love you like nobody's
Loved you
Come rain or shine
I'm going to need you like nobody's
Needed you before

Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
Do believe it
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
