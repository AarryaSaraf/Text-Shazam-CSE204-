Album: Furniture

// Furniture //

This is a song with no words.

But no one can hear the missing.

They just look at my mouth

And look at my mouth

And say hey man, I know where you're coming from.

Furniture has no say in life,

It was made to be used by people.

How many times have you felt like a bookcase

Sitting in living room gathering dust

Full of thought already written?

This is a song with no words.

But no one can hear the missing.

You can see my mouth and see that it's moving

I think you already know where I'm coming from

Right here.

// Hello Morning //

Hello morning and the morning sun

Lights up the damage that the damage's done

Send a message you can understand

We're time capsules in a garbage can

Shelved with things we used to use

A box of candles with the wicks removed

A battery chambered with corrosive rust

A sealtest box with its top ripped off

You made your bed but now lie in it

Hello evening from the waning world

Where things still breathe and colors turn

But the tracks of what you used to know

They're no longer running under you

A well made bed

Now lie in it.
