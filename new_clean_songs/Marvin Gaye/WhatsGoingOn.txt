Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today - yeah

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, oh (Oh)

Picket lines (Sister) and picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister) with brutality (Sister)

Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on - uh
Right on baby
Right on baby

// What's Happening Brother //

Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read

Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than, it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?

Are they still getting down
Where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant
Do you think, they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me, what's out and I want to know what's in

What's the deal man
What's happening? Tell me brother
What's happening brother?
Ah, what's happening brother?
What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, whoo, what's happening brother?

What's been shaking up and down the line?
I want to know because, I'm slightly behind the times

// Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky) //

Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh and, I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me

Flying high in a friendly sky
Flying high in a friendly sky

// Save The Children //

I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares, to save a world in despair?
Who really cares?
There'll come a time (There'll come a time)
When the world won't be singing (When the world won't be singing)
Flowers won't grow (flowers won't grow, no)
Bells won't be ringing (the bells won't be ringing)
Who really cares? (Who really cares?)
Who's willing to try? (Who is willing to try?)
To save the world, (to save the world)
That's destined to die (that is destined to die)
When I look at the world (when I look at the world)
It fills me with sorrow (it fills me with sorrow)
Little children today (children today)
Are really going to suffer tomorrow (really suffer tomorrow)
(Oh!) What a shame (what a shame)
Such a bad way to live (such a bad way to live)
Oh, who is to blame? (Who is to blame?)
We can't stop living, (when we can't stop living)
Live, (Live)
(Live for life) Live for life
(But let live everybody)
Live life for the children (live life for...the children. Oh, for the Children)
You see, let's...let's save the children
Let's...let's save all the children, (Save the babies, save the babies!)
(And if you want to love, you got to...save the babies)
(Oh you've got the feeling, you've got the feeling)
(You will save the babies, all of the Children)

But who really cares?
Who's willing to try?
To save our world
To save our sweet world
To save a world
That is destined...to die
Oh, la la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody

// God Is Love //

Don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He made this world for us to live in (He made this world)
And gave us everything (Lord gave us everything)
And all he asks of us (Peace!) is we give each other love, oh yeah

Don't go and talk about my father
Because God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it (Just loves us, oh yeah)
And He'll forgive all our sins, (He'll forgive our sins) forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, oh yeah, is we give each other love, oh yeah

Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, love your brother

Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
And when we call on Him for mercy, mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know

// Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology) //

Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

// Right On //

Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other

I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes

Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air

For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on

Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on

For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else

Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love

Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby

// Wholy Holy //

Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling

Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another
Wholy holy
We should believe in one another
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in, in it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah

Wholy
Oh Lord, we can conquer hate forever, we need him
Wholy
We can rock the world's foundation
Everybody together, together and holy
Will holler love, love, love across the nation

Oh, oh
Wholy holy
All together and holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh, oh, ooo

// Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) //

Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-not's
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it

Oh, make you want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no

Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes

Make me want to holler
And throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me want to holler
And throw up both my hands

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply because we wear our hair long

// Sad Tomorrows //

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it
In the morning I'll be alright, my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble, baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it
I know I'm hooked, my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men

Ahh yeah - (I did the best I could)
Ahh yeah - (Nobody understood)
Nobody, nobody - (I did the best I could)
Goodnight, darling - (Nobody understood)
Take me away, take me away tonight - (I did the best I could)
I'm so... - (Nobody understood)
Nobody - (I did the best I could)
