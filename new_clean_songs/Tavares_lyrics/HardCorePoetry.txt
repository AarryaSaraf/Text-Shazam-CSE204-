// She's Gone //

Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, woo, what will be

She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I'd
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

Get up in the morning look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken her dirty toll on me

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
Pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was to me

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong
I'm talkin' to myself

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

// My Ship //

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow
No

Well I got myself a steady job
And I've earned everybody's respect
Moving up higher up
There's a beauty that I got to protect

I've been saving every penny I can (that I can)
And I'm working a promise [?] (yes I am)
But I won't be complete
Til I'm reaching for a feminine hand
I keep on trying to tell you girl

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

I got everything I need but you
What's a man in my position to do?
Got a hold that was built
And designed for occupation for two
Brand new

I can listen to my CD you know
I can drive my car where I want to go
A material thing can be bought if you got money to blow
But money won't be devotion

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

Getting much closer to
The man I want to be (can't you see I'm changing)
But all this money see
Is only making me sad and lonely (so sad, so sad and lonely)

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow
No

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

// Too Late //

Too late
Am I too late
Too late
Am I too late

Pain is my best friend
Making me think of you again
Waking me up and saying
"Fool, you've been careless and blind, unkind"

Tears I made you shed (look who's crying)
Me, I made this bad (no denying)
I'm the man whose jones
Can't be brought into line

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor (too late)
No, no, no, no

Eyes that could not see (what you needed)
Arms that could not be (what you wanted)
Lips that would not say
What you waited to hear, my dear

I'm the one to blame (I admit it)
That and I'm so ashamed (that I did it)
Girl, I'm coming home
It's you I wanna be near (hey, hey, hey)

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor

Too late
Am I too late
Too late
Am I too late

Too late, ooh-ooh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, ooh-ooh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, ooh-ooh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, ooh-ooh-hoo, woo-hoo

(Too late) Can I get in the door
(Too late) Wanna love you some more
(Too late) Can't you see that I'm free
(Too late) Girl, it's love that I need

Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me it isn't too late

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor
Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me, yeah

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor
Girl, I was wrong, this is where I belong

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late

// Remember What I Told You To Forget //

Hello Baby
I betcha never thought I would call
Well my heart just went in with this dime
And I only get three minutes time
Hear me out now
I wanna to make it as clear as I can
There's so much that I want to explain
And the final decision remains
In you hands

Please remember what I told you to forget
There's a man on the phone
And he wants to come home
To the woman he loves all alone

Baby remember what I told you to forget
No I won't waste anytime when I hang up the line
I'll be back in your arms
Where I know I belong

One more minute
Let me pour my heart out to you
'Cause I've kept it all locked up inside
You just can't tell your own foolish pride what to do

So remember what I told you to forget
No I wouldn't waste anytime when I hang up the line
I'll be back in your arms
Where I know I belong

If it isn't already too late
Let me give you a reason to wait
For the life that I'm begging to live
Will depend on the answer you give

Please remember what I told you to forget
There's a man on the phone
And he wants to come home
To the woman he loves all alone

Baby remember what I told you to forget
No I won't waste anytime when I hang up the phone
I'll be back in your arms
I'll be back in your ar

// Hard Core Poetry //

It depends on who is looking at the tenement walls
Whether he's coming home or passing through
You can walk the streets and find so much to criticize
But that would be the easy thing to do

'Cause there's beauty in the concrete
If you see it with your heart
The sidewalks only hurt you
If you hate them from the start

This is a song not necessarily sweet
I'll pass it on to folks that I never will meet
And if my words don't make history
Just call it hardcore poetry

You can blame the world if troubles come and knock at your door
Let your weakness cut you down to size
If you find some fault with everything surrounding you
Maybe it's your narrow-minded eyes

'Cause there's music in the city
If your ear is to the ground
Only nonbelievers
Never hear a single sound

This is a song not necessarily sweet
I'll pass it on to folks that I never will meet
And if my words don't make history
Just call it hardcore poetry

This is a song not necessarily sweet
I'll pass it on to folks that I never will meet
If my words don't make history
Just call it hardcore poetry
