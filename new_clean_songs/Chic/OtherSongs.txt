// I'll Be There //

Into the Disco Scene ha

I'll be there
I'll be there

Life began for me
When a single DJ dropped the needle on my vinyl
(Everybody Dance)
I look out to see
People on the dancefloor, living proof of our revival

Every night was a blast
We were flying fast, flying free, we were driven
No I don't (want to live in the past
But it is a nice place to visit)
And if you come along
I'll be there

If you come along
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
If you come along

Equal days and nights
All around the world
There was an explosion (the clock keeps turning)
I was more alive (it's getting late)
Cause we worship music and it symbolised emotion

Smash after smash after smash
I appreciate all the gifts I was given
Now I dont want to live in the past
But its a nice place to visit
So if you come along
I'll be there

If you come along
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
If you come along

I'll be there
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there

If you come along
I'll be there
And if you come along
I'll be there
No place like home
I'll be there
So if you come along
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there

Lets get through it, we almost did it

// Soup For One //

Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else

Why must I be so depress
I feel I'm not like the rest
'Cause I want love to be right
Stay with your darlin' all night

Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else

Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home

You have that look in your eye
Just wanted you to be mine girl
To bath you in the moonlight
And love you with all my might

Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else

Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
