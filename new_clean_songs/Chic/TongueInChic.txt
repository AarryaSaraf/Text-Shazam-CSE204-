// I Feel Your Love Comin' On //

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I'm exposed to your love
And I feel so susceptible
My resistance is low
'Cause you're oh so incredible

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

When you do your dance
The magic intensifies
I'm like putty in your hands
When you take me so deep inside

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on [repeat]

I'm exposed to your love
And I feel so susceptible
My resistance is low
'Cause you're oh so incredible

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

// When You Love Someone //

When you want someone
You're like a child at play
And when you need someone
It's such a lonely game
But when you love someone
The sun shines just for you
When you love someone
Your heart it lights up too

When you want someone
It's neither here nor there
And when you need someone
The pain's too much to bear
But when you love someone
It's like Shangri-La around you
When you love someone
There's the beauty that surrounds you

When you want someone
You look and think how nice
And when you need someone
You feel like you're gonna die
But you can be so happy

When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
Thank God I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
Thank God I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine for me so very bright

When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
I love someone...

// Hey Fool //

If you ever need the lovin'
And another dream is comin'
If you ever need the lovin'
I'll be with you on the money

If you ever need the lovin'
And another dream is comin'
If you ever need the lovin'
I'll be with you on the money

Love has a broken rule
It always make a fool of anyone
Who wants to play
If you're not smart you'll find
You just might get left behind
So hold on to these words I say

If you ever need the lovin'
And another dream is comin'
If you ever need the lovin'
I'll be with you on the money

Oh I think your style's great
For you I'm gonna wait
'Cause I know that it will be mine
And on some golden day
When you won't turn my love away
And hold on to these words I say

If you ever need the lovin'
And another dream is comin'
If you ever need the lovin'
I'll be with you on the money

If there ever was a fool
I think inside my head it's you
A voice inside should say
Our love could be greater, ooh
Our love could be so very greater, ooh
So what you gonna do, I'm in love with you What you gonna do, don't you want me too
What you gonna do, I'm in love with you
What you gonna do, don't you want me too

If there ever was a fool
I think inside my head it's you
A voice inside should say
Our love could be greater, ooh
Our love could be so very greater, ooh
So what you gonna do, I'm in love with you What you gonna do, don't you want me too
What you gonna do, I'm in love with you
What you gonna do, don't you want me too

// Sharing Love //

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

As always just when the feeling's right
You give your lovin' to me
And hold me tight, my life
You still get filled with pain
Until I meet you Monday
And learn to love again, oh

Oh little girl I'm talkin' to you
Just tryin' to tell you I love you too

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

I think you're perfect as you are in my life
You're my shining star
Oh girl, don't ever leave me alone
Stay with me baby, you know I need you so

Hey little girl I'm talkin to you
Just tryin' to tell you I love you too

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

Sharing love, take a look around you...
