// Real People //

Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

Throughout this
Great big world of ours
There are so many folks
Who just can't get involved

Now they receive you readily
And will deceive you dreadfully
Oh, yeah, it's a reality

I'll just do my best, yeah
To to try and make all those
Phony relationships dissolve

Now I suppose
They could help themselves
So I grow close to surround myself
With love and humanity

So I whistle

Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

I don't think my emotion could stand
All of this wear and tear
They say you control your own destiny
But I can't take them getting the best
They're getting the best of me

Spread out
Give me some elbow room
And some place where

Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people

Some real people

// I Loved You More //

I loved you more than words could tell
Oh I loved you more than words
Seems like we all live
All alone for ourselves
Seems like we all live for ourselves
But how can we say "live"
When these hearts of ours can't give
Any love to the ones
That you hold so very dear

I loved you more than words could say
Oh I loved you more than words
If you see the stains
When you look at my face
If you see the stains on my face

Tears are not only bad
Sometimes they come when I'm glad
And I'm glad when I think
Of the love that we had

Now I know you've known
Other lost souls like me
That lived their lives
In search of peaches and cream
If all this cold world
Has to offer are dreams
Rescue me, oh please, oh please

I loved you more

// I Got Protection //

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection

Not gonna run, you son-of-a-gun
I am not afraid of you
Any time you want a showdown
You've been through every girl in town
Havin' fun, you're number one
Now I think it's time to slow down

You could never break my heart
Oh no, I have spoke to my connection
I bet you think you're pretty smart
Let's see how you can take rejection

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection

Monkey see and monkey do
So the fellows imitate you
They think you're so together
All the girls wanna be with you
So cool that you fool them all
But that won't last forever

I think you met your match in me
Maybe in time you'll change your direction
Be honest with yourself
Recognize all your faults
And try to correct them

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection, ooh

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection, ooh

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection, ooh

I've got protection from your infection
I've got protection, got to pass my inspection
I've got protection, ooh

// Rebels Are We //

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we

Life's a switch, don't let it play a trick on you
Try not to be fooled, be wise
Don't throw a fit, stay calm and you'll be cool
You'll find a solution right before your eyes

I know much more now that I'm older
Just a little bolder, listen to me
We can't give up, now that we're movin'
The whole world's groovin', we must stay free

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we

Don't cage us in, we might just surprise you
In order to convince you, we will
Oh, no, you can't take away our freedom
And get this straight, for that we won't be still

The time is now and if we have to fight
Come on let's unite, we got to do it soon
We're gonna win, on that you can depend
'Cause if you don't, me and my baby are goin' to the moon

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free

My baby and me
Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

Rebels
Rebels

Rebels, baby
Rebels
Rebels, baby
Rebels

Rebels, baby
Rebels
Rebels, baby
Rebels

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we
My baby and me

We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free
My baby and me

Nevertheless
Rebels are we

// Chip Off The Old Block //

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

He's so sharp, bright and smooth
It's a pleasure just to know him
He's a graduate from the old school
Of hard knocks, the sly fox

The carbon copy of his father
If you didn't like his pa, don't bother
Some of us think these qualities are grim
To be just like the one before him

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

It's so hard to resist him
And the fact is that he knows it
He doesn't have to be persistent
In his whole make up he shows it

Don't trust your woman's intuition
I'm guilty by my own admission
Now that he's got me in his clutches
I'm walking around with my heart on crutches

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

The program to make a man
A simple plan that surely can
Make humans act synthesized
I think he's homogenized

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

He's a chip off the old block
Just like a robot, he'll do for you
What he's programmed to
He's a chip off the old block

// 26 //

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

What's this I hear about these perfect 10s
My colleagues squawk about
Them Ritzy girl friends
A hundred pounds, a hundred pounds of trash
They talk to me, they ramble on in my ears
And their conversation's boring
I would bet anyone 50 dollars
'Cause I only wagon on the surest things
Anywhere, anywhere she would go
I would follow 500 miles away from home
Just for a fling, for a fling

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

I haven't known too many women
Throughout my less than lustrous career
But of all the relationships I've been in
To my 26 the others can't compare
She's my best bosom buddy, she's my partner
In the things I find important to share
She is fine, incredibly fine, it's no wonder
That she catches, that she catches all the stares

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

// You Can't Do It Alone //

The me decade is gone
You can't do it alone, no
You'll find out like the rest
Girl it's your life
Go on and live it to its fullest
You said you needed a little room to grow
Got things you want to do
Places you want (like) to go to
Don't hesitate, no, not for my sake (girl)

You can't do it alone, listen to me
Everybody needs a home
Was it worth it, tell me girl
To lose your love just to find yourself

And even though it's late
I still wish you would wait
(Oh) girl let's try love again
You never know
I used to have the love
That made your head spin
You know I still feel sad
I never treated you bad (oh) no
If this is what you want
Go out and get it, don't slow down
And don't look back

Ooh baby

You can't do it alone, listen to me
Everybody needs a home
Was it worth it, tell me girl
To lose your love just to find yourself

The me decade is gone
You can't do it alone, no
You'll find out like the rest
Girl it's your life
Go on and live it to its fullest
You said you needed a little room to grow
Got things you want to do
Places you want (like) to go to
Don't hesitate, no, not for my sake (girl)

And even though it's late
I still wish you would wait
(Oh) girl let's try love again
You never know
I used to have the love
That made your head spin
You know I still feel sad
I never treated you bad (oh) no
If this is what you want
Go out and get it, don't slow down
And don't look back
