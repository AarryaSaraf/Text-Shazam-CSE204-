// Holly Holy //

Holly holy eyes
Dream of only you
Well I am what I am,
what I believe in
Holly holy

Holly holy dreams
Wanting only you
Yes she comes
And I run just like the wind will
Holly holy

Sing, sing a song
Sing, sing a song of songs
Sing, sing it out loud
We'll sing a song
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah - yeah

Call the sun in the dead of the night
And the sun will rise in the sky
Touch a man who can't walk upright
And the lame man, will be alright

And I fly
And I fly

Holly holy eyes
Wanting only you
And I see, will it be for everyone

Holly holy

// It's My Delight //

I love you like I want you
And I kiss you like I need you
Every night
I'll draw you close to me
I'll tell you words of comfort
It's my delight

Darling I've grown to love you
More every day
And I've got a song to sing
Each lonely night, oh yeah, oh yeah

Stronger than the north winds
Higher than the mountains
That's my love for you
Nor will I forsake you
Darling be true
It's only a matter of time, oh yeah
Then all of my dreams will come true
In every way, oh yeah oh yeah

Stronger than the north winds
Higher than the mountains
That's my love for you
Nor will I forsake you
Darling be true
It's only a matter of time, oh yeah
Then all of my dreams will come true
In every way, oh yeah oh yeah

// Never Let You Go //

[Chorus:]
I will never let you go
I will never
I will never let you go
I will never

I've got to hold on, every day
In every way, but the things you will say
Just couldn't be that way
You'll never, ever reach
If you don't try
Instead you keep on telling all
Those dreadful lies

Just wait and see
How things could be
When I am free
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus

[Chorus]

I've got to hold on, every day
In every way, but the things you will say
Just couldn't be that way
You'll never, ever reach
If you don't try
Instead you keep on telling all
Those dreadful lies

Just wait and see
How things could be
When I am free
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus

I've never let you go
I'll always try
And I've got so much soul
You'll wonder why
It's just because
I'm so true
You'll be feeling blue
When I get through
There is nothing you can do

[Repeat last verse]

// Soul Rebel //

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See the morning sun, on the hillside
Not living good, yeah
You better travel wide
You better travel wide
Said I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
I said, you must be blue

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time
Soul rebel
I'm a capturer
Soul adventurer

See the morning sun, on the hillside
Not living good, yeah
You better travel wide
You better travel wide
Said I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
I said, you must be blue

I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time
Soul rebel
I'm a capturer
Soul adventurer

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

// My Best Girl //

I'm gonna tell my friends about you
Tell them about the things that you do to me
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be
Tell them you're everything that's good so good to me

I want to be always close to you
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need
I want to be always close to you
Don't have to try you out for size
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm
The only one I have no doubt no fear about
Without you what would my life be

I want to be always close to you
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need
I want to be always so close to you
I want to be always close to you
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need
I want to be always close to you
Don't have to try you out for size
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm
The only one I have no doubt no fear about
Without you what would my life be
Without you what would my life be

Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be

// Good Ambition //

I've spent eleven months and five days loving you
And all these times I've spent forgiving you
I don't want to be hurt
I don't want to be hurt
I don't want to be hurt
Not any more

I'm a man with a good ambition
And I will never let you drag me down
You better go home and leave me alone

I'm a man with a good ambition
And I will never let you drag me down
So baby go home
And leave me alone

I've got a good, good, good ambition
Tell you it's a good, good, good ambition

I've got a good, good, good ambition
Tell you it's a good, good, good ambition
I've got a good, good, good ambition
Tell you it's a good, good, good ambition

// The Train Is Coming //

I said, the train is coming baby
I said, the train is comin' now
I said, the train is coming baby
I said, the train is comin' now

So long I've been waiting
Waiting for you, oh yeah
Now the time has come
And its between me and you, oh Lord'

I said, the train is coming baby
The train is comin' now, now, now, now
I said, the train is coming baby
And I am leaving on that train, Lord

Everyday I pray
For this little hour
Now the time has come
And I want you to stand by me
Because the train is comin' baby
And we are leaving on that train
And we will roam this land
Where we all will be free, Lord

// Blood And Fire //

Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire

There is no more water to out the fire
There is no more water to out the fire
Let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, burn burn
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire

Judgement has come and mercy has gone (mercy come and gone)
Ooh, weak hearts shall lick up and spit up (weakheart must get lick up)
Judgement has come and mercy has gone (judgement time is here)
Ooh, weak hearts shall lick up and spit up (weakheart must get sick up)

Let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, burn burn (mercy gone)

Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Rasta Hail!

Blessed is the weed, the healing of all nations in every corner of the earth
Blessed are the fields of sensimillia that enlighten and erich our soul
Blood and fire mek it burn bredren

All weak hearts shall lick up and spit up
And all righteous shall stand
Hail, Rasta hail and wail (rastafari)
Hail Rasta don't quail (we not quail)

Let it burn, burn burn
Let it burn, burn burn

// Mr. Fix It //

If you're feeling lonely
Cause your one and only
Boy has found a girl
And gone away
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there

If your heart's been shattered
The pieces are scattered
All across the ground
Of loneliness
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there

Love is not a bed of roses
And life is not a game, it seems
If you're being mistreated by your lover
Then darlin', come see me

And if you're feeling lonely
Cause your one and only
Boy has found a girl
And gone away
Just you reach for the phone
I'll be there at home
My name is Fix It
And I'll be there
I'll be there

// Stay A Little Bit Longer //

Stay a little bit longer
Hold on I'm coming
Stay a little bit longer
Hold on I'm coming

It's getting late darling
What will your mamma say

Stay a little bit longer
Hold on I'm coming
Stay a little bit longer
Hold on I'm coming
Stay a little bit longer
Hold on I'm coming - that's what she said
Don't fight, you better not fight it

// Someone Like You //

There must be some place we can go
There must be someone that you know
Where can I go, and who you know worries me, oh Lord

Where can I find someone like you, to love
Where can I find someone like you, my love

There must be something we can try
There must be some things we can find
What can I try, and how to get by worries me, oh Lord

Where can I find someone like you, to love
Where can I find someone like you, oh my love

// The Time Has Come //

There is no time to sit around and wait
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
To be free can't you see

Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo

Don't you know the cheating, killing, backbiting cannot help
Cos' can't you see them problems, it's everyday
They've got to solve themselves
Cos' now is the time, we gotta be strong
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
To be free can't you see

Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo
Shup doo doop, shup doo doop doop doo doo doo

There is no time to sit around and wait
Don't you know the world, it is of love and of hate
We can't go wrong
Because the time has come, the time has come
To be free can't you see

// Crying Over You //

Crying over you in the morning
Crying over you in the evening
Crying over you, don't know what to do
You make me feel ashamed, people say
It's all in the game, woman please let me explain
Then I know you will be mine

Everyday I pray
To have you and to hold
Now that you are here by my side
I really, really don't want to cry, cry

Crying over you in the morning
Crying over you in the evening
Crying over you, don't know what to do

You make me feel ashamed, people say
It's all in the game, woman please let me explain
Then I know you will be mine

And I will stop crying, crying over you
And I will stop sighing, sighing, don't know what to do
Dying, dying, every day
Sighing, sighing
