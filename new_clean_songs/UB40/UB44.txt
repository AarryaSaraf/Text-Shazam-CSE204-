// So Here I Am //

Seven on a Monday morning.
And it's a sunny day.
It's just too hot to be working
But you've got to pay your way.

[Chorus:]
So here I am sitting at the bus stop
Wishing I was somewhere else
Where I didn't have to work my rocks off
Wishing I could please myself.

Ten hours a day I'm grafting
Under the bosses eye,
Earn just enough to keep going,
Making cars I'll never buy.

[Chorus]

Five days a week I'm giving,
My time is clocking on.
Just two days left for living,
Wondering where my life has gone.

[Chorus]

// I Won't Close My Eyes //

I won't close my eyes
To the sufferers plight.
In a world full of sadness
I won't turn off my light.

Our cries for justice are shots in the dark
But our strength's in our bite
And not in our bark
It's time to stand
And shout it out loud
And the louder we scream
The sweeter the sound.

I won't close my eyes
When I know that I'm right
When I'm drowning in tears
I won't turn off my light.

We're shown no respect
But that can't break our pride,
When our backs to the wall
We won't run and we won't hide
It's time to stand, face the oncoming crowd
And the louder we scream
The sweeter the sound.

I wont't close my eyes
When the future don't look bright
Though the road seems too long
I won't turn off my light
In a world full of darkness,
I won't turn off my light.

// Forget The Cost //

Multi-million dollar
Exploration into space
While in the name of progress
This planet's laid to waste
Nation takes on nation
And is stepping up the pace
And someone's got his finger
On the button.

[Chorus:]
Forget the cost
We've got to choose
We're running in a race
That we can only lose.

Rich is rich and poor is poor
And never the twain shall meet
East is east and west is west
And only one shall eat
The microchip has come of age
And man is obsolete
And someone's got his finger
On the button.

[Chorus]

// Love Is All Is Alright //

[Chorus:]
Love Is all is alright
But you left it a little to late
Love is all is alright
But you've got to find a little more hate.

Take the man in the white cloak
A pointed mask to hide his face
Murders in the name of religion
If you're not the right colour or race.
Take the man in the black cloak
He's holding justice in his hands,
Lets the man in the white cloak go,
Calls it the law of the land.

[Chorus]

Take the man in the brown shirt
A burning hatred in his eyes
Fired by ignorant reaction,
Fanned by political lies
Take the man in the blue cap
His back's against the wall
Links arms with the man in the brown shirt
He's trying to break his own fall.

[Chorus]

// The Piper Calls The Tune //

He wields his flute with an expert hand
And then, all too soon
The dancing stops and the children stand
The piper calls the tune.

He holds their future in his palm
An old and powerful man
With missiles poised and bombs at hand
They wait for his command.

With songs of fear and bigotry
A cruel, hypnotic sound
He plays his last tune greedily
And strikes the children down.

// The Key //

Trenchtown Jamaica
Gave the Wailers their soun'
Like a steppin' razor
The Brother Tosh 'im come aroun'
Yellow Man and Eek-A-Mouse
Dem a trod 'pon newer groun'
While Scratch and The Scientist
Dem jus' keep on mixin' down.

The mighty General and Eastwood
Draw me out of my seat
The Lone Ranger ride in
To rock me' pon me feet
The dreaded Flabba Holt and Style Scott
Start fe put down a radical beat
Wid Mistra Isaacs
Puttin' melodies so sweet.

[Ad lib]

[Refrain:]
Reggae music is
The key to ny heart
Reggae music is
My stop and start
From dusk to dawn
The music is my high.

// Don't Do The Crime //

Don't do the crime,
If you can`t do the time
It's said that it just don't pay.
But what good's working hard
When all they give you is your cards
And you know there's not much you can say.

So you take what they give
You've no money to live
And your family don't understand.
After all these years
They will end up in tears
With a mountain of bills in their hands.

Now your lesson is learned
There's nowhere to turn
And it's no use pleading for help.
When you're left on the heap
There is nothing to keep you
From going and helping yourself

The dilemma you've found
Is you`re morally bound
Now your moral code needs a review
So what do you care
You know life isn't fair
And for years they've been stealing from you.

// Folitician //

Hey Folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
Mek you go long so.
Hey folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
Mek you go long so.

You come chatty chatty chatty run up you' mouth; [Repeat]
One man, one vote you hear from the shout. [Repeat]

You full of pure promise but you tell damn' lies; [Repeat]
You make a mistake And then somebody dies. [Repeat]

Hey folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
What you doin 'bout the slums?
You sit around all day, jus' a twiddle your thumbs;
You have a strange expression
Mek you look like you' dumb. [Repeat]

You worry everybody 'til you put them in a box. [Repeat]

Dub freak gone
Gone go check him record shop,
Gone go check him record stock.

Him climb upon the box
Him said him got to reach the top;
Him climb upon the shelf
Him seh you take care yourself.
Him dance upon the floor
Him said a music galore. [Repeat]

Dub freak, dub freak
Deh 'pon the go;
Say you never know
Because I told you so.

Sippa, sippa, sippa, sippa, lightning crash; [Repeat]
Drummer 'pon him drum, him jus' a play mish-mash. [Repeat]
Keyboards in the middle jus'a jump and twiddle. [Repeat]
Rhythm over here an' me seh rhythm over there;
Don't stop and stare because the rhythm gone clear.

Dub freak, dub freak, in a dub freak style
Dub freak, dub freak, still a running wild.
Him start from the bottom 'til him reach up the top
Him keep on rocking and him never stop.
Wow and flutter, music just a run like butter. [Repeat]

Dub a slip an' slide
Dub a slip an' slide
Dub a slip an' slide,
He can't find nowhere to hide.

// The Prisoner //

A misfit who is old before his time
Poverty has turned him to crime
Boredom gives him too much time to think
He pours another drink.

A burning, bitter taste of irony
A prisoner in the land of the free.

He wonders why his landscape looks so strange
Burger bars are home on the range
An empty bottle falling from his hand
He doesn't understand.

A burning, bitter taste of irony
A prisoner in the land of the free.

A cork unlocks the door to other lands
Of battles won and destinies in hand
A half-remembered state of liquid dreams
Where things aren't what they seem.

A burning, bitter taste of irony
A prisoner in the land of the free.

A naked savage dressed in shirt and jeans

A burning, bitter taste of irony
A prisoner in the land of the free.

A burning, bitter taste of irony
A prisoner in the land of the free.
