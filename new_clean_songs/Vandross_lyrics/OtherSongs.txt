// Got You Home //

I Am Glad That You Accepted
My Offer To You When I Said, Excuse Me Miss? What's Your Name?
That Was The Spark That Lit The Flame
You Won't Be Regrettin It
I Promise You'd Be Satisfied
So Relax, Cause Everything Gonna Be Alright

[Chorus:]
Girl I'm Glad I Got You Tonite Nite Nite Nite
Finally We All Alone Tonite Nite Nite Nite
I'm Gonna Turn Down The Lights I'll Give You What You Like, Girl I'm Glad That I Got You Home, Now That I Got You Home Tonite

First Let Me Take Your Coat Off
And Let Me Show You All Around And If You Need Something I Think You Ought To Get It Now
We'll Be Busy Doing Whatever's Cool
And I Don't Want Interupptions Between Me And You

[Chrous]

I Can't Imagine Being In Another Place
Except With You Face To Face
I Can't Imagine Being In Another Place
Expect With You Face To Face

Cause I've Been Waiting
So Long For This Moment To Come
And Now Your Here
In My Arms

[Chorus]

Girl I Got You Home And I
I Got You Home And Now Babe
I Got You  Home My Babe
I Got You Home Alright
I Got You Home I Got You
I Got You Home And Now Babe
I Got You Home
I Got You Home

[Chorus]

// Heart Of A Hero //

Hero, Hero

Someone above keeps sendin' us love
He wants us to love each other
You see, the more we give, the better we live
Lets help the world of the future

We're singin', oh happy day
This life is for us
Life without love is a zero
(Come on, sing it together!)
Oh happy day, I heard someone say
inside every heart is a hero
You're a hero

If you're a friend to every man,
you're that much closer to Heaven
Heaven knows the love we share, God wants us to care
Think of the world we'll be getting

Keep singing, oh happy day
This world is for us, 
The world without love is a zero
(There ain't nothin' to it!)
Oh happy day, give love to someone
and you'll have the heart of a hero
You're a hero

Sometimes a hero doesn't know he's a hero
and that's the beauty of sharing love
And it doesn't take superman,
just plain ordinary people,
trying to give someone a hand, if they can
TOGETHER

Oh happy day, thank GOD for his love
cuz life with no love is a zero
(Come on, sing it together!)
Oh happy day, give love to someone
and you'll have the heart of a hero
(oh yes you will!)

Oh happy day, life is for us
cuz life without love is a zero
(I wanna hear everybody say)
Oh happy day, I've heard someone say
that inside every heart is a hero
You're a hero
Say it! Hero

// I'd Rather //

I thought sometime alone
was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
and I tried to find
out if this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
and thought she could replace you
we got a long just fine
we wasted time because she was not you
we had a lot of fun
though we knew we were faking
love was not impressed with our connection built on lies, all lies
so I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you,
I can only prove the things I say with time,
please be mine,

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you,
than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime),
than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
I'd rather have hard times to gether,
than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)

I'd rather have bad times with you (surely),
than good times with someone else (surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah),
than safe and warm by myself (all by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together,
than to have it easy apart (you know it)
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart

I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoooo.....who holds my heart

// She's So Good To Me //

After the dance, I walked my baby home under the moonlight,
It was a scene right from my fantasy.
She said the thing that made me wanna say how much I love her,
Don't love no other.
It couldn't be... ooh ooh ooh
She's so good to me.

And when the morning came around,
Well she had not let me down...she was still my lover.
I must confess that I put love to the test to see if there was any other,
She proved to me what a real good love she'd be and she was so excited.
Deep in her eyes was the promise of the love that I'd been dreamin' of,
She made me love the world...so I know she's my girl... oh oh oh oh oh oh.

I'm on a cloud where no one is allowed except my lady,
High as can be... she's so good to me.
Uhh... I don't care or know what the people down below think bout' my baby,
Maybe I'm crazy... but it's ecstasy... yeah yeah... she's so good to me.

She's so very fine and I love her... hey... and I love her.
She's the one I see...yes I love her...yes I love her.
When I dream all day and night no one else could be so right,
She's so good to me.

Yeah yeah... she's the world for me..said a one, two three,
She's my fantasy... yes I love her... yes I love her.
When the whole world let's me down with people jivin' me around,
She's so truly good to me.

[Bridge:]
When my lady, love and I always have a real good time,
Just the three of us.
We never stop till hands up on the clock say the night is up.
We see the sun and then the fun has just begun cause it's a brand new day... yeah yeah.
I hurry through of the things I've got to do and then I'm on the way... yeah,
That together love I been daydreaming of ...oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

I don't agree... they say that every lover has got to change,
How can it be... she's so good to me?
Now...they say that suddenly she'll start to acting strange,
She's gonna change.
No not my baby... she's so good to me.

She's so very fine and I love her... hey... and I love her.
She's the one I see...yes I love her...yes I love her.
When I dream all day and night no one else could be so right,
She's so good to me.

Yeah yeah... she's the world for me... said a one, two three,
She's my fantasy...yes I love her... yes I love her.
When the whole world let's me down with people driving me around,
She's so truly good to me... so good to me.
She's so very fine...and I love her... six, seven, eight, nine...fade!

// The Thrill I'm In //

Hey ay...

Look, Heart, please don't you fail on me now, keep your composure somehow
Beaten down, cause your movin' much too fast
You, you smiled and from the first glance I didn't stand half a chance
No-contest in the battle with you hypnotizing loveliness

I lose all control, around and around I spin, head over heels
I don't know which way is up
But there's one thing I do know, that each day I want you more and more
Now I've tasted the potion, I'm under the spell of the magic we call love
And I can't get enough of...

Feels so good babe from the start, and it feels so good to be wrapped in your arm
Oh, I feel the thrill of new found love, and I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

Hey ay ay ayee...

Flash, wavin' a full surrender, to love you give so tender
Soft serenade of your voice when you come near and whisper

I lose all control, around and around I spin, head over heels
I don't know which way is up
Cause there's no place I'd rather be
Then somewhere I go just you and me
Cause I've tasted the potion, I'm under the spell of the magic we call love
And I can't get enough of...

Feels so good babe from the start, and it feels so good to be wrapped in your arm
Oh, I feel the thrill of new found love, and I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

Feels so good babe, from the start and it feels so good said it feels so good
It's the thrill I feel of a new found love. And I don't want to lose this feeling
Fix me in the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in, the thrill I'm in

I don't know how she puts me in a spin
I lost my heart to her but I still win
Every time I'm wrapped up in her arm

Ayy ayy hey...

It's the thrill, feels alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright

It's the thrill, feels alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright, I feel alright

It's the thrill, feels alright
I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright...

// There's Only You //

I've been missing you and
I don't know what there is for me to do,
But hope and wish and pray
Love will find it's way from me to you one day
And I would stay inside your world forever more

There's no place to hide. I could never run,
From what I feel inside.
Seems all I have is you, and I want to make
You love me deep and true.
And if you do, I want to learn to be a part of you

When there's no one to believe in
My fantasies run wild.
I make it easy on myself.
I just dream of how the world would be
If there were only you and me and no one else.

I could easily believe in love 'cause
You would never let me down.
You bring such happiness to me
And to prove how true my love would be,
I'd hold you very high, for the world to see.

I'll be missing you,
And I don't know what there is for me to do,
But I'll remember you.
It seems I'm in the world alone with only you.
For me to love, and to be loved
There's only you
There is only you

// When You Call On Me / Baby That's When I Come Runnin' //

Especially when I'm alone myself

Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
When you call on me (Yeah...)

Now I lay me down to sleep and hope that heaven hears my heart
Send me someone right now

(When you call on me, babe) When you call on me (Hey...)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)

When you call on me (Yeah...hey...)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'
(I'll come runnin' to you, baby)

Oh, I promise when you fall asleep
At night I will be there
To cuddle you in love
And show you that I care

It doesn't take much for me to know when a woman's lonely
Especially when I'm alone myself
If there's anyone out there who needs love like I need love
Just hold on and I'll be right there

(When you call on me, babe) When you call on me
