Album: IKnow

// Keeping My Faith In You //

I just love how long we've known each other
And I know you care about me
But I can't tell just where your life is going
You've been quite a mystery
You've got all of these brand new friends
They keep taking your confidence

But I'm keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
You've been worried, puzzled, surrounded by your trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you

We all cried when your first bow was taken
No one could be prouder of you
But I care more about your heart if it's aching
If I'm your friend, what else can I do?
But those people who hang around
They keep bringing your spirit down

But I'm keeping my faith in you, yeah
Deep in my heart of hearts
If anyone can do it
I know you'll get through it
So I'm keeping my faith in you

I've known you ever since way back when
And I know you, you don't want to change, my friend
But you're under pressure, like no one could imagine
It's not a good time that you've been having
But you're a real strong brother, and I know you'll recover
So I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
If anyone can do it
I know you'll get through it
So I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
Keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts

You've been worried, puzzled
Surrounded by big trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you
My faith in you
Keeping my faith in you
My faith in you
Keeping my faith in you
My faith in you

// Isn't There Someone //

Another sad day, another lonely day
For all we know some people only cry
They have no good times, no poetry rhymes
They don't know how or when or if or why
Why the goodness never stays
Or why love didn't come again today

Isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble
Isn't there someone who sees
I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love
I can be the someone that you need

I know you dream at night and lay your feelings down
And you wish your life could be more like your dreams
What a moonlit sound, your voice is not too loud
But somehow I hear it coming through to me
I pray you hang on to your dream
And I hope it gives you all the love you need
You need

Isn't there someone who knows that you're hurting
Is there someone to believe
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love
I can be the someone that you need

Don't you miss love, I know I often do
That's why I'm pulling you closer to me
But like anything you can't see
It's just a little harder to believe

Isn't there someone who loves you completely
Isn't there someone like me
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love
I can be the someone that you need
I can be the someone that you need

// Religion //

It was early Sunday morning
Everyone in the house was still asleep
She made some toast and coffee
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet
She said, "I don't want a bus ride,
I believe that the walk might help me think
Got a heart kind of heavy
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!"

Religion
That's my decision
Some of that "make me feel better when I shout!!!" religion
That's my decision

Papa Henry was full of spice
He was a man usually nice
But something got into him last night
Made him want to fuss and hollar
The entire house was in a sweat
His bottle got broken and the floor got wet
"Clean it up!" you could hear him scream
Then he said, "I'm going out"
I need religion

Religion
That's my decision
Some of that "raise up the roof, 90 proof" religion
That's my decision
Religion
It's my decision, oh yes it is
That's my decision

It's the story about a good family
Who doesn't live anymore in good harmony
They are people who love their daughter and son
They try to give them religion

Little Billy likes his best friend Jack
How in the world could he be like that
Mama and Henry wanna have that chat
Boy, you need religion

Little Betty, whatcha gonna do?
There's a child growing inside of you 
You should've stopped and thought things through
Little girl you need a vision of religion

Religion
And that's my decision
Some of that "how'd I get on Rikki Lake" religion
That's my decision
Religion
Get a little, 
Religion
Get a little
Religion

// Get It Right //

[Precise]
Morning
Some of y'all may think 
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

[Luther]
Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

[1] - Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

[Precise]
Get all up in your back and down your spine
Got to keep it on track like the A train line
To the junction out in Brooklyn
What's your function
Keep you lookin' once again
As I punch in those lines like the SV-1200
Precise on the mic, you
But we gon' get top shot at the party
Started rockin'
And I got first dibs on the dark skinned kid

[Luther]
And I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Do it till you get it right

[Repeat 1]

[2] - Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right
Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right

And oh, don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop
Oh, and let's reach for the sky
And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up
And don't you worry
No, you won't use up your stuff
No way to get enough
Do it till we get it right
And even if it takes from morning till way into night
We got to

[Repeat 1]

Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get it
Stay with it and get it right
Never stop, Luther take ya to the tpo
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

[Precise]
How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air If you're getting it right
What we got you'll like
But it's not quite the regular jam
Luther and Precise
How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air if you're getting it right
What we got you'll like 
But it's not quite your regular jam
Luther and Precise

[Repeat 2]

// I Know //

I know that you've been good to me
And I know it's just a rumor spreading in this town
And I know know know it's a thing I don't believe
Cuz you know I'd never let you down baby
This is love that you see on my face
And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

[1] - But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love
(Honey don't you see?)

I know about their jealousy
And I know about the talk that's growing in this town
And I know know know that they don't want to believe
That I'm not just a run-around baby
They say we will break up, just you wait
They gamble on the time and the date it will end
Not much longer, they swear
You see everybody's talking, I hear rumors everywhere

[Repeat 1]

I don't believe what they think of you and me
When they say that we're in trouble
Cuz they don't know what they're talking about
It's just too bad we've got what they've never had
So they just stay busy talking
"She don't love him, he don't love her!"

[Repeat 1]

I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real big heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
Cuz nothing's gonna stop us

[Ad lib until fade]

// I'm Only Human //

I'm only human baby
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes
You put your guilt on me
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah
Making me the human that I am

[Bob James]
Won't you forgive me baby
I'm only human baby
Won't you forgive me for that?
Won't you forgive me baby
I'm only human baby
Won't you forgive me for that?

Your love can be so strong
It makes it hard to give some back
So I try and I try and I give and I give
And I get so darn excited I can't relax
Making me the human that I am

[Repeat 1]

When we search for love
We must be lucky, baby
And it's because there are many people in the world
Who think love is not that necessary
I had you and I blew it all

[Repeat 1]

And now I know for sure
I must be lucky baby
You chose me out of all the people in the world
And I think love is very necessary
You've forgiven me after all
Cuz I let you know

[Repeat 1]

Just like you, my love
Just like you, my baby
Just like you, my love
Just like you, my baby
If you forgive, if you forgive me too

// Nights In Harlem //

There's a party in Harlem, come on

I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere one night in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
Cuz Sylvia's would burn all night

The people there were really something
(You know that's right)
The music always kept us jumping
And it used to knock me down
When Smokey came to town
(And the miracles, please)
My favorite song was "Tears Of A Clown", oh yeah

There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
And I'm gonna take my baby back
To the heart of Harlem

Big sister had a group 
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drove them "B" girls wild

But when grandma started happy dancing
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')
She really turned the mother out
I like the way they do it up in Harlem
When there's a party up in Harlem
That's what it's all about

Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo

There's a party in Harlem
They say that all the stars will be there
Everyone is going to Harlem
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there

[Precise]
Follow me visually, cuz I usually be all around
Originallly everybody headed uptown
Finessing the fly way you crisin in your car
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R
And yes, we are about to set it
Forget it, I thought you knew
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance
Who frontin' nonchallant up in the restaurant
What you really really want, we grabbin by the clutch
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much
It's such a love flow, high but natural
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool

Nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem

Nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
Back to the Harlem Apollo

Nights in Harlem
They don't let you fake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my honey
Back to the Harlem Apollow

Nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my baby
Back to the Harlem Apollo

// Dream Lover //

Dream lover please be mine
I love you every night
Dream lover where are you?
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh
Dream lover of my dreams
I only see you when I dream my dream
I love you endlessly
I wake up nervous in a sweat
Don't ever wake me up
Don't wake me up
Dream lover you're the only one I love

It's only you who satisfies me
You mesmerize and mystify me
I'll never get this feeling from any other
And I really miss you in the morning

Dream lover you and I
Are two lovers of the night
Dream lover hope you see
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh
Dream lover of my dreams
I only see you when I dream my dream
I love you endlessly
I wake up nervous in a sweat
Don't ever wake me up
Don't wake me up
Dream lover you're the only one I love

How I wish that I could keep you
But I'll just see you when I see you
I wish the night would last just a little longer
Cuz I really miss you when it's morning

After each night, the day seems long
For dream lovers who wait to rush into each other's arms
It's you that keeps me dreaming

Dream lover please be mine
I love you every night
Dream lover where are you?
You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh
Dream lover of my dreams
I only see you when I dream my dream
I love you endlessly
I wake up nervous in a sweat
Don't ever wake me up
Don't wake me up
Dream lover you're the only one I..

Love of my love
Dream of my dream

[Repeat above until fade]

// When I Need You //

No one knows the side of you that I know
No one gets to see, to feel you
To hear you when they call
I'm the only one you answer
Because I know what to do
I know what to do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
Is only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
Is only a heartbeat away

It's not easy when the road is your driver
But honey that's the heavy load that we bear
But I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
When I need you 

But I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, oh honey, hold out
And do like I do

When I need you 
I just close my eyes and I'm with you baby
And all that I so want to give you 
Is only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Honey, when I need you 

I'm in a cloud and I'm holding my hand out to you
Holding my hand out to you
Holding my hand out for you

// Are You Using Me? //

Wait a minute
Let's try something different
This is Luther
With the masters at work

Last night I had some trouble sleeping..

[1] - Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?
Are you, are you, are you using me?

No more will I let it be
You called his name out in your sleep
You're doing things so suspiciously
And I think that you're using me, yeah

Don't hang on me for security
Love is never free
Are you using me?

[Repeat 1]

You pretended like we were friends
I was blinded by sentiment
You complicated what love should be
And I could swear that you're using me

I keep seeing things I shouldn't see
I've been watchin' you 
Are you using me?

Are you, are you
Are you using me?

Listen, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Ooh, come on now and talk to me, talk to me
Hey talk to me, talk to me
Hey talk to me, talk to me

For my money, for my money
For my money, for my money
For my money, for my money
(Tell the truth)
For my money, for my money

[Repeat 1]

For my body, for my body
For my body, for my body
For my body, for my body
For my body, for my body

Don't hang on to me for security
Love is never free, tell me are you

Using, using me, using, are you using me
Using, using me, using, are you using me?

I keep seeing things I should not see
I've been watching you, are you using me?

One time, one time (one time, one time)
One time, one time (one time, one time)
One time, one time (one time, tell me)
One time, one time (It's my desire)
Don't be such a liar

[Ad lib until fade]

// Are You Mad At Me? //

I was lost until the day I found you 
And I know you know
There's not a thing for you that I wouldn't do
But, yesterday was rough on me
I was under the weather
So my dear, I didn't have much to say

And I rushed you off of the phone last night
So I called you back to apologize
But your line stayed busy through the night, you see
And it makes me wonder
Are you mad at me?

I was right to fall in love this way
And one thing's for sure
The angels smiled on me 
When you came my way
So my dear, tonight's the night
It's gonna be special
I can't wait to see the face of my love

But even though I tried, sorry I was late
And I understand that you couldn't wait
But you're pulling back, honey I can see
And it makes me worry
Are you mad at me?

I wish I could be perfect for you
Can't you see how hard I try?

When you talk to me I can hear the pain
When I look in your face I can see the strain
And I can hear the cries of the willow tree
Something's wrong I know it
Are you mad at me?

[Ad lib until fade]

// Now That I Have You //

You found me when I was alone
You held me and you made my heart your home
I sit around and dream
And there's no one else I see
Cuz there's no one else for me
I don't feel like crying

[1] - I have no tears
Cuz I have no reason to cry
Love is on my mind
And my heart's no longer blue
Now that I have you

I don't let anyone tell me what to do
How to love, who to love
They don't know you like I know you
This is so natural, it's hard to believe
People all around me
And there's no one else I see
Cuz there's no one else for me
I don't feel like crying

[Repeat 1]

I have the world, and I have no fears
And I know where my happiness is
Now that I've got you to care
Now that you've got me forever
Everything I don't want is gone
And I know I can't live without your love

All the things I wanted now
Are starting to be true
And all the dreams I ever dreamed
Are coming now that I have you 
Love is on my mind
And my heart's no longer blue
Now that I have you 
Oh, now that I have you
Now that I have you

// Nights In Harlem (A Darkchild Extended Remix) //

[Guru]
In the big apple, scars embedded like tattoos
Ghetto love, protection from what's coming at you
Keeping our heads up, maintaining self esteem
And reminiscing on the Harlem Nights scene
We used to party all night
We used to hang out all night like it was all right
Hoping we all might make it through
Doin what it takes to do to keep it true

[Luther]
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
Cuz Sylvia's would burn all night

[1:]
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the Nights in Harlem
Remember the times that we would dance all night long
Remember the Nights in Harlem

Big sister had a group 
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drove them "B" girls wild

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

[Guru]
Hey, yo, the blocks are hot
Uptown you know the spots
Night life where this playa's game is quite tight
One two five where my name's inscribed
Sparkin' trees, avoiding felonies, keepin' it love
Headed for them riches, straight to stardom
Can't forget the struggle, all Brooklyn to Harlem
Dapper Dan's, shows at the Apollo
Harlem days, summertime is my rhyme ya follow
And through the pain, we held on
With more to obtain, more to gain 
Ya can't dwell on bad vibes and sad lives we encountered
Take care of self and family, that's what it amounts to
Inhale so you could feel this realness
In New York sound, down with more cats than Felix
Steal this?  Yeah, some they may wanna
You can't duplicate the great, I make it warmer
Just like the Harlem world streets we all knew
We coming up this time, we all flow, we all glow
Each one's gotta shing, a better life
That's what each one's gotta find

[Repeat 1 until fade]
