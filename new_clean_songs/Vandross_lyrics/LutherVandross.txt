// Take You Out //

Yeah, yeah
Here it is

She caught me by surprised I must say
Cause I never have seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fascinated, surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

[1] - Excuse me miss
But what's your name
Where are you from and can I come
And possibly, can I take you out tonight

To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and I'm going
I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

[Repeat 1 (2x)]

That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
Cause you're never gonna know 
Where you'll find love, oh yeah
And hopefully I found it in you, yeah

[Repeat 1 till end]

// Grown Thangs //

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah

What good is the money
When lately we've been missing each other
Cuz we've got work and kids, you know how it goes
Monday through Friday, 9 to 5
We spend most of the time chasing that dough

But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly
Call your momma, tell her come over
So we can have quality time
Cuz it's been too long since I held you in my arms
I can't wait no more, I'm ready to oooo

[1] - You make me wanna
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs
Do thangs with you

Tonight we gon' forget our worries
Put the kids to bed
I'm going out instead with you

Steppin' out with you
I'm steppin on out with you, darling

Girl put that "celly" down
Don't even peek at your pager now
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow
We're in a club full of people
But it feels just like me and you

My baby's looking hot tonight
Catching everybody's eye
Look at them starin', but I ain't carin'
Cuz I know you're mine
We should do this more often
Got a fella feelin' kinda flossy
I can't wait to make your body go ooh, ooh, ooh

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

(You know how it goes)
(Keep chasin' that dough)

I'll ring the bell like I used to do
Hold the door for you, let you through
Take your hand and talk to you
Make you know you're my star
I'm gonna woo ya (yeah yeah)
Say pretty words to ya (yeah yeah)
Send chills right through ya (oh yeah)
And remind you how loved you are

[Repeat 1 until fade]

// Bring Your Heart To Mine //

Why am I not surprised, I see it in your eyes
You're just not happy with your life
Running from guy to guy
Living another lie when you should be mine

I saw you on the block today 
Was gonna speak, but I walked away
Couldn't find a single thing to say 
Down the street the thought had still remained
Girl he must be insane 
How could he treat you that way, oh

Just cuz he wants to make love
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you
And I really hope you hear me this time
Maybe one day you'll wake up
Then you'll have to face up to the truth

I don't want to be a hater
But he really needs to raise up off you
And I hope you understand it tonight 
I don't care what it takes girl
There's too much at stake girl
No mountain's too high to climb 
To bring your heart to mine

Why do we play this game
Love can't be contained
I've got to make my move, oh yeah
I can feel the flames
Whenever you're close to me
I don't know what to do

I'll wait long as I can for you
Give all that I am for you
I know he's not the man for you
In my soul, I got plans for you
I'll be holding on (Yeah)
Cuz I know that he'll be gone, ooh

Just cuz he wants to make love
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you
And I really hope you hear me tonight
Maybe one day you'll wake up
Then you'll have to face up to the truth

I don't want to be a hater
But he really needs to raise up off you
Girl I really hope you hear me this time
I don't care what it takes girl
There's too much at stake girl
Just give me some kind of sign
And I'll bring your heart to mine

Girl, I know sometimes
That you feel like the sun don't shine
But if you look real deep inside
You'll realize you should be mine

Just cuz he wants to make love
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you
Won't you try to understand me tonight
Maybe one day you'll wake up
Then you'll have to face up to the truth

I don't want to be a hater
But he really needs to raise up off you
Girl, I swear that what I'm saying it right
I don't care what it takes girl
There's too much at stake girl
I'll come for you anytime
To bring your heart to mine

Just cuz he wants to make love
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you
I really hope you hear me tonight
Maybe one day you'll wake up
And give me your love
It's killing me but I'm trying
To bring your heart to mine

// Can Heaven Wait //

Quarter after seven, got a phone call
Telling me to get here quick
Said your girl is in a bad situation
They don't know if she's gonna make it

As I hurry to be by her side
I ask a thousand times, why oh why
There's no rhyme or reason in my life 
With you lying here this way

I'd give anything just to trade places with you
So I'm begging heaven down on my knees
To help you make it through

[1] - Tell me can heaven wait
Can heaven wait just one more night
Tell me what it's gonna take 
To keep you with me in my life

Giving up the shame of my other life
Now I'm seeing things in a whole new light
Lord, I vow to change if you just make it right
Can heaven wait one night

Thinking back on times that I've wasted
I should have cherished every day
All the different flavors that I tasted
Can't compare to you, no way

As I reminisce by your side
Tears of guilt are streaming from my eyes
All the things I did that weren't right
Wish I could apologize

I'd give anything if I could trade places with you
So I'm beggin' heaven down on my knees
To help you make it through

[Repeat 1]

I'm gonna stop the world, reverse the time
Do whatever it takes to keep you alive
Heaven has to wait one more day

Baby, take my breath so you can breathe
I need you here so don't you leave
Heaven has to wait

[Repeat 1 until fade]

// Say It Now //

I hope you hear this cuz I'm about to say it now

Guess I'm to blame and it's just a shame
Cuz I had the chance to tell you what you meant
But I lived my life thinking I had time
And that in my mind I'd get to it

Now you've gone away, not a single day goes by
When I don't think about it
Your spirit's all around, I can say it now
I hope you hear this

Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way
And it ain't the same
Cuz you never ever got to hear me say 
That I love you, cuz I waited too late
So oh, I've got to tell everybody
Don't make the same mistake

[1] - It's alright to say I love you out loud
And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside
Let it out, do it today
No no no, don't you wait 
Cuz it just might be too late
To say I love you

Don't walk a mile inside my shoes
Cuz if you do, you're gonna regret it
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be 
Here or there tomorrow

Why you wanna wait, communicate
Don't assume that they already know
How much, how much you're really feeling
And you really, really love them

Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way
And it ain't the same 
Cuz you never ever got to hear me say
That I love you, cuz I waited too late
It's like I would tell anybody
Don't make the same mistake like I did

[Repeat 1]

Those three words make all the difference in the world
You might wait and miss your chance
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling
You can't turn back the hands of time
If you get the chance, do it right 
Let it out, say it now
Say it

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

I'm ready 
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud
So ready 
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now
But I waited too late 
So today I won't make the same mistake, no
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

It's alright

// Hearts Get Broken All The Time (But The Problem Is, This Time It's Mine) //

So many times I've seen
So many people's dreams
Lost and washed away
Out to the sea, yeah

I said "No, not I"
Pain would surely pass me by
Happening to them, but not to me, yeah

Hearts get broken all the time
Never used to worry about things like this
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)
Now I'm worrying (This one is mine)
See the problem is the heart is mine

Love would be all I'd need
How naive could I be
Trusting other people with my care, yeah

Never thought I'd have to be
One of love's casualties
Up until now my belief was that love was fair

Hearts get broken all the time
But I never worried 'bout things like this
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)
I keep worrying (This one is mine)
See the problem is the heart is mine

This time my heart's breaking
This time my love's failing
I'm trying hard not to be bitter now

I never dreamed that the broken heart would be mine

Hearts get broken all the time
You think it's love, but it never really is
Never could imagine a thing like that (I wouldn't worry)
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)
Got me worrying (This one is mine)
See the problem is the heart is mine
This is mine, this is mine, yeah

Hearts get broken all the time
Never cared a doggone thing about that (I didn't worry)
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)
And the problem really is (This one is mine)
See the whole thing is the heart is mine

This time it's mine
This one is mine
The heart is mine

This time it's mine
This one is mine
The heart is mine

This time it's mine
This one is mine
The heart is mine

// How Do I Tell Her //

[1] - How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before
How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before

I'm doing all I can to try and understand
Why my feelings faded away
She's been nothin' but good to me
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free
I can't stay in this love
How do I say goodbye

[Repeat 1]

She pretends she can not see
The love is gone from me
She carries on as if it is what it was before
But I don't love her anymore
I have to let her know
That I must let her go
I can't stay in this life
How do I say goodbye

[Repeat 1]

Oh, I don't know what to do about it
Gotta tell her, gotta tell her, gotta tell her
Oh, there's no way to go around it
I've got to tell her now
But I don't know how

Listen, listen baby
Listen closely baby
I just gotta tell you
All the love we once had is through

Listen, listen baby
Listen closely baby
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I can't stay, I can't stay

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

// Any Day Now //

Any day, you'll be gone, oh yeah
Any day, you'll be gone

Any day now
I will hear you say goodbye my love
Then you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be alone
I know that, hey, I know that

Any day now
When the clock strikes go, you'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down
Cuz you won't be around
No baby now, yeah

I know I shouldn't wanna keep you
If you don't wanna stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way 
And I'm begging you to stay

Any day now
When your restless eyes meet someone new
And to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, I won't last for long
Cuz any day, you'll be gone
Then any day, you'll be gone
I know, I know that

You'll be gone, you'll be gone, you'll be gone
Yeah, mercy, any day now
Any day, you'll be gone
Mercy, yeah
Any day, you'll be gone

// If I Was The One //

I see the way he treats you
I feel the tears you cry
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad
There's nothin' I can do, baby
Cuz your lover is my best friend
And I guess that's where the story ends
So I've gotta try to keep it inside
You'll never be, never be mine

[1] - But if I was the one who was loving you, baby
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy
And if I was by your side
You'd never know one lonely night

If it was my arms you were running to
I'd give you love in these arms of mine
If I was the one in your life

If I could have just one wish
I'd wish that you were mine
I would hold you near, kiss away those tears
I'd be so good to you, baby
You're the one I want next to me
But I guess that's just not meant to be
He's there in your life, he's sharing your nights
I'll never be, never be, never be right

[Repeat 1]

I want to reach out and feel you beside me, beside me
Right here, right now, right beside me baby, baby
And take you in my arms right now
And scream I love you right out loud
And then someday I'll pray I'll find
I'll find the strength to turn to you and say

[Repeat 1]

If I was the one, if I was the one, the one 
If I was the one in your life

// Let's Make Tonight The Night //

Livin' day to day, the same old things 
Enough to make you want to scream
Limited time, border line
Peace of mind is all you need
But I know a place far away 
From all the noise and crowded streets
If ya jump in the car, it ain't that far 
The ride with me is free

[1] - Let it flow, let it go, let me get your coat
Baby let it be me
Let me open that door, let me get your seat
Show a little bit of chivalry
Let me kiss you right there
Smellin' your hair, let me hold your hand
Play some soul 
Baby let me know (I wanna be your man)

[2] - Let's make tonight the night
That we ride underneath the stars so high
Let's make tonight the night
That we fall in love if we think it's right
Let's make tonight the night
That we both decide what it's gonna be
Let's make tonight the night
That you fall in love with me finally

I remember when I used to sit 
And wish that it would rain
Knowin' the sun would come to stay
And chase the clouds away
Ya gotta know that somethin' beautiful
Is always on the way
And deep in your heart 
You feel the spark of love and everything's okay

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

Finally you'll say you love me
I betcha betcha you do
I betcha you do yeah

Finally tonight you're gonna be in love with me
Fall in love with me, yeah
Let's make tonight the night
Let's make tonight the night
Let's make tonight the night
Let's make tonight the night

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2 until fade]

// Like I'm Invisible //

You talk about me as if I'm not there
You don't even whisper cuz you just don't care
I stand there and listen to my life go by
And at times I wonder why I even try

Well I try because I like to finish what I start
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow
But it won't if you keep treating me
Like I'm invisible

[1] - Say that you won't treat me 
The way you're treating me
Say that you won't
I see you but you just keep looking right through me
Like someone you don't even see
Like I'm invisible

You brag to your friends how much I must want ya
You said I was someone you could do with or without
You're so confident that I'd never leave you
No wonder you're surprised that I am walking out

Well, I have to leave no matter how sad it might be
Because this hurt's become my reality
And I won't let you keep on treating me
Like I'm invisible

[Repeat 1]

Well I finally got the nerve to move on
Cuz a fly kind of guy like me 
Surely deserves more, much more
My new love can see what's inside of me
And she told me to thank you 
For the good love that you blew, and oh

I wish you could see the way she looks at me
She don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly
She don't hide me from her friends when we have company
And she never ever makes me feel
Like I'm invisible

And after we lay here, she wants me to stay here
I'm not just for making love then expected to leave
I'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet
And she'd never ever walk on by me
Like I'm invisible

Like I'm invisible

// Are You There (With Another Guy) //

I'm standing on your doorstep 
And I don't know what to do
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away
My friends all say that you were never true
I'm hiding in the shadows

I hear the music coming out of your radio
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I hear the laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another guy instead of me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, I would surely die
I'm hiding in the shadows

And I see two silhouettes in back of your window shade
Are you there with another guy when I am gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another guy, I can't go on, oh no
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you, worry so about you
Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith but
(I hear the music coming out of your radio)

I only know I love you, and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know 
If you should go, I would surely die
I'm hiding in the shadows

Yeah, (In the shadows)
Really plotting, hiding in the shadows
I'm hiding in the shadows, yeah

(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
Pity, pity
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
Umm pah pitty
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
Umm pah pah, pity pity
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)

I hear the music coming out of your radio
Are you there with another guy instead of me
Oh no, don't tell me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No I can't believe it
I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another guy instead of me
Please don't say (Yeah, yeah yeah)
(It's a pity)

I hear the music coming out of your radio
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)

No, I can't believe it
I hear the laughter and there's something I got to know
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)

Yeah baby
Without my love, I pity the girl
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
Your radio
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
Oh yeah, yeah
Umm pah pah, pity the girl
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)

// Love Forgot //

Learn to love and you learn to survive
My mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me
It was the story of my life
I awakened seeing with new eyes
I begged forgiveness, but love wouldn't hear me
Taught you to fear me, baby

Love forgot we used to be just fine
And love forgot about the tender times
Love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me
Give me one more try
Maybe love forgot this time

Love can't love someone who breaks a vow
But I was not myself, my heart wasn't in it
I still loved you every minute
I could fix it if you show me how
You didn't hear it from somebody else, I told you
Praying you'd let me hold you

(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way
Our poetry will ever rhyme
I think love forgot this time

But who would have ever known
I'd ever be tempted, but I'm hopin'
Love will show me what to do
Cuz if it was all so easy
Then anybody else coulda shown me
I don't understand how you wouldn't know
I never even meant it

(I can't believe) Did love forget this was the only time
(Impossible) Did love forget I tried to set things right
(It couldn't be) Did love forget to remember
That regret lives in this heart of mine
Maybe love forgot this time

(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way
That poetry will ever rhyme
Maybe love forgot this time

Did you forget this time
Did you forget this time
Don't forget me now
Don't forget me now
Did you forget somehow
Did you forget somehow
