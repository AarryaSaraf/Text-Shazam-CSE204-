// Cherry-Coloured Funk //

Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else
You steam a lens stable eyes and glass 
Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news
Still we can find our love down from behind
Down far behind this fabulous, my turn rules

Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and then blued
Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else

You steam a lens stable eyes and glass
Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news
You'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night
We hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasty

Still being cried and laughed at before
Should I be sewn in hugged I can by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from light to blue
And should I be hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque

And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
You mind not saying
He'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night

Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
We hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains
Hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for key

// Pitch The Baby //

I'm so happy to care for you
I only want to love you and
Slip me home as we seal us in
You and that land which one dresh are leaving
Hold me onto a mess a plenty
Me and that land should grow, end to a hard part
Meant a Christmas that's me and a friend
I only want to love you
I only want to love you
I only want to love you
I only want to love you

I'm so happy to care for you,
I only want to love you

I'm so happy to care for you,
I only want to love you

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension(inside you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension(inside you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension
(I only want to love you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension
(I only want to love you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

// Iceblink Luck //

I'm seeming to be glad a lot
I'm happy again, caught, caught in time
Expose the doubt and arm yourself well
Me, I defend with sober heart

You're the maraschino cherry coal (the match of Jerico)?
That will burn this whole madhouse down
And will not throw open like a walnut safe
More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff, yes

You, yourself, and your father
Don't know so much in your own ways
You're really both bone-setters
Thank you for mending me, babies

You're the maraschino cherry coal (the match of Jerico)?
That will burn this whole madhouse down
And I'll throw open like a walnut safe
You will seem more like being
That same bottle of exquisite stuff
Yes, you are the maraschino cherry coal (the match of Jerico)?
That will burn this old madhouse down
And I'll throw open like the walnut safe

You, yourself, and your father
Don't know so much in your own ways
You're really both bone-setters
Thank you for mending me, babies

// Fifty-Fifty Clown //

I feel rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a lone shadow
I feel rewarded on being so ugly, eh

I feel rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a lone shadow
I feel rewarded on being so ugly, eh

Smile and face your wife angry
His life don't despise what's in eyes
He skips so as the seasons
To come as a breeze has
Again, ahead

We'll rust, our nose dust
A fine gard with pleased and, oh its true
Hill can't comfort the brain
He must come as he was
Again, ahead

And this is safe, flowing, love, soul and light
Motions aren't in the shape that emotions are
Good morning myth to somebody I call in light
Motions aren't in the shape that emotions are
And this is safe, flowing, love, soul and light
Motions aren't in the shape that emotions are

// Heaven Or Las Vegas //

Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
It's a role, he'll never make a suit
Hang on to this
So stay and spin and fail and fail
Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Furthermore, let's blast it off
I'm dizzy so I go under the Big Dipper
Come fantasy for a carnival
I'm empty before our wedding

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Maybe there, while you was rail
I'll go in and seize your heart and be personal
I suspect I'm singing to you a tune
And still you find the beat and sing it to you soon

// I Wear Your Ring //

You don't feel damned between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Please them or run on the turf

You could be raising money with your momma
You might be showing you're round 
And dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone

Men are so nice
Lays can be
Roses may fly
Men are so useful
He's a flirt
Men are so useful
Reflection beauty
Men are so nice
He pleases me fine
Reflection beauty
Men are so useful

Be able to feel
Don't feel damned between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Please them or run on the turf

You could be
You could be raising money with your momma
You could be
You might be showing you're round 
And dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone

Men are so nice
Lays can be
He pleases me fine
Men are so useful
He's a flirt
Men are so useful
Reflection beauty
Men are so nice
He pleases me fine
Reflection beauty
Men are so useful

Beautiful hands us no way lies a means of love
Men are so nice
On sounds and guard the stone, and bed had a law
He pleases me fine
Answers written and I reason
He pleases me fine
In the reign of sex, blown more than it's pleased to be
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
He's a beauty affection, oooh
He's a beauty affection, oooh
He's a beauty affection, oooh

// Fotzepolitic //

My dreams are low, they're sick and must be addressed
They're young girl's dreams.

True some do it and shoot
Like the penny-lit stars
What I was just rude

Like the scary hairs on our singing hoof
Like the scary hairs on our singing hooves
They move

A family fool, but it's you,
I can swoon inside me
Then you'll accept my things

A coloured star, but I feel strong
Luck when bound lonely to Lars
When I'm empty headed

See 'n saw bounce me back to you' 
Will you?
See 'n saw bounce me back to you' 
Will you' Oh will you?

My dreams are low, they're sick and must be addressed
They're young girl's dreams.

See 'n saw bounce me back to you' 
Will you?
See 'n saw bounce me back to you' 
Will you' Oh will you?

See 'n saw bounce me back to you
See 'n saw bounce me back to you
See 'n saw bounce me back to you
Will you?

See 'n saw bounce me back to you
See 'n saw bounce me back to you
See 'n saw bounce me back to you
Will you?

// Wolf In The Breast //

Under my shirt, Have to amass
Sling the tainted words
I'm each arms they fall on
It's my body, Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow, it might survive

My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed, I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when our love-angel unleashed that day
It's my body, Puzzles the trick in me
I lend it out to borrow, it might survive

My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when our love-angel unleashed that day
I'll feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual

True blue and real
I feel, I feel
True blue and real
Laughing on my bed
I've pretended I knew the way
Especially when our love-angel unleashed that day
I'll feel perpetual, I feel perpetual
I'll feel perpetual
True and real

// Road River And Rail //

He'll be flied away
From those choices that they took
Naked and caught on the Isle de la Cite
Roll of home may be
There's over eleven since she's been
For machine and a feeling I still care
Faulting to mention forms in flight
Fabulous in dream of eve
Flaying on the ground and your infant lives

From out of the bayous
Seen the way is corporeal
The little pants into nowheres
Through Paris breaks soul
From out of the bayous

From must have beige
So we didn't while we seized
Until the fog made me run through that hectic glare
Love won't be forged
And was a fog, was them that cherished

Road, river and rail
"So embarrased, I'm not sure at all", 
Lies mother's daughter
Truth is she found love

Road, river and rail

// Frou-Frou Foxes In Midsummer Fires //

I buckle and rosed 
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war or we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions(indications)
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby
In day
And night to come

I buckle and rosed 
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war or we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions(indications)
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby
In day
And night to come

Their little hands
Smooth all things
Ad nauseum

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-colored
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-colored
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder
Pulled rounder

Pulled round
Trousers
Tighter
Tighter

Their fan I tickle
From serpents to dragons
I'd immerse you in flame
Your milk and your passion
Lead weight for his from his old turn
The young, I was eagerest
I'm losing the stars
I enlisted to find you
I buckle and rosed 
As god and the rest(wrist)
How mere riches be
A war all we lose
Close into symbols
A fly drinks the ignitions
They turn infant's breath my
Milk and wrap to her baby

In day
And night to come
Their little hands
Smooth all things
Ad nauseum

Things old
And young
Very young
Rise here comes our reason
of the stars I enlisted to find you

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening
(Pulled round)
Eyes on the usually science of cherry-coloursed
(Trousers)
Limelight not the music, it's plain as as can be so
(Tighter)
All of the time I improvise by making sure
(Tighter)
It's to wait for you
Pulled round of 
Pulled round of 
Pulled round of 
Pulled round of 

Singed by it, pulled around of my blazening

Eyes on the usually science of cherry-coloursed

Limelight not the music, it's plain as as can be so

All of the time I improvise by making sure
