// Orange Appled //

Wait and see who'll wake up then
Always stars see what, once you're free 
He hopes will be the very last time

He loves you more than this
The stars let you know all's right and bright and
He loves you more than this
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

Wait and see who'll wake up then
Always stars see what, once you're free
He hopes will be the very last time

He loves you more than this
The stars let you know all's right and bright and
He loves you more than this
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained

With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay
With a yell to you, he yawed, he'd stay

What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained
What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained
What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained
What, once you're free, he hopes will be the very last time
Ego lets him know that's how much more was gained...

// Love's Easy Tears //

Love, without him
She ought to know he owns himself
Love, without him
She ought to know

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that he lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them

Love, without him
She ought to know he owns himself
Love, without him
She ought to know

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that he lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them

Joys of love had the cat on the couch these days
Don't go leave me out
Every stuffy day I go home
Plus you don't know love

Gee, how many loved her man
How he could have done that?
He lived so loved
The phone rang
Die, so long, so love
Yea, man, joys of love said them
(Please, please, please)

// Those Eyes That Mouth //

Let me, let me, tell more mouth
Bold eyes 
Oh no no no don't don't don't

Will they let me tell more mouth
Bold eyes
Oh no no don't don't don't don't

Yes I'm in love
Yes I'm in love
And afraid to see you
Til the next one
Yes I'm in love
Yes I'm in love
And afraid to see you
Your wrath

Do we deny then
Worth we have yet had chorus
Desperate gender
No
Are we united
worth we have yet had
Desperate angel 
No

Are we agreed
Now we are free
To the feelings we should have
They've all gone dancing
Now we agree
Now we are we
And the feelings we should have
They've all gone dancing

Will they let me tell more mouth
Bold eyes
Oh no no don't don't don't don't

Feels
Now we are angels
Excellent deal
Soon all of it falls

Feels
Now we are angels
Excellent deal
Soon all of it falls

// Sigh's Smell Of Farewell //

In all my fantasies

So many fly above my head
I sighed see angry

So many fly above his head
He says, we always have these stars
Some street they're in
My street street, now sold
My street street, now mine
Street street, now
Street street

So many fly above my sighs
He sighs, we always have these stars
Some street, my human part is
So many fly above your head
I sighed, see them, be them
He sighed, such things are human

So many fly above my head
I sense the angry part
He sighed, such things they leave their pits

Pick my feet up proudly, said he,
I have sighed, Less of these
Lonesome youngest, lonely, just a plea
Pick my feet up proudly, said he,
I have sighed
I have sighed, sighed, sighed
He said, he said, he said
