Album: LaughingOnTheOutside

// For All We Know //

Sweetheart, the night is growing old
Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment, uh, sweet again
We won't say goodnight, not until the last, the very last minute
I'll hold out my hand and nothing but my heart will be in it

For all, for all we know this may only be a sweet dream
But we come and we've got to go, just like the ripples on a stream
Oh, love me, love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some
But for us tomorrow may, may never come, for all we know

// Make Someone Happy //

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

Fame if you win it
Oh, it comes and it goes in a minute
Now, where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to really love is the answer
And once you've found him
Keep trying to build your world around him

Oh, make someone, someone happy
Make just one, one someone happy
And I guarantee you will be happy too

Ooooh, make someone, someone happy
Oh, sometime in live you ought to try make someone happy
And you will be happy too

// Solitude //

In my solitude
You haunt me
With memories
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
There's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I pray
Dear Lord above
Please send back my love

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one, no one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
Oh, there's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon, I'll soon go mad

Oh, in my solitude
I pray
Oh, dear Lord, dear Lord above
Send back my love

// Laughing On The Outside //

The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Oh, I'm happy with my someone new
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Oh, I'm having such a gay time
But they don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
Oh, but the tears are in my heart

So darling, can't we make up?
Ever, ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I'm still laughing on the outside
But everyday I'm crying on the inside
Because I'm still, still in love with you

// Say It Isn't So //

Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Everyone is saying that you don't love me
Say it isn't so

Everywhere I go, everyone I know
Whispers you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so

People say that you, you found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it, say it, say it, say it isn't true

Tell me everything is still okay
That's all I need to know and what they're saying
Say it isn't so

Say that everything is still okay, yeah, yeah
That's all I need to know, if you just say it to me
Please say it isn't so

// Until The Real Thing Comes Along //

I'd work for you, slave for you
I'd even be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly, I'd gladly, I'd gladly move the earth for you
Oh, just to prove my love and it's worth for you
Now, if that isn't love it'll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't sing to make you understand
I'll always love you darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?

I'd sigh, I'd sigh for you, I'd even cry for you
I'd reach out and even tear the stars out of the skies for you
Now if that isn't love it'll just have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along

// Where Are You? //

Where, where are you?
Where have you gone without me?
I thought you cared about me
Where, where are you?

Where's my heart?
Where is the dream we started?
Oh, I just can't believe that we're parted
Where, where are you?

When we said goodbye love, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

All life through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is, where is my happy ending?
Where, where are you?

When we said goodbye love, was it just, was it just a game?
And when I gave you my love, was it all in vain?

All night through
Must I go on pretending?
Where is, where is my happy, happy ending?
Where, oh, where, oh, where, honey where are you?

// Mr. Ugly //

Haunt my house Mr. Ugly
I know how beautiful you are
When you hold me tight
Rainbow spill the night
Tell me, are you my lucky star?

Play your guitar, my Mr. Ugly
Your melodies are so divine
Winter is spring to me
When you sing to me
You serenade this heart of mine

You don't scare me, just to look at you
I'd crawl across the great divide
Although you're small
To me you're so tall
When you kiss me my heart's open wide, oh, wide

Oh, don't make me cry, my Mr. Ugly
Cling to me, never, never, ever let me go
Make my live complete
Dance me off my feet
Tell me the things I need to know
Mr. Ugly you're, you're not ugly to me anymore

// I Wanna Be Around //

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Oh, but who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, oh, wait and see

And I do mean, I wanna be around to see how she does it
When she breaks your heart to bits
Now let's see how the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is so sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Oh, yeah, like you, oh, like you broke mine, yeah
