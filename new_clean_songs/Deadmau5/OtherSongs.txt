// Afterhours //

I see you sitting at the bar
I wonder who the fuck you are
You undress me with your eyes
Dreaming of my creamy thighs

Did you wanna see my tits?
Do you wanna taste my lips?
Take me now I'm feeling hot
Right now, right here on the spot

Throw me down, on the bar
Shall we do the it in the car?
You're so naughty, I'm so nice
Maybe we should do it twice

I don't even know your name
You don't need to know my game
I know you wanna hear those screams
'cause you're the one that's in my dreams

I see you sitting at the bar
I wonder who the fuck you are
You undress me with your eyes
Dreaming of my creamy thighs

Did you wanna see my tits?
Do you wanna taste my lips?
Take me now I'm feeling hot
Right now, right here on the spot

Throw me down, on the bar
Shall we do the it in the car?
You're so naughty, I'm so nice
Maybe we should do it twice

I don't even know your name
You don't need to know my game
I know you wanna hear those screams
'cause you're the one that's in my dreams

// Are You Not Afraid? //

Somebody fill my cup while I keep this reefer burnin'
Come fuck my mood up, I hope you do need to speak on somethin'
You can sleep on me but your deathbed is the sheets and covers
I mean if you beef then the repercussion's the reaper's caution
Fuck 'em, tell your favorites I'm a league above 'em
I put that on every piece of pussy that my penis bust in
Lord, I think I can hear them demons call me
Christ, they're tryna cross me like the Jesus somethin'
That's a super bad look, rappers seem to be McLovin
Sayin' Horroh's weak and then ask for a fucking feature from him
I fuck your bitch when I see your woman
If she doesn't know me, I'll tell her I'm Justin Bieber's cousin

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?

They could never call me ordinary
What? Fuck 'em, with one foot in the mortuary
They said that hip-hop's dead, I hit them all to get it
Put it on my back and I don't even think the corpse is heavy
Tell them stupid cartoon rappers Tutankhamun's back
I'm 2Pac with his juice back
A zoot wrap, two straps, a Hail Mary two track
Bitch, I'll kill us all if you don't move back
Kamikaze, I find it hard giving half a shit
Narcissist, I guarantee I've got a larger dick
This fucking groupie tried to send me to the bar for drinks
I told that thirsty bitch, "Here's a yard of piss you could hardly lift"
Bob Marley spliff will put me where the martians live
I use a couple bloodclaat yaadis as my pharmacist

What might happen?

Bitches like kick flips (Yay), all up on my gnarly tricks
And they just wanna blow me like some broken Sega cartridges
I led my hyenas to the deer's blood
Not a strong enough for bringing me a werewolf
I've got a big old gang to get it cleared up
Trip and lead your sisters to leaking liquid from tear ducts
Keep on giving that weird look, you'll get hit with this beer cup
Bully bitch stomp her head, if you're full of shit, you appear tough
You're nothing here to our motherfuckers in here
Don't suck a dick, you come near, you'll get fuckin' kicked in your beer gut
Victims in fear when I put a couple whispers in ears
Man, enough fuckin' kittens in here, tell them pussy whiskers get sheared up
Mother, cousins, and peers but they not heard from you for years
'Cause we get cut and chopped, then we clear up
Bloods, innards, and smeared guts
Sufferin' succotash
Took an upper-class slut mother back to fuck her while her son was in a rugby match
You in the club, turnin' up, doing the dougie dance
I'm at your crib, choking a bitch with her underpants

Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?
Are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?

// Blood For The Bloodgoat //

I know you'll look the other way
I-I-I-I, know you long for something new
So there you're wasting all your day
looking for something that was right in front of you
And I-I-I-I, just want them to notice you
And I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you

There's something flying in the air
And I-I-I-I, just don't know what it could be
Smoke is flying everywhere
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me
And I-I-I-I, I know that we might be through
But I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you.

I know you'll look the other way
I-I-I-I, know you long for something new
So there you're wasting all your day
looking for something that was right in front of you
And I-I-I-I, just want them to notice you
And I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you

There's something flying in the air
And I-I-I-I, just don't know what it could be
Smoke is flying everywhere
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me
And I-I-I-I, I know that we might be through
But I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you.

// Bridged By A Lightwave //

If I flew to Japan
And stood beside the waves with you
And danced across your face
Would we forget that we were strangers?
If I was there to take it in
And walk between the change in spaces
Dance through light in altered places
Would a fire begin?

Gone on a fast train
Oceans of blank space
High on an airplane
Bridged by a lightwave

If I went back in time
Removed the boulders that still chase us
Would we still let lust create us
Or would we start to climb?
If our dimensions were the same
If I could touch you in the flesh
Fold the time and space between us
Would yours fall into mine?

Shadows on our stage
Here from another phase
Nothin' in our way
All but a 3D place
All but a 3D place
All but a 3D place
Bridged by a lightwave

If I flew to Japan
And stood beside the waves with you
And danced across your face
Would we forget that we were strangers?
If I was there to take it in
And walk between the change in spaces
Dance through light in altered places
Would a fire begin?

Gone on a fast train
Oceans of blank space
High on an airplane
Bridged by a lightwave
All but a 3D place

If I flew to Japan
And stood beside the waves with you
And danced across your face
Would we forget that we were strangers?
If I was there to take it in
And walk between the change in spaces
Dance through light in altered places
Would a fire begin?
Gone on a fast train
Oceans of blank space
High on an airplane
Bridged by a lightwave

// Ghosts 'N' Stuff //

It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
She took me to a place where my senses gave way
Turn it 'round, shut it down, what the people say
Climbing up, killing time, let 'em give you some
Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it

Take it back when she knows that you're doing it right
'Cause everybody else knows what they're taking tonight

But I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight

It's been so far, I've been walking the line on my own
Lift me up to the stars, we are coming home
I only had a taste but we're out of time
We have sold in the cold, physical design
Set me free, set me out on the run
Lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the

We are burning down, we are burning down
It's the way that you fake it, I know it's too late

But I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight

I just wanna take you down
We are gonna bring you 'round

I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight

I just wanna take you down
We are gonna bring you 'round

// Ghosts 'N' Stuff (Nero Remix) //

It's been so long I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true [3x]

But I just want to play it right
We are gonna get there tonight

It's been so long I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true [2x]

// Hi Friend! //

Are you receiving?
Can you feel me?

The information
That you're seeking
A sensation that is sneaking
Has you reaching
For the ceiling
Theres no fighting

This reciting is inviting

All systems go out on the floor
This is what you came here for

Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!

Now your mind is open
Your thoughts are flying
To the bounce thats amplifying
Taking form
As you're complying
Grab the notion
Carry on replying
Adopt tension
Embrace mention
True ascension
Feeds retention

All systems go out on the floor
This is what you came here for

Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!

// I Remember //

Feeling the past moving in
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
You don't have to move on to let go

Add to the memory you keep
Remember when you fall asleep
Hold to the love that you know
You don't have to give up to let go

Remember turning on the night
And moving through the morning light
Remember how it was with you
Remember how you pulled me through

I remember

[Shotty Horroh:]
Fuck drugs I guess they don't work
Tattoo'd body I don't need no shirt
Probably need Jesus but I don't go church
I'm on this hotel floor tryna soul search
Pop a couple more they won't hurt
My mind or my body which one'll go first?
Keep your weed I don't smoke dirt!
Mine'll put you on your back like Goldberg
Yes! Yes! Rock n' roll brother
Got a face that was made for the Rolling Stone cover
Gettin' money like a coke pusher
My pocket's lookin' like a skinny T-shirt on bonecrusher
On the road like roadrunner
Wait the food and it look like her phone number
She saw the pucka and then asked me if I would roll for her
Want a hit of this feels like a stone cold stunner!

Legendary

[Shotty Horroh:]
Eh
Lexa pro's and a coffee cup
Runnin' through the city like Forrest Gump
Tried to give her draws and a proper skunk
But she prefers the white's like Donald Trump
Wish somebody would start poppin' up
So I could put them on ice like a hockey puck
Rap God I catch a body like [?] would
You against Shotty's like Rocky boxing with Tommy Gunn
What the fuck!?
Everybody turned Hollywood
@ symbol, hashtag please follow us
Snapchat filters doing what a doctor would
Instagram bitches editting their body up
Fuck em!
Biggest balls in the universe
Rumoured you can see my nuts using Google Earth
Rappers coming for me I ain't too concerned
I tell the very best one of em' come and do your worst

It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
You take me to a place where my senses gave way
Turn it round, shut it down, what the people say
Climbing up, coming down, gonna make a call
Take my hand and leave it all, leave it all, leave it all

And then these arts torn apart when they turned black and blue
'Cause everybody knows I've been waiting for you

Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
With you

// My Heart Has Teeth //

You've never met someone like me
My heart has teeth, my heart has teeth
And it's looking for something to eat
My heart has teeth, my heart has teeth
Oh, isn't it so bittersweet
That I love to watch you bleed?
You've never met someone like me
My heart has—, my heart has—
Because my heart has teeth

You've never met someone like me
My heart has teeth, my heart has teeth
And it's looking for something to eat
My heart has teeth, my heart has teeth

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me
Sparkle for me

It's shining like three seeds of pomegranates in my hands
It's just us that's on this beach and all this sand
All of this water
I know but damn
I know we ain't supposed to touch it
We only live once ma'am (Sparkle for me)
You said give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Then said take it, take it, take it
I said did we do this really?
Shouldn't we have waited? Waited?
You're making faces, probably so am I
We're in the ocean
Waves are rolling in your eyes

Pulse is high, the heartbeats
We're being called to the other side, girl
Lost in the vibe, we can't sleep
Our clothes off
Feels so good inside, girl
(Sparkle for me)

It's been oh, so long
Since we've been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)
It's been oh, so long
Since we've been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)

What's the reason why we should do this tonight?
Spend the night, spend the night
Spend the night, spend the night (Sparkle for me)
So much you won't see without open eyes
'Cause closed eyes, is closed sight
And closed mind, is closed vibe (Sparkle for me)
Yeah, ew feelings it's bringing in
What's this tone I'm singing in? (Sparkle for me)
Your eyes are twinkling
My limbs are tingling (Sparkle for me)
You are a synonym
You're my best friend in the world (Sparkle for me)
All this adrenaline (Yeah, yeah)
Melting like M&M's

Pulse is high, the heartbeats
We're being called to the other side, girl
Lost in the vibe, we can't sleep
Our clothes off
Feels so good inside, girl

It's been oh, so long
Since we've been away from home (Sparkle for me)
All the fucks every last one gone
Blissfully, knowing this shit wrong (Sparkle for me)
It's been oh, so long

// Porcelain //

Our motions how they storm together, just to drive back into place.
The wind so cold, the crisp dark weather, was sent to end time or space.
Believe in there's another winters, daytime eats your night.
So why do we sing songs together?
Till they turnnnn off the light.
Our moment lost in oceans, maybe, like a strung out porcelain baby.
It seems so soon, that we'll be at the edge of the moon.
I know there's nothing now or never, every moment's time forever.
It seems so soon, that we'll be at the edge of the moon, (edge of the moon, edge of the moon).

// Satellite //

Sunday Rain
On my Parade
Wash Away
Washed me away

Cause we've been running our time
Feel like a satellite
Hosted in outer space

We build it up
To fall apart
And see the End
Before it starts
Oooohhh baby its cold in here
I'm chasing you down in a trail of tears
Into your high place

// Stay (Drop The Poptart) //

Breathe it in now, then breathe it out
Let the air flow over me
Up high, can you tell me what you see?
This life, is it more than just a dream?
Look at me now, then look away
Can you tell me what to do?
Your eyes, they no longer speak for you
Inside, tell me where you hide the truth

Inside, tell me where you hide the truth

If you want me to stay
I need you to know
You can never, ever leave me alone
If you want me to stay
I need you to know
I can't
I can never let you go

I can never let you go

// The Veldt //

Happy life with the machines scattered around the room
Look what they made; they made it for me... happy technology
Outside the Lions roam feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us now
So in love with the way we are here

The world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Every night they rock us to sleep, digital family
Is it real? Or is it a dream? Can you believe in machines?
Outside, the beating sun, can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave, look at us now
So in love with the way we are here

The world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Happy life... with the machines scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me; happy technology
Outside the lions roam feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us now
So in love with the way we are here

The world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

// When The Summer Dies //

I see the colors change when I look at the sky
They tell me life is too short to listen to the lies
Riding a plastic waterfall, I tell myself I
Won't feel a thing when the summer dies

Hey there, can you follow me?
Love is all you need
Nothing really matters if you never believe
Hey there, can you feel me now?
Baby, close your eyes
If you like this feeling let that black smoke rise

Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise

So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along

Black smoke
Black smoke
Black smoke

Nobody got nothing on the creative curse
Stuck on a thousand ideas and only one that works
What I first thought would be bad or worse
Singing our song in our blacked-out hearse

Ooh, these little friends got me feeling alright
Take me higher at night
Ooh, these violent ends, baby, cross my eyes
Let the black smoke rise

Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise

WHAT THE FUCK

(I can't read it, there's no--there's no words on it. There's no words there!
"To play us out." What does that mean, "to play us out?" I don't know what that means,
"to play us out," what does that mean?... I can't do it. We'll do it live.
WE'LL DO IT LIVE, FUCK IT! DO IT LIVE! I'LL WRITE IT, AND WE'LL DO IT LIVE! FUCKIN' THING SUCKS!)

What-what, what-what, what-what, what-what, what-what, what-what the fuu-- [x8]
