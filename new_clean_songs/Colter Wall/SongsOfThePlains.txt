// Plain To See Plainsman //

I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home

Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home

I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home

// Saskatchewan In 1881 //

Mr. Toronto man, go away from my door
You've got my wheat and canola seed, you're askin' me for more
Better fly 'fore I produce my .44

I'm just a prairie boy, never meant none no harm
Spent my days makin' wages out on the Martin's farm
No eastern boys are gonna twist my arm

It's so damn cold out here, the wind'll cut you half in two
I ain't kiddin' now, my old plow is frozen to my mule
I've been livin' off of ice-cold rainbow stew

Don't be pickin' fights with no Mennonites
Don't be raisin' cane while they're plantin' grain and workin' through the night
Gonna let you know if you ain't actin' right

Mr. Toronto man, go away from my door
You've got my wheat and canola seed, you're askin' me for more
Better fly 'fore I produce my .44
Better fly 'fore I produce my .44

// John Beyers (Camaro Song) //

John Beyers blew three holes in my ride
He put two in the tires and one in the side
Side panel of my 1969
Camaro, and so it's John I must find

So I hopped in Pop's pick-up and cranked up the heat
Got a clean .22 and some shells in the seat
And I lit up the dark and I shifted her down
This southside Swift Current boy's northside-bound

John Beyers just bought him a whole mess of pain
He's a fool if he thinks he can do this again
'Cause I'm crossin' that track just as soon as this train
Pulls out of the rail yard, ol' John's gonna pay

// Wild Dogs //

Once I was a wild dog
On the trail to a kill to feed my existence
That's where I first picked up the scent to her
Wanted her for my own after the kill
The stag was ours, together we brought it down
And it was the first blood that we tasted together

We were wild dogs
Wild dogs
Wild dogs

We'd roll amongst the sweet grass lickin' on each other
As the night replaced the day we'd bay and howl at the moon
We'd lay down and we'd listen to the silence of the stars
Shootin' 'cross the universe for us to see, her and me

We were wild dogs
Wild dogs
Wild dogs

We'd go runnin' through the forest with the grace of an eagle
With the freedom of the wind and the strength of our youth
Just like our old friend the Indian, we'd only kill to feed ourselves
Or to protect those we loved from danger

We were wild dogs
Wild dogs
We were wild dogs

// Calgary Round-Up //

We're headed for the round-up, goin' to the big stampede
Old Dick Cosgrove's ridin' in the lead
Hear the rattlin' chuck wagon and the snortin' buckin' broncs
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede

Gather 'round the old chuck wagon, fix you up some grub
Flip those flapjacks over in the pan
Old Jim Ross, the cook he, boys he sure can toss 'em up
Well his chuck is good enough for any man

We're a jolly bunch of cowboys and we hope you are the same
We have no cares, the laws we seldom heed
Come gather in our circle and we'll sing this round-up song
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede

The guy who rode Old Steamboat, Jack Manley was his name
A better pal a cowpunch never knew
The way that hoss could toss a rope and take the lead in hand
When you're stuck he'd always see you through

We're a jolly bunch of cowboys and we hope you are the same
We have no cares, the laws we seldom heed
Come gather in our circle and we'll sing this round-up song
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede
Yes we're headin' for the Calgary Stampede

// Night Herding Song //

Oh say, little dogies, why don't you lay down?
You've wandered and trampled all over the ground
Lay down, little dogies, lay down

I've cross-herded, circle-herded, trail-herded too
But to keep you together, that's what I can't do
Bunch up, little dogies, bunch up

My horse is leg-weary and I'm awful tired
But if I let you get away I'm sure to get fired
Bunch up, little dogies, bunch up

// Wild Bill Hickok //

Wild Bill was born in Illinois on dry and fertile land
Pioneer of pistol ears and a dead shot with each hand
Claim he was the quickest, there's few who'd ill-agree
If you were yet to saw this plainsman draw, still breathe like you and me

He led a stagecoach freight team in his early days of life
One evenin' on the Western Trail, Bill took the air of night
And who should come upon him, but a bear whom he'd awoke
Wild Bill produced his bowie knife and fashioned a new coat

Kansas prairies he knew well and wild Missouri too
Come 1861, Bill donned the Union blue
Not unlike his daddy, he'd seen old man in bonds
Every man in Jimmy Lane's brigade, of Hickok they were fond

While a marshal in Abilene many Texans came to call
Phil Coe told John Wes Hardin, "Wild Bill has got to fall
"He's a cruel and brutish yankee, and if you don't then I will"
Wild Bill put down Phil Coe, Wes Hardin's livin' still

He met his fate in Deadwood inside Tom Nuttall's place
Amidst a game of poker, holdin' Aces and two Eights
When up stepped from behind him the Coward, Jack McCall
The slug ripped through his auburn hair, poor Wild Bill never saw

// The Trains Are Gone //

The trains are gone, the trains are gone
Spent like the coal they once rolled on
The rails don't hum, the bows don't [?]
No brake-men yodelin' those rail yard songs

Granddad's ranch dried up fast
Ol' Johnny Chisum, he's seen to that
He's seen to that, matter of fact
Just as sure as Billy-boy got slain by Pat

I know I'm young, I know I'm young
I've seen too few a settin' sun
But the more I run the changes come
Swift as a freight train, the kind that's gone

The trains are gone, the trains are gone
Spent like the coal they once rolled on

// Thinkin' On A Woman //

Sweetly takin' his time
Drinkin' on a straight rye
Chasin' it with red wine
Heavy on his troubled mind
Sweetly takin' his time
Tryin' to make it all right
Thinkin' on that woman
Thinkin' on that woman

He's tunin' up the CB
"Can anybody hear me?"
"'Cause I'm headin' down the Number 3
"I got deadlines to meet"
Tunin' up his CB
Hopin' it will free me
Thinkin' on a woman
Thinkin' on that woman

He's been singin' sad songs
Thinkin' how she's long gone
He's treatin' those that love him wrong
He's ornery as the night is long
He's been singin' sad songs
Thinkin' how she's long gone
Thinkin' on that woman
Thinkin' on that woman

Burnin' up the midnight oil
Special brand of big-rig toil
It's enough to make your blood boil
These mountain roads'll prove my foil
Burnin' up the midnight oil
Gonna shuffle off this mortal coil
Thinkin' on a woman
Thinkin' on a woman

// Manitoba Man //

I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score
There's a Manitoba man behind the fillin' station store
Man, he's got stuff that leaves every limb singin' for more
So I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score

My good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life
But if I am to be truthful, I don't feel alive 'til it's night
When the hours I'm alone in the dark are the only in sight
But my good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life

But my time is past due and I ought to be movin' along
I've been kickin' my feet, wanderin' these streets for too long
My good gal, she tells me she's dreamin' of raisin' a son
But my time is past due, I ought to be movin' along

I reckon I'll make one last stop before I go
He's waitin' for me at the pumps, surely he knows
That twenty-four hours have passed since I last powdered my nose
So I reckon I'll make one last stop before I go

// Tying Knots In The Devil's Tail //

Well, it was way high up in the Sierry Petes
Where the yellow pines grow tall
Rusty Diggs and Sandy Sam
Had a round-up camp last fall
They had their ponies and their running irons
And maybe a dog or two
And they 'lowed they'd brand every lop-eared calf
That came within their view

Well many a lop-eared dogie
If he didn't hush up by day
Had his long ears whittled and his old hide scorched
In a most artistic way
Then says Rusty Diggs to Sandy Sam
As he throwed his seago down
"I'm tired of cowbiography
"And I figures I'll go to town"

They starts her in at the Kentucky Bar
At the head of the Whisky Row
And they ends her up at the Depot House
And forty drinks below
Then he winds her up and they turns her 'round
And they goes her the other way
Tell you the Lord-forsaken truth
Them boys got drunk that day

Well, they was a-headin' back to camp
And a-packin' a mighty good load
Who should they meet but the Devil himself
Come prancin' down the road?
And the Devil he said, "You cowboy skunks
"You better go hunt your hole
"'Cause I've come up from the Hell's rim rock
"To gather in your souls"
Says Rusty Jiggs to the Devil
"Though I know we're tight
"No devil ever took no cowpunch
"Without one kind of a fight"

So Rusty Jiggs punched a hole in his rope
He swang it straight and true
He lassoed it onto the devil's horns
And he's takin' his dallies true
Now Sandy Sam was a reata man
With his gut line coiled up neat
So he shakes her out and he builds him a loop
And he lassoed the Devil's hind feet
They stretched him out, they tailed him down
While the irons was a-gettin' hot
They cropped and swallow-forked his ears
And they branded him up a lot
Well they pruned him up with a dehorning saw
Tied knots in his tail for a joke
Then they rode off and left him there
Necked up to a black-jack oak

So if you're ever up in the Sierry Petes
And you hear one hell of a wail
Know it's that Devil a-bellowin' 'round
About them knots in his tail
You'll know it's that Devil a-bellowin' around
About them knots in his tail
