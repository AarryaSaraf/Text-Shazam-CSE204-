// Crazy //

Crazy
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wondering
What in the world did I do

I'm crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

I'm crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

// Do You Want To Build A Snowman? //

Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away!

We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye

Do you want to build a snowman
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by

Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye

Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "have courage"
And I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in

We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay... bye

Do you want to build a snowman?

// Have A Little Faith In Me //

When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark, baby
And have a little faith in me

When the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin'
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch ya, I will catch your fall
Just have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Well, I've been loving you for such a long time now
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time is our friend
'Cause for us there is no end
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

// Heartbreak Song //

I heard you told your friends I wrote you a breakup song
The funny thing is it wasn't even about you
Okay, maybe I did, so what if it was
That don't make you a king, the world ain't revolving around you

I'm in my car, riding around
My bass is up, no slowing down
Love ain't a game, don't got no time
No you don't see me crying, no, baby, baby

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard, I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed
And I'm okay, I'm just better without you

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing my mind, and baby it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on so
I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song

You called to tell me that you made a mistake
But that was something I knew
So now baby, baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm at the bar, martini twist
Boy, hook it up, just read my lips
Love ain't a game, don't got no time
No you don't see me crying

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard, I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed
And I'm okay, I'm just better without you

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing my mind, and baby it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on so
So I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song

No, no, no
I've been a hot mess, looking in the mirror (but if you need me)
But if you need me, I will be swinging from the chandelier

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
Betting on, betting on
I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song
I ain't gonna give you what you're betting on
Cause boy you don't deserve a single word
Don't know if you heard, I forgot all about you
I ain't gonna bore you with a sob story
Go crying to my friends and throw a hate party
It's so overrated, overplayed
And I'm okay, I'm just better without you

I'm going out and making my own rules
One thing my mind, and baby it ain't you
I'm turning up, I got it going on so
So I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song

I ain't gonna hit you with a heartbreak song

// Hold On //

When you're afraid
I'm right beside you
When you're in the dark
I'll come and find you
There is no door
I'll leave unopened
And there is no chance
I'll leave it broken

So hold on, hold on
Don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
I'll never stop fighting
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me
Hold on to me

If there's a prayer
I'm gonna pray it
When there's an answer
I'll be right here waiting
And there ain't a stone I won't turn over
A weight too heavy on my shoulder
A fire that I won't walk through
You know I got you, I got you

So hold on, hold on
And don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
I'll never stop fighting
Believing
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me
Hold on to me

Don't know if you're listening
But if you can hear me

Just hold on, hold on
And don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
And I'll never stop fighting
Believing
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me

// How You Love Someone //

Do you stand in the driveway and wave 'til the car is gone
Do you have to watch that movie every time it's on
Can you sleep alone as long as the porch lights on
Yeah, I wanna know how you love someone

Would you learn to like Hank Williams and red wine
Do you start talking and lose all track of time
When that song comes on, do you take it as a sign
Oh, I wanna know how you love someone

I wanna know how it sounds
When the words are coming out of your mouth
And your heart has finally figured it out
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone

When you go back home, has it always been too long
Is nothing really true 'til you tell it to your mom
Do you fight just to fight or are you alright being wrong
Come on, I wanna know how you love someone

I wanna know how it sounds
When the words are coming out of your mouth
And your heart has finally figured it out
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone

Does your laugh get a little higher
Does the weight of the world get a little lighter
Do you let go first or do you hold on too long

I wanna see what it's like
When you're looking into somebody's eyes
And you're falling and you mean it this time
I wanna know how it feels
When you feel it and the feeling is real
If it's a matchstick minute or forever burning like the sun
Oh, something tells me the way that I couldn't get enough
Baby, I wanna know how you love someone
I wanna know how you love someone

// I Still Pray //

Life ain't always all red roses, even gold ain't always golden
When it rains it loves to pour and I just can't take no more
But I know you can fix my broken

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
There's nothing you can't do, nothing you can't change
That's the reason I still pray

For the people who are hurting, who just can't catch a break
For the ones that keep on searching but they just can't find a way
When it rains it loves to pour, that's when my knees hit the floor
And I know I'm not alone when I say

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
There's nothing you can't do, nothing you can't change
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason I still pray
The reason, that's the reason, that's the reason

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
Would you wrap me in your arms, hold me 'til my heart unbreaks
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason I still pray

// It's No Mistake //

Ever since I met you,
I'm all about you.
Never wrote a love song,
until I felt you.
Feelin' like the new me.
Fit together perfect.
All the time I waited,
but you were worth it.

I knew that,
the minute you walked in,
there's no doubt,
that I don't wanna live without you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

We don't need a party,
to keep dancin'.
Bein' in your arms,
is like livin' in a mansion.
So fancy,
I couldn't imagine.
I don't wanna sleep,
cause I'll miss out on the action.

I knew that,
the minute you walked in,
there's no doubt,
that I don't wanna live without you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

ooooooooh
ooooooooh

It's no mistake,
I am with you.
I love the way,
you do what you do.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

One look at your face,
and I knew right away.
It's no mistake,
I am with you.

It's no mistake,
I am with you.

I am with you.

It's no mistake...

// Nice Things //

I am priceless, don't you know?
But you broke me even so
Oh, shiny, golden diamond rings
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things

Held me tightly as you dared
And when I cried out, you did not care
You stole my heart and bent my wings
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things

Oh, little boy with all your toys out in the yard
I gave you the moon
But you had to have the stars
Took 'em from the sky and you left them in the dark
'Til they rusted right through

Precious memories gone like that
You can't ever buy them back
No you cannot afford these dreams
Like momma always said
You can't have nice things

Ooh, ooh

You can't keep me a lock and key
Just to satisfy your needs
Oh, don't you know why the caged bird sings?
Like momma always said
You can't have nice things
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things

// Nothing Else Matters //

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
But I know

(I know, I know)
(Never cared)

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

I never cared for what they say
I never cared for games they play
I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

// O Holy Night //

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the Angel's voices
O night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born
O night divine
Oh, night, oh, night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His Gospel is peace
Chains shall He break, for our sisters and our brothers
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever

Noel, Noel
Oh, night, oh, night divine
Noel, Noel
Oh, night, oh, night dickdivine

(O holy night
O holy night)
(O night divine) O holy night, yeah
(O holy night
O holy night) O holy night
(O holy night) O holy night, when Christ was born
(O night divine
O holy night)...

// Sister //

I know it's hard being strong
And not getting lost in a man's world
It's gonna try to break you down
But you gotta not give a damn girl
Yeah, it makes you jaded
Yeah, it makes you tough
When it knocks us down
We gotta pick each other up

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

You gotta lot of dirt on me
You know every sin, every secret
Tell me the cold hard truth
A little white lie when I need it
Yeah, sometimes we fight
Call each other out
It don't matter 'cause we know that's what it's all about

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

I'm your local dive bar
Karaoke in the car
You're my "where you at?" text
When I run into my ex
I'm your drink-pouring shrink
Shake it off
Ain't no thing
You're my thick
You're my thin
Through it all till the end

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

// Somethin' Bout You //

It's hard to put a finger
On exactly what you do
But you got me in my feelings
And that ain't something I'm used to
I don't mind, I kinda like it
Don't need nothing new
You can just keep doing what you do

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout you

You being you, babe
It sure gets me in the mood, babe
Why you gotta be so smooth, babe
It's so rude, babe
And I just can't get me enough

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout me
There's somethin' 'bout us, boy
There's somethin' 'bout we
There's somethin' 'bout you
Ooh, there's somethin' 'bout you

Ain't nothing I would change
Nobody could take your place

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
Yeah, I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout me
There's somethin' 'bout us, boy
There's somethin' 'bout we
There's somethin' 'bout you
Oh yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you

Yeah, boy, there's somethin' 'bout you
There's just somethin' 'bout you
Yeah, boy, there's somethin' 'bout you

// Without A Net //

Wasn't born to do anything half way
Wasn't born to try just a little
'Cuz that's just the way
Just the way that I'm made
I'm not made to live in the middle, the middle
So many people play it safe and
Spend their lives chained to limitations
But not me

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall
Fly
Fly

Wasn't born to give anything but my best
Wasn't born to ever surrender
I would rather give my life this one life I get
Live it like the greatest adventure, adventure
Too many people take the safe road
But I'm not made to go where they go
That's not me

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall

With no pain, there's no glory
I'm gonna write my own story
Starting now
Pushing hard every minute
Pushing past every limit
Won't look back, won't back down

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
