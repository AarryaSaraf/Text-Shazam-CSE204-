// You've Changed //

You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed

You've changed
Your kisses are now so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand you've changed

You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared

You've changed
You're not the anges I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed

You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared

You've changed
You're not the anges I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed
I miss you

// I Was Telling Her About You //

My arms were around her, my eyes were aglow
But the moment was tender, the music was low
While we were dancing, I think you should know
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

She kept coming closer, the magic was there
She wore an expression that made people stare
It looked so romantic, darling, I swear
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm
When you passed by and caught my eye
You didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard, mmm-hmm
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
The girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her, ooh, I was telling her
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

Mmm-hmm, when you passed by and caught my eye
Baby, you didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
Ooh, the girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her about you
Only telling her about you

// I Wonder //

I wonder my darling...
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder...

My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking.
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now I wonder...

I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been traveling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know, what I wanna know is will it last?

Oh oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?

Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Oh yeah-he-he baby I wonder...

I've been through, I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm livin' life, livin' it just the same
I've been traveling, been traveling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know right now, what I wanna know is will it last?

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder my my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder

Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder

// I'll Be Around //

I'll be around no matter how you treat me now,
I'll be around from now on.
Your latest love can never last,
And when it's past, I'll be around when she's gone.

Goodbye again and if you find a love like mine,
Just now and then drop a line
to say you're feeling fine.
And when things go wrong,
perhaps you'll see you're meant for me,
So, I'll be around when she's gone.

// Because Of You //

Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever, and never to part

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you

// I Don't Know Why //

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't why, but I do
I don't know why you thrill me like you do
I don't know why, but you do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why, but I do

// I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face //

I've grown accustomed to her face. 
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune that
She whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now;
Like breathing out and breathing in.
I was serenely independent and content before we met;
Surely I could always be that way again-
And yet 
I've grown accustomed to her look; 
Accustomed to her voice; 
Accustomed to her face

But I'm so used to hear her say 
"Good morning" ev'ry day. 
Her joys, her woes, 
Her highs, her lows, 
Are second nature to me now; 
Like breathing out and breathing in. 
I'm very grateful she's a woman 
And so easy to forget; 
Rather like a habit 
One can always break- 
And yet, 
I've grown accustomed to the trace 
Of something in the air; 
Accustomed to her face.

// When Your Lover Has Gone //

What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

// When I'm Alone I Cry //

Laughin' loud out with the crowd
Is just one way I try
To hide my gloom
But in my room 
When I'm alone 
I cry

I confess, I do my best
To show them I'm the guy
I wear a smile, but all the while
When I'm alone
I cry

Pretending I don't miss her
It's all that's left to do
Somehow I'm sure 
She'll come back no more,
The rest is up to you

Smile my heart and play the part
Though deep inside we know,
It's all a game, but all the same
When I'm alone 
I cry

Pretending I don't miss her
It's all, it's all that's left to do
Somehow I'm sure
She'll come back no more
The rest is up to you, dear

Smile my heart, and play the part
Though deep inside we know
It's all a game, but juts the same
The truth must never show
On you

I realize my heart you know why
When I'm alone...
I, I cry

// If My Heart Could Sing //

I could write a million letters
Quote from every poem I've ever read
Sing each song that I've ever heard to you

But there's one thing I'd do better
If I had a voice instead
And the part of me that holds my love for you

If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring
If my heart could sing, sing

I'd sing of love to tell my story
Of how love brought me you
And like a bell I'd toll and ring
If my heart could sing

There are things I'd like to tell you
Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say

Oh, I'd prove to you I'll always love you
Girl, I will, till the end of time
I'll make you today eternal spring
If my heart could sing

There are things that I'd like to tell you
Like how I'll never, ever forget you
If my heart, my heart could only sing, sing, sing
