Album: HowSweetItIsToBeLovedByYou

// You're A Wonderful One //

You are so wonderful
That being near you is all I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[From now on, backing vocals: "Wonderful one"]
In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothin', baby, in return
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one
My darlin', you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Ooo you're a wonderful one
Mmm hmm you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence you speak to me
Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek
It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Repeat and fade:]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one

// How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) //

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
and there you were
With sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night,
wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore,
everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

[Repeat and fade:]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

// Try It Baby //

Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine

But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby

You'll see
Nobody loves you but me

Now you tell me that you so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine

Well move on back cross the track, baby
Where you came from
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby

You'll see
That nobody loves you but me
Nobody loves you but me

I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friend, friend, friend
But take your name from the bright lights baby
And tell me that you are all through
Come on and
Try it honey
Try it baby
Try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see, nobody loves you but me

// Baby Don't You Do It //

Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart
'Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keepin' on
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, oh don't do it baby
Don't break my heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best
Don't you do it, don't break my heart

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it
[...and fade]

// Need Your Lovin' (Want You Back) //

Won't you keep my heart aglow, baby

This sad feeling
Is almost worse than dying, yeah

Can't you understand, girl? (Can't you understand?)
I need your lovin', I want you back

(Need your lovin', want you back)

// One Of These Days //

Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
And on that day, when I up and leave you
You can beat your life that I won't be back no more
Sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

I know that I'm just a fool for you
Nobody has to tell me the way I am
It's the way I feel that make a difference
You see I love you so much that I don't care how I am

Hey now, what am I supposed to do
When you find out your love was untrue
Hey now, just have to stay
'Cause I don't have enough left to walk away

One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
Until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with me

// No Good Without You //

Girl, before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

Well, I've got money, and I've got fame
But if you leave me, it don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging, baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying, love, to let you know
That's why I'm trying, baby, to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me

I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

Your love, it made me ten feet tall
Your leaving leaves me nothing at all
What did I do, baby, to make you wanna go?
What did I say, baby, to hurt you so?
What's come between us? Can it be
Somebody has stole your love from me?
Oh, oh, oh baby
Baby, please, please don't leave me
If you leave me, baby, I'll be in misery

No good without you, baby
I'll be no good without you, baby

Well, take my money, and take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
Oh, I'll keep on begging, baby, please don't go
And I'll love you harder than I did before
'Cause I'll be crying when you close the door
'Cause I know, I know when you go

I'll be no good without you, baby
Baby, don't leave me
I'll be no good without you, baby
Oh, don't leave me, baby, baby
Oh, I'll be no good without you, baby

// Stepping Closer To Your Heart //

I wanna be closer
Closer to your heart
'Cause last night I dreamed
That we were drifting apart

Now I beg you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer
(Closer to your heart)

Let me closer
Closer to your kiss
For without it, my darling
I couldn't exist

Oh, I beg you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer
(Closer to your kiss)

Oh wee, honey yeah

[Background:]
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer to your heart
Closer to your heart

I wanna be closer
Closer to your embrace
That's where I long to be forever
Any time or any place

I'm begging you
Darling please
Say you will
Set my mind at ease
Let me be closer
Closer to your heart

Closer to your heart
Just a little bit closer
Closer to your heart
I'm heading
Heading your direction
I'm looking for
Love and some affection
Let me closer baby
Just a little closer
Darling let me closer

// Need Somebody //

Oh well, I'm the kind of guy that always needs
Somebody
Oh well, I'm the kind of guy that tries to keep me
Someone
Oh, somebody

Someone to walk with
To talk with
Tell all my troubles to
Somebody

Hey angel
Won't you tell me when you
When you get ready
I'll give you love
Love like you never had before
(I'll make you happy)
I'll give you everything I got
If you tell me that you'll be my
(Someone)

I'll give you everything I got
Oh, yeah

Have you ever had a feeling that you wanna hold
(Someone)
Somebody
Baby I got that feeling, I got to hold
(Someone)
Somebody

Someone to stand by me
Try me
I'll never let you down

// Me And My Lonely Room //

Me and my lonely room
Snapping my fingers, pacing the floor
I sulk in my lonely room as I lay my weary head
Down then in comes you're vision you're vision once 
Again I cry in my pillow baby

Pacing the floor no were to go as I stroll through the streets
Dragging my weary head down then in comes you're vision you're vision once 
Again 
Then he goes boo hoo
[lyrics repeat and fade]

// Now That You've Won Me //

Now that you've won me
I hope that you'll remember how
Don't you forget it (no, baby)
Because you know I love you now
Keep on being sweet and kind in the same old way
Keep on saying that you're mine, each and every day

Now that you've won me
Now that you've won me

Now that you've got me
I hope the heartaches don't begin
I hope my heart was not just a bet you had to win
Keep on kissing me day and night
Don't you ever change
Keep holding me tight
Don't you dare start acting strange

Now that you've won me
Now that you've got me

I felt it quite a while ago, but I had to say "no"
I wouldn't admit it to myself
But I guess it's right that the truth comes to the light
I'll admit, this is it, baby
I'll admit, this is it

Now that I'm yours
I hope you keep me for you own
Don't misuse me and then leave me all alone
Keep on saying the things that you said when we first met
I hope you still remember them
I hope you don't forget

Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours
Now that you've got me
Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours
Now that you've got me

// Forever //

Darlin', forever, forever
You can break my heart
Forever, if you want to
I'll play the part of a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, darling, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

I'll be your slave
For the rest of my days
Love you more in so many ways
Just to be with you thrills me through and through

And darlin', forever, forever
You can taunt me
Take my love for granted
But I'll always be just a fool
Just to be with you forever

Forever, forever, I'll love you so
[...and fade]
