// Ain't No Mountain High Enough //

Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no, darling

No wind, no rain
Nor winter's cold
Can't stop me baby

No no baby

Cause you are my goal

If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

Oh baby!

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough

// You've Got What It Takes //

You don't drive a big fine car.
You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far.
But baby, you got what it takes.

Satisfied, you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire.
You got what it takes for me.

You don't live in a beautiful place.
You don't dress with the best of taste.
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face,
But baby you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You've got what it takes for me.
Now when you're near me
My head goes around and round.
And when you kiss me
My love comes tumblin' down.
You send me

You don't live in a beautiful place.
You don't dress with the best of taste.
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face,
But baby you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You've got what it takes for me.
Now when you're near me
My head goes around and round.
And when you kiss me
My love comes tumblin' down.
You send me

You got what it takes for me
You got what it takes for me
You got what it takes for me

// If I Could Build My Whole World Around You //

[M:]
If I could build my whole world around you, darlin'
First I'd put heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky
And I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have the whole world built around you
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

[T:]
If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
I'd put joy where there's never been love
And I'd give my love to you
To keep for the rest of your life
And happiness would surely be ours
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

[Both:] Doo doo doo doo...

[M:] Oh, if I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess
[T:] And I'd step into this world you've created
And give you true love and tenderness
And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by

[Repeat and fade:]
[M:] If I could build my whole world around you
[T:] If I could build my whole world around you
[Both:] Then that would be all right, oh yeah

// Something Stupid //

I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: "I love you"

I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And oh the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: "I love you"
("I love you, I love you,...")

// Your Precious Love //

[Marvin:]
Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus:]
[Tammi:] Heaven must have sent you from above
[Both:] Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[T:]
And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'

[Chorus]

[M:] To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
[T:] I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

[M:] What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
[T:] And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

[Repeat chorus and fade]

// Hold Me, Oh My Darling //

I want you to hold me, oh my darling
& never, never let me go
Oh kiss me & tell me you love me
Yeah yeah because I, I I I I I, I I love you so
(I I love you, I love you so)

When I'm alone, alone & troubled
& my life seems dark as night
All I ask, I'll ask you please
Yeah yeah, baby won't you be, won't you be be be, be my guiding light
(Won't you be be my guiding light)

You know I get such a strange sensation
Every time I hear your name
Now all of my friends & my relations
They say I'm loving you (loving you) loving you in vain
Yeah yeah

Snuggle, snuggle on my shoulder
Come on & tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me that you care
& as my love, my love, my love, my love grows older
Yeah yeah, tell me that the flame, that the flame flame flame
Flame will still be there
(That the flame flame will still be)

Yeah yeah (darlin', wo oh)
Hold me baby (darlin', wo oh) hold me

// Two Can Have A Party //

Who needs the noise of a party crowd
Who needs the records turned up loud
When two, we two can have a party all alone?
Oh yeah

Ooo pretty music, a cozy chair
Lights down low and I'm holding you near
Oh baby, we two can have a party all alone
Oh yeah

[Twice]
When we are together, I'm like a feather
Floating in the air
I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you are there
Oh baby
Me and you, you and me
We can have a party, just wait and see
Oh well, two, we two can have a party all alone
Yes we can

Baby, two, we two can have a party all alone
Nobody else, you and me, hah, all alone
Pretty, pretty music, a cozy chair, yeah

// If This World Were Mine //

[M:]
If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[T:]
If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[M:] Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me
[T:] And honey, you're my inspiration
And there's so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

[M:] And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me
[T:] With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful

[Both:]
Give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me
You know I need you, baby
Really, really need you, baby

// Sad Wedding //

It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

We fell in love, first day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say

It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile

We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding

And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears, tears, tears
And the tears

// Give A Little Love //

Oh my love if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
[MG:] To you, 
[TT:] You

[BOTH:] Have a little faith, just a little faith 
In me & I will do 
The things I should for you 
Give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
[MG:] To you, 
[TT:] You

[MG:] I know I've strayed far far away from your arms 
Yeah baby, just like a fool 
[TT:] I hope & I pray that you'll let me return 
So I can make love, make love, make love to only you

[BOTH:] Oh my love, if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true

// Oh How I'd Miss You //

[TT:] My lovin' heart would shake 
More than the earth could break 
If you should ever go 
You know my heart would break 
[MG:] If I lost your sweet embrace 
Even time could not erase 
The memories of you 
Tears would cover up my face

[CHORUS:] 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you, baby 
[MG:] I need you so 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you 
[TT:] Baby never go 
[MG:] I'll never leave

[TT:] My world would cease to be 
Without the love you give to me 
The chains around my heart 
Would never set me free 
[MG:] When my life had just begun 
My sky didn't have a sun 
You fill my every need 
So if you ever leave

[CHORUS] 

[Backing, x2]
(Oh how I'd miss you, baby baby)

[MG:] Oh you're always on my mind 
Losin' you would leave me blind 
Fill my heart forevermore 
Never leave my love behind 
[TT:] With the joy your love can bring 
To you I'll always cling 
If you took away your love 
It would be the end of things, &...

[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you

[TT:] Marvin, I need you so 
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you
