// Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing //

Ooooh baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Oh honey
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

Ooooo, I read your letters you're not here
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Don't you know
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game, a fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

Oh, I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there

So glad we got the real thing baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh honey
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
No darling
Ain't nothing like the real thing 
Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

// You're All I Need To Get By //

You're all I need to get by

Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
With arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door

Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need to get by
You're all, all I need, oh baby
You're all I want...

// Keep On Lovin' Me Honey //

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true

[Both:] Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
[M:] Oh Tammi
[T:] What good am I without you
[M:] I can't do without you, darlin'
[Both:] Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
[T:] Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind

'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me

// Baby Doncha Worry //

When the dawn comes over the mountain
And when the valley is filled with dew
Don't worry, baby, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

When the moon rises to kiss the stars above
And when it sets deep in the blue
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm home, I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

Don't worry about me
I still care
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Don't worry about me, baby
'Cause I'll be there
(Don't worry, baby, don't worry)

I still love you and I always will
Till my life is over, baby, baby
Till time stand still
Till time stand still

Don't worry about me
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I'll still love you, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Don't worry about me, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I'm gonna stick right by your side, baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

I said don't, don't, don't
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Don't worry about me
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
Baby, don't cha worry, ain't goin' to worry
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

Because I, I, I, I, I
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)
I still love you baby, I love you baby
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

I said, no, no, no, no, no
(Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry)

// You Ain't Livin' Till You're Lovin' //

You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
love was heartaches and tears
baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all

To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
but before you go, think about my proposition
you may conquer the world and be king on a throne
but you still ain't nobody, baby
when you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

[Repeat]

// Give In, You Just Can't Win //

You can try to win my love, but it's just too late
Try & try again, but to lose me is your fate
You can walk the streets till your feet refuse
But you won't find me; you'll find only the blues
Oh nothin' but the blues, oh baby
So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win
No, you just can't win

[MG:] Oh baby, baby, honey
You did me wrong when my love was true
You just led me on; now I've gone away from you, darlin'
If you call me on the phone to remove your pain
There'll be a busy signal, or else an endless ring
Oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win, oh
[TT:] Oh baby, give in

[Instrumental]

[MG:] Tell me, what do you get when you call me, honey?
[TT:] Just an endless ring, oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
[Both:] So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win
[TT:] No, you just can't win
[MG:] Oh oh oh oh

[TT:] Oh baby give in, you know you just can't win
[MG:] Don't want your love no more, darlin'
[TT:] This stuff has got to stop
[MG:] Ah I can't stand it
[TT:] Don't need the love you got
[MG:] I don't want your love no more
[TT:] I've tried it before
[MG:] I don't want you no more, baby
[TT:] I don't need you no more
[...& fade]

// When Love Comes Knocking At My Heart //

[TT:] Ooo here I am alone, thinkin' aimlessly
Seein' other girls in love & wishin' it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'

[MG:] Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the mornin' 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[MG:] Oh if you've never been in love, darlin'
Then you're just like me, now
[TT:] Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?
Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before
[MG:] She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet

[Both:] When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'
[TT:] Oh darlin', [MG:] Oh darlin'

[TT:] When love comes, I'm gonna let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darlin', when love comes
[...& fade]

If you need a lover
Truer than any other

Su-yu-gar, sugar (come on & see me now)
If you want it, better come & get it
Ho-yo-ney, honey (come on & see me now)

// I Can't Help But Love You //

[T:] Hey Marvin! M: Yeah Tammi?
[T:] Listen to me baby
Take a plane a million miles and stay 100 years
And come back baby, and I'll be waiting here
I'll be true to you, I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cause this love I have is just for you to share
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you, ooo

[M]: I don't care to know how far I have to fly
I don't care to know how many stars are in the sky
There's just one thing, baby, that I've got to know
Will you love me forever, never let me go?
Oh Tammi! T: Yeah Marvin? M: Oh baby

[Both:] I'll be lovin' you, I can't help myself
I'll be lovin' you and nobody else
I'll be lovin' you, oh yes I will
[T:] Till I'm old and gray
[M:] Till my heart stands still, oh Tammi!
[T:] Oh Marvin, tell me why do you love me?

[M:] I was just a rollin' stone goin' nowhere
Empty like a hollow room filled with despair
Then, like a rainbow and a pot of gold
You came into my life and you saved my very soul
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you
[M:] Tell me, why do you love me?

[T:] I was so alone like a leaf without a tree
When out of the darkness your love lifted me
And I'm so grateful, baby I'm so glad
'Cause your sweet sweet love is the best I've ever had

[repeat and fade:]
[Both:] Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you, ooo
I'll be lovin' you, I can't help myself
I'll be lovin' you and nobody else
I'll be lovin' you, oh yes I will
[T:] Till I'm old and gray
[M:] Till my heart stands still

// I'll Never Stop Loving You Baby //

[TT:] There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire & keeps the flame inside me
I love it, Marvin
[MG:] Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Somethin' inside me keeps me yearnin', ooo baby

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

[TT:] Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe
[MG:] Near to you, I feel so strong
& I know I can right any wrong
Lovin' you gives me the power that I always need

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

[MG:] Baby, tell me baby
[TT:] Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you
[MG:] That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Givin' my love to you, dear

[BOTH:] I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no
[MG:] Tammi, I'll never stop, stop
[BOTH:] No no no no
[TT:] I'll never stop lovin' you, no no no no
[fade]

// That's How It Is (Since You've Been Gone) //

[MG:] Oh baby, there's a letter on the floor
That I just can't read no more
'Cause the words upon its face are sayin' goodbye
There's a plate upon the table
Filled with food I could not eat
There's a made-up bed in the bedroom where I couldn't sleep
I just sit & weep
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[TT:] Now the curtains are drawn in my lonely room
& the darkness fills the air
& this old empty heart of mine is in despair
Even though the tears I shed
Washed the words away
I could still remember every word you had to say
They just wouldn't go away
Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone

[Instrumental]

[MG:] Oh baby, you knew right from the start
That my heart was in your hands
[TT:] & your every, every wish, boy, was my command
That's why I can't understand
How you could leave me here helpless, dear
Alone & afraid, oh how could such a mistake be made?
But that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone, oh baby

[Both (repeat & fade):]
That's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so alone

// Memory Chest //

Every little kiss you give to me I'll store in my memory chest
Even all the tears I shed will be there along with your warm caress

Oh darling, there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest just for me

Every letter that you write to me I'll store in my memory chest
Oh Tammi, so I can look back and read the words and I'll reminisce

I'm not sayin' that you're going to leave me
But there's one thing I do believe, it's possible, you see
Baby, I'm gonna store them away in my memory chest just for me

In my memory chest, baby, sweet sweet memories, baby
Every kiss, each caress, all your love and tenderness
In my memory chest, baby

You promised me that our love would last till the end of time
Just in case you see another girl that can change your mind

Every happy moment I spend with you I'll store in my memory chest
Oh baby, you have filled my life, my life with much love and tenderness

Oh darlin', there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest, every little thing

Baby, gonna [?] in my memory chest
Every letter, baby
Ooh, yes I will darlin'
Just for me

Just for me
Oh darling, just for me, baby
Baby, baby, just for me
