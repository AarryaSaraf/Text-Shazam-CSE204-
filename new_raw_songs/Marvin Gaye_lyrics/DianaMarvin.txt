// You Are Everything //

Oh darling
I want to be everything to you

Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do
I thought it was you
As he turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
'Cause you are everything
And everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

// Love Twins //

Get closer to me
Love twins, love twins
Let's be love twins
Let's create a love that will never end
Let's show the world love can win, darling
I want you for more than just my friend
I love you, baby
I love you, too, Marvin
Because we've been friends for such a long time
For loving you has constantly been on my mind

And all I want, baby, from you
I want a lover, not a friend, yeah
Let's be love twins

Let's be as one, darling, yeah
Like the sign of the Gemini
Oh close together, you and I
Let people say you won't see
One without the other
Let 'em be aware that you and I are lovers

All I want, baby, from you
I want a lover, not a friend, yeah
Let's be love twins

Oh baby, come on in, love twins
Oh girls, let's walk together, yeah
Hand in hand
I'll be your woman, Marvin
If you'll be my man
Together I know we can make it
As lovers, not friends
Oh baby, come on, let's be love twins
Please, oh let's walk together

Let's be love twins, hand in hand
You'll be my woman and I'll be your man
Just we two, babe, honey, me and you
Together we can create
Something different, something new
Let's be love twins
Let's be love twins, sugar

// Don't Knock My Love //

Don't knock my love
Don't hold you up
And my kisses don't set your stuff
Don't be afraid, to let me know
There's other places woman, that I can go

If you don't like it (don't like it)
Don't knock it, (don't knock it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to rock it
If you don't need it (don't need it)
Don't waste it (don't waste it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to taste it

If my thrill, don't turn you on
And my will baby, is much to strong
Don't waste my time with your foolish ways
I got other things to do with my days

If you don't like it (don't like it)
Don't knock it, (don't knock it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to rock it
If you don't need it (don't need it)
Don't waste it (don't waste it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to taste it

Going up, going down, going all way around town
I'm the one, that turn you on
I'm the same one to leave you alone
Don't knock my love, don't knock my love
Don't knock my love

// You're A Special Part Of Me //

You're a special part of me
Special part of me

That special tear I shed means you're a part of me
Thoughts of you running through my head
Means you're a part of me
Yeah, I'm satisfied to know you're a part of me

What I want to say is
All I want to say is
Is that I love you
'Cause you're that very special part of me
Oh, oh, baby

Every time you look into my eyes
(Yes, baby)
Can't you see what you mean to me
(Talk to me)

And every time you hear me speak your name
(Oh, baby)
Can't you tell what you mean to me
(Ah, mercy)

Oh, can't move the moon
You can't stop the passing time
Anyway by now you can't move this love of mine
Just as simple as the last rerun

What I want to say is
All I want to say is
Is that I love you
'Cause you're that very special part of me

Oh, when the morning comes I wipe the sleep from my eyes
Well, I can't wipe away what I feel inside
Can't find the cure for not having you around
(Sugar)
Oh I've searched far and near
Ah, but the cure just can't be found, no, no, no

That special tear I shed means you're a part of me
Thoughts of you running through my head
Means you're a part of me
I'm satisfied to know that you're a part of me

All I want to say is
What I want to say is
That I love you
'Cause you're that very special, very special

I love you, oh, words cannot explain
That I love you, sugar you're that special thing
I love you every time I shed that special tear
I love you every time I feel that special thing for you

I love you

// Stop! Look, Listen (To Your Heart) //

[Marvin:]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you
Have you asked why
You seem to fall in love and out again
Do you really ever love
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why fool yourself
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, oh, love, love

[Diana:]
Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel
This time decide
That you will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharin' love you feel within
So jump right in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late, too late to

Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Stop, look, oh, listen to your heart
Hear what it's sayin'
Love, love, love

[Both:]
Darlin', darlin', stop and look
(Stop right now and listen to your heart)
Oh, listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'
(Can't you see that it's not too late)
Stop and look
And listen to your heart hear what it's sayin'

Stop and listen to your heart right now
(Stop, look)

// I'm Falling In Love With You //

Falling, falling for you, falling
Sugar, I'm falling, I'm falling, falling
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over, though it's over
And each and every thing that you do
Brings us closer
Tighter, baby (tighter, baby)

But this time, I just wanna be sure
Your love is something meant to be good
Your love is so good, it's so good for me, baby (your love is so good)

Honey, you sting like a bee
But you're sweet as honey
Though you're cool like a breeze
You're stormy on Monday
You're soft like a rose, but a thorn sure ain't funny
It ain't funny, no, it ain't funny, baby (it ain't funny)

Think I'm falling in love with you
All over, though it's over, baby
Just can't wait to spend some time with you
So we'll get tighter (so we'll get tighter)
Closer, baby (ooh, closer, baby)

Though I've been down this road before (and I've been watching you)
I think I'll take my chances once more (I'm scared about it baby)
Just one more time (just one more time)

Sting like a bee (ooh, ooh)
Oh baby, but you're sweet as honey
Cool like a breeze, but you're stormy on Monday
Soft like a rose
But a thorn sure ain't funny
It ain't funny, not one bit
No, no, no, no, honey

I think I'm falling in love with you (ooh, ooh)
And I think I'm falling in love with you (baby)

Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Don't you see me falling?
Don't you see me falling?
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Don't you see me falling?
Don't you see me falling?
Falling in love
Falling in love

// My Mistake (Was To Love You) //

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put on my face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

Remember baby
When you took my heart
You said you'd never leave me
You said we'd never be apart
Ooh, all things changed
Oh, but sometimes things happen, honey
That we can't explain
(I know it, baby)
Oh, but it's all over now
I just want to love you again
Might as well consider me
A part of your life you have to keep

So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life

Well, here I am again
(Please, forgive me, baby)
Believing in what you say
(Baby [?] you know I love you)
Not knowing if you mean it
But love me in every word anyway
Don't you know
You gave my life its meaning
You made me what I am today
Darling, darling, I forgive you
I love you too much to stay away

So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
I guess you have to include me in your life, yeah

I will, I will
Why don't we take love
I feel the flight train
I'm ready
Let's not waste any time
Life is too short
Just to reminisce
Come on, come on
I'll feed you
I could fill your appetite
Include me in
Include me in

I say darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life...

// I'll Keep My Light In My Window //
