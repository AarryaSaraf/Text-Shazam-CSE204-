// Too Busy Thinking About My Baby //

Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah... Oh listen to me people

I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly

And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow

[Chorus:]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else

Said, I ain't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Tellin ya I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

[Chorus]

The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell ya
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

[Chorus]

(yeah, she's never hard to find
'cause she's always on my mind)

// This Magic Moment //

This magic moment, so different then so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened, hell, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, baby
Forever till the end, the end of time

Oh, oh, baby, this magic moment
Oh, baby

Ooh, sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, baby
Forever till the end of time

Oh, oh, baby, oh, honey
Oh, I know we'll last, we'll last, we'll last, we'll last forever
Oh, this magic moment, oh, gonna last forever, baby
Oh, I know, I know

// The End Of Our Road //

Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby
I gotta get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

Woman, I'm just thinkin' 'bout all the times you promised to call
and I sat at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm tired of your stuff
Say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more

Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
To hold on when I'm the one you're leavin'
Say I've 'bout had my fill of you (had my fill of you)
Flirtin's all through the years
And I've almost run out of tears
I'm tellin' you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to

The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road

[Repeat and fade:]
(Oh, this is the end, the end of our road)

// Seek And You Shall Find //

Oh I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me, true love is hard to find

So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find
That's what they would say

The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find

Sometimes I get so lonely
It seems useless to groan
But then I remember
Somewhere true love has waited there
But I'll keep on holding on
Keep on keeping on
But I know that I keep trying
I can lose
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh

There is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
You know that I'm gonna keep holding on
Cause I now if I keep trying
I can't lose, cause there's no denying
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Ohhh
Seek and you shall find
If it's love that you're looking for
Seek and you shall find
It must be right around the corner
Seek...

// Only A Lonely Man Would Know //

Ooh, once I thought that
Love was a toy for girls and boys
I never gave my heart
I just played the part right from the start

Then there was you, sweet you
With a love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Oh, just hangin' on, now love has gone

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside of me, since I left my pride
Make a fool of me

Ask any lonely man, you see, darlin'
Walk up and ask any lonely man like me, baby

Ooh, foolishly girl, I broke your heart
Now we're apart
Now, in my lonely room, I
Just reminisce, long for your kiss

And through my lonely tears
I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love
My world, my world's at an end

Blinds closin' in, now, I know
Oh, what I was too slow in learnin'
Oh, now I know
No that I'm all alone, my heart is yearnin'

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ask any lonely man, you see, baby
Go on and ask him, baby

Only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ooh, only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside

// Try My True Love //

Baby if you're walking down on a one way road
And heartaches are your heavy load
Don't you let it get you down
It's time to start looking around
And if you're looking for sincerity
C'mon girl look at me
If love's treated you unkind
I'm gonna make things right this time

If your poor heart has turned cold
C'mon
C'mon try my true love
If things got out of control
Baby try my true love

Honey don't lock your heart inside
A heart should always feel alive
With happiness flowing free
Full of love and never, never empty

So leave all the doubt behind
Reach out for love, try to find
Don't look back and be misled
Take my hand, future lies ahead

Oh baby
If you're looking for love and can't find it
C'mon try my true love

Don't let happiness pass you by
Take a step forward baby
You got to try
Honey you got to try

Put your heart in my hand
And I'll help you to understand
That darkness can be the light
If you go about it right

There's no need to be apart
I'll be waiting with open arms

If you leave past behind you
C'mon try my true love
If you're looking for love and can't find it
C'mon try my true love
If you are walking down a one way road
C'mon try my true love

// I Got To Get To California //

I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California right away
Just to see the evening sun setting in the west
Breaks my heart, reminds me of the true love that I left
In the sunset I can see my baby's face just haunting me
Reminding me of the tenderness that heaven knows was in her kiss
I had a love that was mine mine mine mine alone
But I played the fool and Lord I left my happy home
What a fool a man can be, but this loneliness inside of me says
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California

I wish I was there by my baby's side
Lord I wish I had listened to my heart and not my pride
She tried to tell me that I had no reason to tell her she was...
I was blinded by my pride and I just couldn't see
Now I've got to hurry, I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move, true love I'm gonna lose
I pray it's not too late, oh I might have to catch a freight
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California right away

Ohhhhh may have to hitchhike baby
Might have to hop a freight
Yea yeah now I've got to hurry
Now I've got a reason to worry
I've got to be on the move
Or true love I'm gonna lose
What a fool a man can be
But this loneliness inside of me says
I got to get to California right away
I got to get to California

Might have to hitchhike, baby
Might have to hitch a ride
Oh now now I got to get to California

// It Don't Take Much To Keep Me //

It don't take much
Don't take much
Yeah to keep me
No, not much

Just your touch
Just your tenderness
Just your sweet caress
Oh

Just the pleasure of your company
When I feel a little lonely, to comfort me
Just to to call you and know you are there
Take me through my day, oh without a care
If you worry about me leaving
Throw it out of your mind
Just as long as you want me I'll be right by your side

Oh, it don't take much
Just your touch
Yeah to keep me
Baby you got it
You got it baby
Got what it takes
It takes to keep me
To keep me

When the days go by and I don't see you darling
I might start to complain
But all you gotta do is talk to me sweet and plain
Let me know your love remains
Just say you need me, like I need you
That's enough to carry me through

You are my world
You are my everything
You're all my eyes can see
You're such a part of me

It's the little things you do
That keeps me loving you
It ain't what you do
It's the sweet way you do it
It ain't what you saying
Is the sweet way you're saying
Just let me know you're standing by
To what my eyes, I'll be satisfied

You are my world, you are my everything
You are all my eyes can see
Oh baby, you are such a part of me

Don't take much
No not much
Yeah to keep me
Baby you got it
I know you got it
You know you got it baby
Got what it takes
It takes to keep me
To keep me
Just your tenderness
That's enough baby
