// I'll Be Doggone //

Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey! I'd be long gone
Oh I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

Now did you hear what I say ?
Well now what I say
Oh, believe me Well, every woman should try
To be what ever has man wants her to be
And I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me

Well, I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like no baby could
If I ever found out that you're no good

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't de doggone baby
I'd be long gone

// Little Darling (I Need You) //

It's so hard lovin' you
But I don't wanna let you go
Little darlin' I need you (Little darlin' I need you)
Little darlin' I love you (Little darlin' I love you)
Little darlin' I want you (Little darlin' I want you)
Little darlin' I've got to have you (Little darlin' I've got to have you)
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Little darlin' I need you...

I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me
Then I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice
Oh baby

Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only
Now I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 at any sacrifice

Little darlin' I need you...
[...and fade]

// Take This Heart Of Mine //

Ooo, you say you're feelin' bad 'cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely

[Chorus:]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

[Chorus]

Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
To have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
It'll be the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (one more time, let's hold)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose

[Repeat chorus and fade]

// Hey Diddle Diddle //

Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
C'mon and love me, baby
C'mon and love me baby

Just like an apple
Hanging on a tree
Won't you come by and pick me off

Please don't wait too long
Pretty soon I might be gone
I might fall off and I'll be lost

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby

Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

I'm in misery
From this tortury
Won't you look in my eyes and see
That I'm in distress
From this loneliness
Truly your love is what I need
Oh
Oh baby

Just like
Over on the corner
About to get down on my knees
Beggin' Mary, Mary
Don't be contrary
Give my heart all the love it needs

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
Put it on me, baby
Put it on me, baby

Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

Like jello on a plate
I shiver and I shake
Every time that you come near
Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little

// One More Heartache //

One more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carryin' such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back
One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it

One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down
Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it
No no no baby

Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode
Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to burst

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it
No, honey, not another
[...and fade]

// Ain't That Peculiar //

Honey you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and i can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til i don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

I cried so much just like a child thats lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

[Chorus]

// Night Life //

in the evening
when the sun goes down
oh...you'll find me
hangin'round
cause the nightlife
aint no good life
but it's my life....oh...yes it is
many people just like you and me
are dreamin'about....how things used to be
but the nightlife ain't no good life
but it's my life

listen to the blues
they're playin'
listen to the blues
to what's saying...
hie...yeah......

home,it's just another place
oh...from that world of broken dreams

yes the nightlife ain't no good life
but it's my life... oh yes it is

sometimes it's sad...
then again it's happy..oh..mmmm sometimes

// You've Been A Long Time Coming //

You've been a long time coming
But darlin', welcome home
You've been a long time coming
But darlin', welcome home

So many nights I've called your name
Not knowing if I'd see you again
You've been a long time coming
But, oh, baby, welcome home

Feel, feel kinda, kinda, kinda good right now
Feel so good baby, yeah
You've been a long, real long time coming
But darlin', welcome home

You've been a long, long, long time coming
Oh, baby, welcome home

So many nights, I sit lookin' at the wall
Hoping, praying for your call
You've been a long, long time coming
But oh, baby, welcome home

Feel kinda good, so good right now
Feel so good, baby, yeah
Ha, feel so good having you home, baby
Yeah, yeah, ooh, don't ever leave me

// Your Unchanging Love //

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)
To your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now

Darlin', there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than paintin' the town
Only noon and night
'Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Chorus]

I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
'Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darlin', I'm tired of runnin' 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
'Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

[Chorus]

Darlin', everybody need somebody, ooo I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing:
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why...

[Repeat chorus and fade]

// You're The One For Me //

Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

Just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
Heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
You're the one that I've been waiting for
In this loneliness forever more

Baby, I know you're the one for me

Can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
Promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
Deep inside my heart I hope and pray
That someday you'll come to me and say
"baby, I know you're the one for me"

Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

Love is strong and I'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
If I'm wrong and mistaken, then I'll have to pay, sadly
No other love could ever be the same
If we fail, there's just yourself to blame

Oh baby, I know you're the one for me
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
So lonely
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
All of my life
You're the one for me
I'll never have another love
You're the one for me
For the rest of my life
You're the one for me

// I Worry About You //

I worry about you
When you're gone I get blue
So darling take care
I worry about you

I'm home every night
Wondering if you're alright
I knew when we met
That I'd worry about

You matter to me so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go

Whatever you do
Come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you

Honey, you, you, you matter to me
So, so, so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go

Whatever you do
Baby, come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you
Oh, baby
Honey, I worry
Oh, yeah

When you're out of my sight
I worry
Each and every night
I worry
Oh, baby
I can't help myself

// One For My Baby (And One More For The Road) //

It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em' up Joe, I got a little story
I think you should know
We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I know the routine, put another nickel
In the machine
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
Easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin'
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I found, It's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
