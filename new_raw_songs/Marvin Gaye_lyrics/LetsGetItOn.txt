// Let's Get It On //

I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Then come on, oh come on, ooh

Let's get it on, oh baby
Let's get it on, let's love baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, whoa

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give, understand me sugar
Since we got to be here
Let's live, I love you

There's nothin' wrong with me
Lovin' you, baby love, love
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby

(Let me love you)
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be? Oh, oh
(Let me love you)
I'm askin' you baby to get it on with me, oh oh

I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push

So come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush, hey

You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you
Let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey hey

So good somethin' like sanctified

// Come Get To This //

Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
Now I really went out of my mind
I miss your lovin' when you left, baby you did
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby let us, ah tell me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt long
Ah baby, come get to this

Ooo remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I've been waiting
I'm ready for you to start doin' the things
I'm tryin' to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I've been waiting
Come here, baby, get to this

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
Get back here from the depths, we have to get back
Oh, nothin's changed, you're still sweet as the mornin' rain
Girl, I'm standin' ready to
Love you, babe, make it good to you

Ooo I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this

Girl, I know you've been gone a long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, glad that you call me your baby
Oooo-eeee-oooo

// Distant Lover //

Distant lover, lover
So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you

Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn
Through the day

Distant lover
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me

Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce, oh baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters

Then, all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

Distant lover
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel?
Sugar, sugar

That every moment when I spent with you
I treasure it like it was
A precious jewel, oh baby
Lord have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you

My Lord I wonder
Do you wanna hear me scream, plead
And please, please, oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
Baby please, please

// You Sure Love To Ball //

Ooh Baby please turn yourself around
Ahh baby so I can love you
Ohh baby baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh baby just like you want me to
Ohhh
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby I hope you never freeze
I love you I love you so much
Ohh baby baby don't ever go no where
Ohh baby I'll love you night and day
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
Since you're my foxy lady, foxy lady
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(on my mind there's....)
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got ot get ready
(ohh)
Ohh baby You sure do love to ball
Ohh baby you sure do love to ball

// Just To Keep You Satisfied //

You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitchin' too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Ooo darling how could we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce

Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can really never outweigh the bad
Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby

Now it's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darlin'
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
Oh oh ohhh it's much too late
Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy
