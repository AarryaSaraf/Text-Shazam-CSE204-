Album: IHeardItThroughTheGrapevine

// You //

Ooh, you, you I see
In my mirror in the morning, 'stead of seeing me
I see you, I see your face
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace

In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
'Til the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous

Though it's wrong, I know
Girl, I love you so
Yes, I need you (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a hard-working boy
Oh, you've given your love to me (You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me

We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feeling in our hearts
We meet in shadows (We meet in shadows)
Your friends must never know (Your friends must never know)
That we are lovers, darling (That we are lovers)
Although it hurts me so (Although it hurts me so)

For your sake no one must see
The precious love you're giving me
But you know (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

(You, you, you, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you, you, you)

Oh, one day I'll make the grade, my lucky star will shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
'Til then we must go on ('Til then we must go on)
The way we have before (The way we have before)
And never let it show (And never let it show)
We love each other so (We love each other so)

Our love's a one-way track
And there's no turning back
Oh (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

You (You, you, you)
You I see (You, you, you)
Oh, in my mirror in the morning (You, you, you)
'Stead of seeing me (You, you, you)
I see you (You, you, you)
Seeing your face (You, you, you)

// Tear It On Down //

My
Oh baby
Listen

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause when you think only of yourself
You can't love anyone else
And I need you desperately
But with your head in the clouds you can't see me
So tear it all down

Tear it all down

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
In order to live life
In order to work
You must first come down to Earth
And I want you to give in
'Cause my love is so strong, it can win
So tear it all down

Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the ground

It's just a masquerade
So why don't you let it stay
How can I show what I need
When you got your pride standing in between

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause it will strip away one day
But my love is here to stay
We can make it, of that I am sure
But you just got to give a little more
So tear it all down

Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the ground

// Chained //

Seems just yesterday you were in my arms
And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared
I did all I know
To win your love and make it so
You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you,
How could you do me this way?
'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection
'Cause I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah

I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm gonna make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home
'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection
'Cause I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know

Oh baby, oh baby
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, gonna make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
'Cause I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chained
[...and fade]

// I Heard It Through The Grapevine //

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind

Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine baby

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby

People say believe half of what you see
Some and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah

// At Last (I Found A Love) //

At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
I found a love for me

Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me

At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Do you believe me? At last
Oh, I found a love for me
(One more thing)

I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

Ah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
At last, huh, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, yeah

Whoo
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
Listen
She's sweet, so sweet
Lord, she's the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oh yeah, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

At last
Ooh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, ah
I found a love for me

// Some Kind Of Wonderful //

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show that you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful

Ev'ry time my little world seems blue
I-I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I wanna say but the right words won't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I wanna say but the right words won't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
Lord!, this world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

Some kind of a soft love
Some kind of a warm love
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful, yes, it is, I-I-I know

[FADE]
Say I know

// Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever //

I remember yet before we met
When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one.
And I remember meeting you,
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, 'stead of only one.

When you said you loved me
We could not be parted.
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
I never felt so good before.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, you know it has.

Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day.
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy.
You know I'd be lost if you went away.

[Bridge:]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, I know it has.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.

[Bridge:]
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
I never felt so good before.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Yes it has, you know it has.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.
Don't you know my baby there.
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.

// Change What You Can //

Ooh, the girl I love walked out on me
Leaving her love flowing strong
Oh, my heart would like to carry on
But she said her feeling for me was gone
I tried to find the words to say to make her stay

But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

I know the girl is on her way
Taking the love I need so bad
Oh, the love I guessed I'd never have
So what's the use of sitting around and feeling sad
I must respect the fact she won't be back my way

Cause she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

I sit around in misery
Over a love that don't belong to me
I did everything I could to make her stay

But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change it, baby
Oh, change if you want to
You got to change, alright
Oh, change it, honey
Honey, you can change it

// It's Love I Need //

Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
Going crazy
Love I need
You can save me baby
Love I need

Can't go on, in this loneliness
When you took your love, you took my happiness
All these tears in my eyes won't let me find my way
And this aching in my heart is growing every day

C'mon home
It's so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

It's love I need
Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
I'm going crazy
Love I need
You can save me, darling
Love I need

Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

Love I need
Doctors can't save me
It's your love I need
And I'm going crazy
I need your love

// Every Now And Then //

Darling, why did I agree to ever let you go?
And why did I promise I'd never try to see you no more?
I thought I could find someone to take your place
Instead I find memories of you so hard to erase

'Cause every now and then
Someone speaks your name
Every now and then
I feel the flame
Same old burning
Burning deep within
To a dream I'm holding on
And all the time I know you're gone

Some times I sit alone and stare into the night
And in my mind I see myself holding you tight
Seems the love I feel is stronger than my will
Trapped in a world of despair
I close my eyes and pretend you're there

'Cause every now and then
I hear your voice calling
Every now and then
Girl, my tears start falling
Darling, beyond my control
I miss the mess of your touch
I miss the love I need so much

Every now and then
Every now and then
I keep remembering

Won't you come back baby
It's so hard living without you
Why don't you come back, baby
I miss everything about you

Why don't you come back
My whole world is crumbling
Why don't you come back
Every step I take without you, I'm stumbling

'Cause every now and then
I feel the hurt inside
Every now and then
I get you on my mind
Of fools of thinking I get over you
And every street I'm coming down
I see you all around

'Cause every now and then
Every now and then
I feel the flame burning
I feel my heart yarning
Every now and then
Oh I miss your touch
Every now and then

// You're What's Happening (In The World Today) //

Every time I see you, I'm spinning like the tops
Intoxicated lady, what you doing? Don't you stop
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Oh
You're what's happening in the world today

In my sleep I see you, darling, and you're lovely as a queen
Intoxicated lady, you bring joy to my dreams
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Hey
You're what's happening in the world today, oh baby

You're like a drink of something that's much too much
And get a kiss from you, it thrill me through and through
Now I don't know for sure but I think you'd like it too
Cause, oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
I said, baby

You should be in movies, in a fashion magazine
Any king would be so proud just to have you for a queen
A leading lady is what you are, girl you sho' nuff a star
You shall receive an award for the part you play in my heart
Oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
Oh baby, little darling
I know, I know
Don't my mama, don't tell father
No, no
Oh honey, baby

Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?

I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me so all alone
So all alone

I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side to be my guide

I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
