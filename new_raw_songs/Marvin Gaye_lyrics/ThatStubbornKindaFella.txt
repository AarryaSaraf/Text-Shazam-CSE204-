// Stubborn Kind Of Fellow //

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I try to put my arms around you
All because I wanna hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

[Instrumental]

I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)
I'm gonna love you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(Gonna love you in every way)

With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Repeat and fade:]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

// Pride And Joy //

You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all I know
And that's why you're my pride and joy

And I'm tellin' the world
You're my (pride and joy) pride and joy (pride and joy)
I believe I'm no (baby boy) baby boy (baby boy)
But I know you're mine (pride and joy)
My pride and joy (pride and joy)
Yeah baby (baby boy) Yeah baby (baby boy)

You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (pick me up) when I'm down (when I'm down)
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town (whole town)
And that's why (that's why)
I believe you're my (you're my) pride and joy (pride and joy)

[Repeat and fade:]
(Pride and joy)[x4] (baby boy)[x2]
(Pride and joy) My pride and joy (pride and joy)
And I love you like a baby loves his toy (pride and joy)

// Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home) //

By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry.
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
for I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance
over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
that I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye,
everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them,
break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
wherever I lay my hat that's my home.
wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh,
that's my home
and I like it that way.

// Soldier's Plea //

While I'm away, darling
How often do you think of me?
Remember, I'm over here
Fighting to keep us free
Just be my little girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

They say I'm now a man
And should be stading hard
But I don't think I'll make it, dear
If you don't play your part
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

Soldier boy to you
We all must do our share
And darling, I don't mind
The only thing that's greed in me is leaving you behind

Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a loving soldier boy
I'll be a faithful soldier boy
I'll be a loving soldier boy to you

// It Hurt Me Too //

I could have left and said I told you so
(Told you so)
I could have told the whole wide world and leave you sad and blue
(Sad and blue)

Said I could have left and said it's good for you, yeah now
But I know when it hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

I could have said that you had it coming to you
(Coming to you)
When you walked out and turned your back on me
(Back on me)

I played it, baby, all along, please, please baby, don't go
'Cause I knew he would hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

He said he had you dancing on a string
As far as love goes, you were just another fling
Oh, I may be a fool to love you the way I do
(Way I do)

Don't you realize even fools have feeling too
So baby, come on back
And let me dry the tears from your eyes

'Cause I would never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
No, no I'd never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
'Cause baby when he hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

It hurts me so bad
(Hurt me too)
I'd never desert you
(Hurt me too)

// Taking My Time //

Taking my time
Making up my mind
Choosin' the girl that's gonna have to love me forever
I wanna make sure
That she has a heart of gold, yeah
And a love to hold me forever, yeah

That's why I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know
If it's the kind of love that's gonna last me forever
Don't wanna waste precious time by playin' the lover's part
'Cause I may wind up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, not me (Not me)
Not me (Not me)
Not I (Not I) Oh (Not I) Not me

Do you believe
A wise man once told me a long time ago
If a woman don't love you, let her go
I don't need you, baby

That's why I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know
If it's the kind of love that's gonna last me forever
Don't wanna waste precious time by playin' the lover's part
'Cause I may wind up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, not me (Not me)
Not me (Not me)
Not I (Not I) Oh (Not I) Not me
[ad lib]

Taking my time
Makin' up my mind
Choosin', choosin'
I said I don't want an untrue lover
Choosin'... [fade]

// Hello There Angel //

Right around the corner, oooh
(There lives an angel) Angel (An angel)
And how I hope and pray
I'll make her my girl
So, if I had wings of gold
I'd fly to you, my love, yes, I would
And on my way to you
I'd catch a star from above
Straight away I'd fly to cloud number nine
See, if my baby was feelin' fine
When I get there
This is what I'd say

(Hello there angel) Hello there angel
Are you feelin' fine today
I happened to be in the neighborhood
Thought I'd fly around your way to say
Angel love (Angel love)
My darlin' angel (My darlin' angel)
Can you come out to play (Hello there angel)
Come on, angel (Hello there angel) Please

I really love you

Now right around the corner
There lives an angel (An angel)
Now if Venus only knew
Oh, how she'd envy you, yes, she would
The beauty of your love
Shines through and through
And oh, oh, without you I know
My world would come to an end
But I've got you right beside me
With each day a new dawn begins

(Hello there angel) Hello there angel
Are you feelin' fine today
I happened to be in the neighborhood
Thought I'd fly around your way to say
Angel love (Angel love)
My darlin' angel (My darlin' angel)
Can you come out to play (Hello there angel)
Come on, angel (Hello there angel) Please

Oh, walkin' with your halo on
(Hello there angel) Hello angel
(Hello there angel) Yes, darlin'
Oh, I want to take you home... [fade]
