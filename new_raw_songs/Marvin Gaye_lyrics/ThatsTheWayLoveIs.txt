Album: ThatsTheWayLoveIs

// That's The Way Love Is //

Ah baby
After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
You're left alone and broken-hearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last nobody knows

[Chorus:]
That's the way love is, baby [or honey, or other endearing term]
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (ain't got a friend)
And your whole world's cavin' in (cavin' in)
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (to be strong)
You better forget him now that he's gone (now that he's gone)
Remember...

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

Listen to me, little darlin'
The road of love is rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
I've been hurt by love so many times
I know just what you're goin' through
You wish you were never born
You better forget him now that he's gone

[Chorus]

Wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
[...and fade]

// Gonna Give Her All The Love I've Got //

There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind

And when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got

There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things you said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be

When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
Said when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got

Baby, ah baby, my little darling
I'm coming home

The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind

So when I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm gonna give her all the love I've got

// Yesterday //

Oh, yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
People I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly

Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say

I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

Oh, talkin' about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

Well I must have said something wrong
Now I long, long for yesterday

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in, I want you to know I believe in
Yester, yester, yesterday

// Groovin' //

Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

Groovin' down a crowded avenue
Doing anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can be anyone we like to be
All those happy people we could meet
Just groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

Groovin' baby

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groovin', groovin', groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
Groovin'

// I Wish It Would Rain //

Hmmm
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away.
My girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom.
So day after day, I stayed locked up in my room.
I know to you it might sound strange.
But I wish it would rain. (How I wish that it would rain)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside. (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't suppose to cry, listen.
I gotta cry 'cause cryin' eases the pain, oh yeah.
People this hurt I feel inside, words can never explain.
I just wish it would rain. (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)

Oh, let it rain.
Rain, rain, rain (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Ooo, baby. Let it rain.
(Let it rain) Oh yeah, let it rain.

[Instrumental]

Day in, day out, my tear stained face
Pressed against the window pane.
My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain.
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops.
And no one will ever know.
That I'm cryin'... cryin' when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears, I refuse to explain.
Oh, I wish it would rain. (Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Ooo, baby.

Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
Oh, yeah, yeah listen.
I'm a man and I got my pride.
Give me rain or I'm gonna stay inside.
Let it rain.

(Let it rain)
(Let it (rain) (rain) (rain) rain, rain)

// How Can I Forget //

They ask me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
But that won't be eas', you see
After all the things you've done for me
Told the men I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
'Cause without you, girl, I'm nothin' at all

[Chorus:]
How, how can I forget ya?
After all you've done for me
Oh woman, you'll always be a part of me
I, I can't forget you
It's impossible, you see
Woman, you'll always be a part of me

Girl, I'm down on my bended knees
And I'm beggin' you please, beggin' you please
Woman, woman, don't set me free
'Cause right this moment in the sun
My life was wastin' away
Girl, your love gave me hope and strength
You're the reason I'm alive today
Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the evergreens

[Repeat chorus and fade]

// Gonna Keep On Tryin' Till I Win Your Love //

(Duh-da-da-da, Duh-da-da-da, Duh-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you.
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I layed eyes on you.
I know your love belongs to someone else.
But girl, I got to have you for myself.

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
Gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.

A fallen star that's what you are, from the heavens above.
There's no treasure on earth, that can match your worth.
You're a picture of love.
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy.
But you're wrong.
I love ya and I need you, by my side.

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.

Aw, yeah.
Baby.
Keep on.

I can't help but thinkin' 'bout that guy. 
He jus' got you by his side.
He's got everything.
There's is no inch of his happiness to be in his place.
I'll be glad to give you anything.
I know your love belongs to him.
But girl, I can't be satisfied jus' being your friend.

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo.
Gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love.
Everyday, baby.
Gonna keep on trying, got to just keep on trying till I win your love.
No matter what it takes.
I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love.

// No Time For Tears //

I've got no time, no time for tears
Though you walked out on me, oh yes you did
My life must go, you see
Though our love has ended
I've got another to be friends with
Oh I'm just gonna pick up the pieces (pick up the pieces)
And start life all over again

'Cause I know cryin' won't bring you back, my love
And a word about you, baby, won't bring you back, my love
Like the wise, I realize what's done is done
Why should I cry? (Why should I cry?)
When you didn't love me anyway

I've got no time, no time, no time, no time for tears
Life holds too many joys to worry 'bout an unfaithful, unfaithful boy
Just like I loved you, there's other fellas lovable too
So I'm just gonna pick up the pieces (pick up the pieces)
And start life all over again

'Cause I've got no time, no time, no time for tears
Cryin' won't bring you back, baby

// Cloud Nine //

The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one-room shack we slept in, the children beside me
We hardly had enough food or rooms
It was a hard time
Needed somethin' to ease my troubled mind.

Ooooh listen
Father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected Mama and treated her slightly
I left home seekin' a job that I never did find
The first thing, downhearted, I took to Cloud 9

I'm doin' fine up here on Cloud 9
Listen, one more time
I'm doin' fine up here on Cloud 9

Folks now tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance
And don't let life pass you by."
But the world around you is a rat race
Where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
It ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night

I'm doin' fine on Cloud 9
Let me tell you about Cloud 9
(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) Yeah, every man, every man is free
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna say (up) higher (up up and away)
Cloud 9

I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud 9
Uh uh uh uh, I'm ridin' high on Cloud 9

You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud 9) There's no diff'rence 'tween day and night
(Cloud 9) It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna say (up) higher (up up and away)

(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be...

// Don't You Miss Me A Little Bit Baby //

I hear you're telling everybody
That you're glad I'm gone
Do you tell them how you cried
Whenever you were all alone

We both know for us
There'll never, never be another
So forget about your foolish pride
And let's get back together

Listen
Who cares who was right or wrong
I just know I need you
And by your side is where I belong

Don't you miss me a little bit baby
'Cause I'm missing you
Say you miss me a little bit baby

You think you take me back
People will call you a fool
Deep down inside you know you need me
As much as I need you

Because of your pride
You're letting two hearts suffer
Baby can't you see
You're only making things tougher

Who cares who was right or wrong
I just need you baby
'Cause by your side is where I belong

Don't you miss me a little bit baby
Please tell me that you do
Say you miss me a little bit baby

Girl, I walk these streets day and night
Alone and downhearted
Every doggone day baby
Since we've been parted

Aimlessly with no sense of direction
Baby I'm trying to tell you
I need your sweet love and affection
Yes I do (yes I do)
Can't make it without you (I need you)
Oh yeah (yes I do)

This loneliness and separation
Makes too high a price to pay
When two people love each other the way we do
Should nothing stand in their way

You're making a mountain out of a molehill
Because of your pride
You're letting a little misunderstanding
Push true love aside

Who cares who was right or wrong
Just say you want me back baby
And I come running, running back home

Don't you miss me a little bit baby

// So Long //

You got me skipping around
Thinking down
Searching all over town
Try to keep my eye on you

You got me looking here
And looking there
Got me searching everywhere
Honey, why can't you be true

From me you get sweet satisfaction
In return I get no reaction
Your love for me girl is drifting away
So you're leaving me with nothing else to say

So long
I can't take it no more
So long
I'm walking out of the door
My loving you dragging me down
I got to save my heart
Got to get out of town

So long
Honey, honey, honey I'm even
So long now I'm leaving
It's gonna hurt me baby
I know that you
Tried to forsake my heart
There is nothing else I can do

You got a lot of nerve standing there
Tear all over your face
When you know darn well
That you'd do the same thing
Baby if you were in my place
You might as well dry your eyes
'Cause we both now you don't care
So I'm playing smart, packing up my heart
Honey, I'm leaving now
So long

So long
I wasted to much time
You treat our love like a one night stand
Honey you just lost one good man
So long
So long, bye bye baby
