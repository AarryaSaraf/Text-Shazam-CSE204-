Album: HereMyDear

// Here, My Dear //

I guess I'd have to say this album is
dedicated to you.
Although perhaps you may not be happy,
this is what you want,
so I conceded.
I hope it makes you happy.
There's a lot of truth in it, babe.

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
to keep me in line.
One thing I can't do without
is the boy whom God gave to both of us.
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.

So here it is, babe.
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,
think about the kisses and the joy.
But there were those other moments too,
the times that were cloudy and grey.
Bad.
But you taught me that was life.
May love ever protect you,
may peace come into your life.
Always think of me the way I was.
Ha, I was your baby.

This is what you wanted.
Here, dear, here it is.
Here, my dear, here it is.

// I Met A Little Girl //

I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home and ahh made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think i'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you, all the heartaches you hid

Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you

Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
'Cause I love you

1964

Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you

1976

Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today, today
If you're a friend of mine

Cry cry cyr-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Dou you think about the kind of love we had?

Hal le hallelejah
Hal le lu i'm free
Hal le hallelejah
Hal le lu i'm free
[crying and fade]

// When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You //

You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean...
if you think back about what you really said, what it's all about, honor, loving and
obeying until death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should...it
should, it shouldn't be lies, because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what
you said, you've lied to God. The words should be changed.

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again, again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay? For leaving you, my fine is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I tried to love and protect you
With all my heart, long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
When I really tried, you know how hard I tried, how I really tried
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
But I can't understand, 'cause if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you best I could?
You were so divine and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years to break away to the blue-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world, good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied. No, you still want me standing by your side
Memories haunt you all the time. I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side; you've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me through
You try your best, you say I gave you no rest

[Repeat and fade:]
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?

// Anger //

Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe....

Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad

When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lof of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right

Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage

One more time-anger, more ager
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what i'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick,
children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul

I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way i'm supposed to feel

I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe

Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Anger
Anger

// Is That Enough //

Whoa, I was a fool from the start
Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean
Oh but you didn't know that, I didn't know that
You didn't know what I mean

You know you had a brother who thought he was cool
But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
and stay beside me night and day 
You said you would love and obey
Well you should, well you should
It can only get you good

I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
but I'll never get enough get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again

You always knew that I
wasn't that kind of guy
All the times I thought you knew
well I was busy loving you
What was you afraid to lose
Everybody's got to choose

I don't know if I'm gonna get a yeah or neh
or if I'm gonna do what his honor says

(Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous
Too possessive, jealous 
She was too possessive, jealous)

But if I decide, baby, what you want
I wanna know
if you would be satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Would you be satisfied
Satisfied

Is that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy
Is that enough
You know I do it
and I know that you just love 
that expensive stuff

You got a flair for style
and the style is all the while
What could I do
The judge said she got to keep on living
the way she accustomed to
She trying to break a man
I don't understand
Somebody tell me please, tell me please
Why do I have to pay attorney fees (My baby's)
Attorney fees (Ooh baby)
This is a joke
I need a smoke
Wait a minute

// Everybody Needs Love //

See those flowers, they need love
see the bluebirds, they need love
see the babies, they need love
all God's children, oh need love

see your mother, she needs love
and my father, he needs love
that's true baby, and I need love too

see those rain drop, rivers they need love
and the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
don't find good love every day, we ought to think
before we throw good love away

doesn't matter, what you are
a thief or a beggar or even a superstar
as long as you were made by God above
oh, I know, I know, you need love, we need love

baby, oh, I need love, I need your love, 
(I'm standing here), oh baby standing in the need of love, I need love
I need it, I got to have it baby
oh can't you see that I'm standing in the need

I'm still here cause I need love
I'm still with you dear
cause I need your love
and I know, oh yes I know
though you feel you don't need loving,
you still need loving too, oh yes you do

it don't matter no, it doesn't matter what you are
a thief or a beggar or a superstar
as long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know
you were made for love (cause love is what you need and understanding) oh, understanding

you were made for love, 
sweet understanding why can't we see we were made for love
you were made for love baby, sweet understanding, 
why can't we see, we (you) were made for love 
(why is it so hard for us today to see the real) 
we were made from love, you were made of love baby you were made to love baby

what's the only thing that's gonna get us together (love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright) what is this we're singing about for the love of Jesus, let's do it

I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love

it's a fact,
(who) even the slimy seal needs love
(who) all of the folks in jail need love
(who) even a mean old man needs love

// Time To Get It Together //

Time...Time...
Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
Time...Time...Time...Time
But we have to live right to get the time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Please, Time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
I let temptation get me off of my groove
Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind, yeah
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Pretty good lovin', oh
Get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right -- good lovin', oh
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right -- good love
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right, baby
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right

(Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock --
My life's a clock and it's winding down)

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight ho's
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight ho's
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground
