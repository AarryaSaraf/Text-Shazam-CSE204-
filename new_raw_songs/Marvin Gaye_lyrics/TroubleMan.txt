Poor Abbey Walsh
Poor... who
Chalky just washed him away
And they're gonna put the blame
On Mr. T

// Trouble Man //

I come up hard, baby
But now I'm cool
I didn't make it, sugar
Playin' by the rules

I come up hard, baby
But now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sugar
Movin' down the line

I come up hard, baby
But that's okay, cause
Trouble man
Don't get in the way

I come up hard, baby
I'm in for real, baby
Gonna keep movin'
Gonna go to town

I come up hard
I come up, gettin' down
There's only three things 
That's for sho'
Taxes, death and trouble, h'oh!

This I know, man, is
This I know, sugar
Girl, ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby 

Got me singin'
Yeah! Yea-aah!
Hoo-ooo-ooo

Come up hard, baby
I had to fight
Took care of my business
Wit' all my might

I come up hard, awful hard
I had to win
Then start all over 
And win again

I come up hard
But that's okay, 'cause
Trouble man
Don't get in my way
Hey, hey!

I know some places
And I see some faces
I've got the connections
I dig my directions
What people say, that's okay
They don't bother me, oh yeah

I'm ready to make it
Don't care what the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble
Got myself together
I feel the kind of protection
That's all around me

I come up hard, baby
I be for real, baby
With a trouble minds
Movin', goin' to town

I come up hard
I come up, gettin' down
There's only three things fo' sho'
Taxes, death and trouble

Ooh, this I've known, baby, ooo!
This I've known, baby
Ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby
Woo!

"I'm on the ground, yeah, yeah!"

Woo, I come up hard
But now I've cooled
I didn't make it, baby
Playin' by the rules

Come up hard, baby
Now, I'm fine, I've 
Checkin' trouble, sugar
Hey, movin' down the line 
Oooh.

// Life Is A Gamble //

Life is a gamble, oh, oh baby
Where you win or lose
I'm right, just paid my dues

// Don't Mess With Mister "T" //

Oh, Chalky!
Don't mess with Mister "T"
Oh, yeah!
You know he means you no harm
But you know you know, you're doing him wrong
Please, Chalky
Don't mess with Mister "T"
Ow!
Don't do it, don't do it!
Please, Chalky
Don't mess with Mister "T"
No
Take my advice, Chalky
Don't fool around with "T"

// There Goes Mister "T" //

"T" stands for trouble
Oh, baby
Trouble man
Trouble man
