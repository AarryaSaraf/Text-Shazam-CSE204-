// Restless Highway //

I am a travelling man, I have no country
And travelling people are my kin by birth
No chains will keep me from my destination
And far flung are my footsteps on this earth

There's something in my mind that makes me
Something in the wind that takes me
Like the dust, I'm blown out on the street again

Restless highway
I need to leave this town behind
Restless highway
Some sweeter country on my mind
You'll hear my footsteps
Wherever this rocky road will wind
This empty restless highway is my home

By way of trade I'm anything you fancy
I'll solder pots or milk your gurning cow
I'll shine your shoes or sew your silver buttons
I'll blunt your nose or sharpen up your plough

There's something in my mind that makes me
Something in the wind that takes me
Like the dust, I'm blown out on the street again

Restless highway
I need to leave this town behind
Restless highway
Some sweeter country on my mind
You'll hear my footsteps
Wherever this rocky road will wind
This empty restless highway is my home
Oh, this empty restless highway is my home

// Sweet Surrender //

I gave my heart to you
Oh oh oh oh
I gave my heart to you
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

I'd give the world for you
Oh oh oh oh
I'd give the world for you
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

You make me weak, when you touch my hand
Oh I should run from here but I can't seem to stand
Oh I can't leave you, oh I believe you
And I believe you understand

I feel you next to me
Oh oh oh oh
I feel you next to me
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

Oh I can't leave you, oh I believe you
And I believe you understand

You make my heart beat
Oh oh oh oh
You make my heart beat
Oh oh oh with sweet surrender
Sweet surrender, oh sweet surrender
Allah, Allah, Allah

Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender
Sweet, sweet surrender

// Died For Love //

I'm wishing and waiting
Down on the shoreline
Oh tell me, lover
When will you be mine
Sail my ship on the ocean
I'll sail to some far place
And I'll inquire of every captain
Oh have you seen her face?
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love

Trouble and worry
Why should it mess up your mind
It's nothing, it's just shadows
That you will leave behind
What is my life without trouble
If I'm away from you
Oh I will love you forever
Till you love me and I love you
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love

Well true love, the real thing
It don't come easy
And giving and searching
It don't come easy
Of all the flowers in the forest
Of all the birds in the air
Of all the jewels and treasures
Oh how can they compare
I'd give my life to be with you

And if they ask about me
And if they ask about me
Oh say that I died
I died for love
Say that I died
I died for love
And say that I died
I died for love

// Strange Affair //

This is a strange affair
The time has come to travel but the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair
My youth has all been wasted and I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me against my dying day
I took my own provision, but it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, and taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, and called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had that's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow
You'll win the lover's prize
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

// Layla //

I drew near to the house of Layla
It was then I heard her call
Her sweet voice made me wish that it would never end at all
Oh you say you see some good in me
It's only from her light
Take this being gone from me, don't look to her delight
She was pleased with me, she drew me nearer
She took me into her retreat
Oh she kept my company, she spoke to me
She let me sit at her feet
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla

And then she came close to me, the veils fell from my sight
She dazzled me, she bewildered me
Confused me with her light
Well you say you see some good in me, it's only from her light
Take this being gone from me
Don't look to her delight
And then she took me, and then she possessed me
She showed her meaning to me
I thought my soul would be her ransom
I thought that she was me
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla

And then she slew me, she tore me to pieces
Her blood stained like a die
And when I was dead, she brought me to life
My star shone in her sky
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Layla Layla Layla Layla
Oh Layla Layla Layla Layla

// Pavanne //

Pavanne, cold steel woman Pavanne
How do you love a woman
With eyes cold as the barrel of her gun
Who's never missed her mark on anyone
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne

Casino doors swing open, the rich men raise their eyes
They say who is this beauty as elegant as ice
And later there's an accident, another charge d'affair
Is lying in a pool of blood, no witness anywhere
And they say she was a hundred miles away
The hotel porter saw her climb the stairs
And the maid with trembling hands knows what to say
When the judge says "Are you sure," "I'm sure" she swears

Pavanne, cold steel woman Pavanne
How do you love a woman
With eyes cold as the barrel of her gun
Who's never missed her mark on anyone
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne

At the presidential palace a thousand people saw
His excellency leave his car and never make the door
The blood flows from his fingers as he clutches at the stain
He staggers like a drunken man, lies twisted in the rain
And they say she grew up well provided for
Her mother used to keep her boys for sure
And father's close attentions led to talk
She learned to stab her food with a silver fork

Pavanne, cold steel woman Pavanne

And they say she didn't do it for the money
And they say she didn't do it for a man
They say that she did it for the pleasure
The pleasure of the moment

Pavanne, cold steel woman Pavanne
How do you stop this woman
When everyone is moving in a trance
Like prisoners of some slow, courtly dance
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne

// House Of Cards //

Oh the rain is falling (blow blow down)
And the wild wind roars (blow blow down)
It'll shake your windows (blow blow down)
And rattle your doors (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

They're washing the streets (blow blow down)
With the blood of your kind (blow blow down)
Ah look over your shoulder (blow blow down)
They are right behind (blow blow down)
Oh blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

The birds are wheeling (blow blow down)
Up above your head (blow blow down)
Ah your days are numbered (blow blow down)
You're as good as dead (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

This very fine house (blow blow down)
Of great renown (blow blow down)
It's cracked and shaking (blow blow down)
And a-tumbling down (blow blow down)
Ah blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Oh blow down this house of cards

// First Light //

Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
First light, first light

I came to you for refuge
Don't leave me to the thieves
Don't leave me to my own
Cure my disease
First light, first light
First light, first light

Take me through the mountains
Lead me from confusion
Take me by the hand
Through real and through illusion
First light, first light
First light, first light

Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
Give me what I ask for
Give me what I long for
First light, first light
First light, first light
First light, oh give me what I ask for
First light, give me what I long for
First light, oh give me what I ask for
First light, oh give me what I long for
