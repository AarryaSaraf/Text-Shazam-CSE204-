// Tear Stained Letter //

It was three in the morning when she took me apart
She wrecked the furniture, she wrecked my heart
She danced on my head like Arthur Murray
The scars ain't never going to mend in a hurry

Just when I thought I could learn to forget her
Right through the door come a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

Well my head was beating like a song by the Clash
It was writing cheques that my body couldn't cash
Got to my feet, I was reeling and dizzy
I went for the 'phone but the line was busy

Just when I thought that things would get better
Right through the door come a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

Well I like coffee and I like tea
But I just don't like this fiddle-di-dee
It makes me nervous, it gives me the hives
Waiting for a kiss from a bunch of fives

Just when I think I could learn to forget her
Right through the door come a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

// How I Wanted To //

When we parted just like friends
We never tied loose ends
I could never say the words that would make amends

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
To say I loved you
To say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

From my blue room did you creep
A love too rare to keep
Well I heard your step and I turned my head to weep

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Now hearts do what hearts will
And my nights are sleepless still
Well I never was the one to speak my fill

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Just say I loved you
Ah just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

Oh how I wanted to
Oh how I wanted to
Say I loved you
Just say I loved you
Oh how I wanted to

// Both Ends Burning //

Well I bought me a horse with a broken leg
They said that she never could win
Only fit for a bullet, they said
She'll be coming out of a tin

So I took her home, I fed her on hay
I tied her up with a sling
Well, she just kept howling all of the night
And that's the reason I sing

Well, both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

I took her to the race-track one fine day
They couldn't believe their eyes
They said, if that nag even stays on her feet
We're going to give you first prize

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

O both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

She ran so fast that it took my breath
You never did see such a win
But when she crossed that finishing line
I was just too tired to grin

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

O both ends burning, both ends burning
That's how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

// A Poisoned Heart And A Twisted Memory //

O you took my word and you took my key
You took my pride and you took my dignity
How can I still pretend
To be what a man should be

Well, whatever I say is in a book
Whatever I do there's someone there to look
You just can't shake a man
The way that I've been shook

Now is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

O see that lifer doing his time
If I could have his place and he'd have mine
We'd be no better off
On either side of the line

Well, you took my job and you put me to sleep
You feed me money, you treat me like a creep
Wish I could get away
But I must be in it too deep

Tell me is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

Well, you tell me you're going to get in touch
You send me a letter that reads like double-Dutch
You say, you're bound to lose
You're a little such-and-such

You got my number, you got my rank
You drained my head, you drained my petrol tank
And when I die of shame
I won't even know who to thank

Now, now, is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

// Where The Wind Don't Whine //

Get in the car she said and drive me into next week
I should have turned her down, blame my curious streak
I never dreamt that we'd be driving into trouble
Until we hit a rock that bent my nose double

I'd say we both were on run, run, run
She looked too fresh for twenty-one, one, one
She slipped her little hand in mine, mine, mine
Said I'll take you where the wind don't whine, whine
I'll take you where the wind don't whine

Ah the wheels were moaning, we were heading ninety-five
The rain was beating down, my engine was alive
The roads were empty as the day turned into night
With every street lamp her face shone white

I asked her name and she just smiled, smiled, smiled
We must have clocked a thousand miles, miles, miles
She said we'll be there in a while, while, while
I'll take you where the wind don't whine, whine
I'll take you where the wind don't whine

I was feeling weary when the car died on me
I pulled her over and the strength just drained from me
The price of running's getting dearer and dearer
And nothing ever seems to get nearer and nearer

I suppose I didn't make the grade, grade, grade
When I looked around she'd slipped away, 'way, 'way
Out in the night you'll see her shine, shine, shine
Waiting where the wind don't whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don't whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don't whine

// The Wrong Heartbeat //

Don't think my love is something that you can play with
I'm not the one to spend the time of day with
You learn to hide love, you lock it up or find it gone
You think you need me, you think you read me
From the beating of my heart

But you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

If you should see a tear, you won't see many
If you should hear me sigh, it's not for any
If you should greet me as I am walking along
You only want to see just the shell of me
You don't know the other part

Well, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
I said, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

Don't throw your secrets where men will steal them
You got to hide them, you got to seal them
No matter what you try, you'll never take my love from me
And if you might think that you can move me
From the beating of my heart

O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Ah, listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

O yes you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

You're, you're, you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
O listening to the wrong heartbeat
O you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

// The Hand Of Kindness //

Well I wove the rope and I picked the spot
Well I struck out my neck and I tightened the knot
O, stranger stranger, I'm near out of time
You stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

O maybe just a hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

Well, I scuppered the ship and I bent the rail
Well, I cut the brakes and I ripped the sail
And they called me a Jonah, it's a sin I survived
And you stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

Maybe just a hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

O shoot that old horse and break in the new
O the hung are many and the living are few
I see your intention, there's my neck on the line
You stretch out your hand, I stretch out mine

Well, maybe just a hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand
Stranger, will you reach me in time? In time?

O maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just a hand
Stranger will you reach me in time? In time?

// Devonside //

By Devonside she was a-marching
It was a gang of no great size
And surrender was the banner that she carried
And hungry was the shiver in her eyes

She met a boy, his health was failing
She dropped the banner and took her prize
And the only food she had was bread and morphine
Ah, but he fed on the shiver in her eyes

By Devonside his love was drifting
He looked for comfort otherwise
And there never was a rope or chain about him
Ah, she held him with the shiver in her eyes

Ah, she said, my John, I'll be your pillow
I'll be your lover, mother, whore and wife
And he knew that he loved and never seen her
When the light fell from the shiver in her eyes

// Two Left Feet //

O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

Well, your hair is pretty and your face is a treat
But I don't like your two left feet
I'm not one to admit defeat
But I can't win with your two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
But I can't stand them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

Well, they're pulling people in off the street
They all want to look at your two left feet
Dance with Jimmy, dance with Pete
Don't dance with me with them two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet o

I dance with you and I land on my seat
That's 'cause you dance with two left feet
You could make my life complete
Just get rid of them two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet

O two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet
Two left feet, two left feet
How can you dance with two left feet

I love you honey, you're so sweet
Just get rid of them two left feet
You got no style, you got no beat
All you've got is them two left feet
