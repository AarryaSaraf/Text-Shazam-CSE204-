// Never Again //

Oh, who will remember? Oh, who will be sure?
And still feel the silence as close as before
And was there a season without any rain?
Ah never, oh never, oh never again

The time for dividing and no one will speak
Of the sadness of hiding and the softness of sleep
Oh will there be nothing of peace till the end?
Oh never, oh never, oh never again

Old man how you tarry, old man how you weep
The trinkets you carry and the garlands you keep
For the salt-tears of lovers and the whispers of friends
Come never, oh never, oh never again
