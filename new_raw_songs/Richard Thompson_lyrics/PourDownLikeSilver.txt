Album: PourDownLikeSilver

// Streets Of Paradise //

The tears fall down like whisky
The tears fall down like wine
On an island made of cocaine
In a sea of turpentine
We all need some assistance
But won't that day be fine
When we're walking down the streets of Paradise

Tar brush on the corner
I've never seen him before
He drank ten fingers of what they had
Now his feet don't touch the floor
He can't see me or this dirty old town
He's got nothing to look for
He's walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise

I'd trade my silver mansion
With a guard on every door
I'd trade my wealth and treasure
And the sash my father wore
I'd trade my little sister
And my brother who went before
To be walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise

I asked you for a racehorse
Now don't hand me no mule
I asked you for a fast car
Don't you take me for a fool
Just hand me down my telescope
And a bullet I can chew
I'll be walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise
Walking down the streets of Paradise

// The Poor Boy Is Taken Away //

Called him poor boy, you took him for fun
He dressed for the tinkering trade
He dressed for the tinkering trade
Now the poor boy is taken away

No use waiting like a ghost in a dream
The world has no comfort to bring
The world has no comfort to bring
He left you, took everything

No use standing, waving adieu
The penny won't drop in your mind
The penny won't drop in your mind
The old flame has left you behind

No use crying in a room full of memories
You never will find yesterday
You never will find yesterday
And the poor boy is taken away

// Night Comes In //

Night comes in like some cool river
How can there be, be another day?
Take my hand, oh, real companion
And we'll dance, we'll dance till we fade away

Oh, the songs pour down like silver
They can only, only break my heart
Drink the wine, the wine of lovers
Lovers tired of being apart

Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

Oh, this night is like no other
And this room is ringing in my ears
And these friends will never leave me
And these tears are like no other tears

Dancing till my feet don't touch the ground
I lose my mind and dance forever
Lose my mind and dance forever
Turn my world around
Turn my world around

Well, I may find that street tomorrow
Leave the shadow of my lonely room
See my one, my one and only
Heart and soul, I'm coming soon

// Jet Plane In A Rocking Chair //

Jet plane in a rocking chair
Roller coaster roll nowhere
Deaf and dumb old dancing bear
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Sea cruise in a diving bell
Run a mile in a wishing well
Soft soap and nothing to sell
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Here comes the real thing
I've been waiting for so long, for so long
I've been looking for a love like you

Crossed-line on the telephone
Crossed eyes and a canny moan
Cross fingers and head for home
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Play sick in a feather bed
Act cool when you're stony dead
I'm a fool with a size one head
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time

Here comes the real thing
I've been waiting for so long, for so long
I've been looking for a love like you

Jet plane in a rocking chair
Roller coaster roll nowhere
Deaf and dumb old dancing bear
I'll change this heart of mine
This time, this time
This time, this time
This time, this time

// Hard Luck Stories //

They say running into you is like running into trouble
You bend my ear and I see double
You're everybody's idea of a waste of time

You still come around 'cause I used to listen
But I run a steamship, I don' run a mission
Don't be mistaken in thinking you're a friend of mine

Those hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind
Hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind

Well, the boss won't give you change of a penny
Everybody's got money but you haven't any
If I cared about you, I'd say it was a crying shame

Your wife ran away, she left you on Sunday
She cried when she left you, she was laughing on Monday
She should have known better and never gone and changed her name

Those hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind
Hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind

Why don't you grow up? Why don't you settle down?
Why don't you get a job? Why don't you leave town?
Even a chicken has to do what it has to do

You don't like one thing, you don't like another
You don't like anything that looks like bother
Everyone don't like something and we all don't like you

Those hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind
Hard luck stories, it's all I ever get from you
Hard luck stories, you're going to drive me out of my mind

// Dimming Of The Day //

This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in the river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day

// The Dark End Of The Street //

At the dark end of the street
That's where we'd always meet
Just in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong

You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know that time's gonna take its toll
We've got to give back all the love that we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong

You and me at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're going to find us
They're going to find us
They're going to find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me

If you take a walk downtown
If you should see me just walk on by
Oh, darling, please, don't cry

Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're going to find us
They're going to find us
They're going to find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me
You and me
