// Put Your Trust In Me //

Oh my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet
And the whole world's lying here at my feet
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I rub my eyes and I catch my breath
I'm almost choking on the smell of success
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I get careless now and then
But I won't let you down again

I got x-ray eyes and with just one look
I can read your future like an open book
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

I get careless now and then
But I won't let you down again

Oh my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet
And the whole world's lying here at my feet
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me

Put your trust in me

Put your trust in me

// Boomtown //

Well I'm a poor boy from Wabash, they call me oil trash
I've rubber-necked and rousted around
And every damn job the boss he says "Hoss
It ain't worth pumping from the ground"

So I come here to Boomtown doing just fine
Till the shit hits the fan, alright
Now I can't get no pay and I'm wasting away
Flushed out and busted in Boomtown tonight

My baby she's mad, she thinks I'm all bad
She'd like to see me work myself to death
She said "Go out and get yourself another damn job"
I said "Honey, just save your breath"

Oh that sweet little thing, she threw back my ring
I bet she held it up to the light
Now the kids are all yakking, my baby she's packing
Flushed out and busted in Boomtown tonight

Oh Boomtown is busted, the rigs are all rusted
There's no lights on my Christmas tree
Well I tried El Paso and I tried Amarillo
But I didn't find a drop of Texas tea

Well they hit us when we're down, and we can't get up
Though we're trying with all of our might
Now the bottle's run dry and I'm wondering why
Flushed out and busted in Boomtown tonight
Yes I'm flushed out and busted in Boomtown tonight

// To Hang A Dream On //

Someone knocking at your front door
Could be the one you're looking for
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

I might be the one, I just might be
You might be waiting for the likes of me
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

Romance is a peach, you can't resist her
Even if you try, don't forget it mister
She'll get under you skin
And you won't care why

Santa Claus or Captain Cook
Everyone looking for the same old hook
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

This is my life, my whole career
Selling my soul for a good idea
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

This old town's been down so long
Looks to me like it needs someone
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

Romance is a peach, you can't resist her
Even if you try, don't forget it mister
She'll get under you skin
And you won't care why

Someone knocking at your front door
Could be the one you're looking for
To hang a dream on, to hang a dream on

// False Or True //

I tell you secrets that don't even matter
I give you keepsakes but only to flatter
I don't believe in myself, I don't believe in myself
So why should anyone else

Will I be a thief for love
Soon or never, ever false or true

New tricks for old dogs, no sleight, no deceiving
I wish I were someone that you could believe in
I don't believe in myself, oh I don't believe in myself
So why should anyone else

Will I be a thief for love
Soon or never, ever false or true
False or true
