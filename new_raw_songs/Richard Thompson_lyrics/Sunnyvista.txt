// Civilisation //

They're not human, they're with the Woolwich
They eat food I wouldn't give to my dog
They're hygienic, medicated
They wouldn't live next door to no wog
They're not human, where do they come from?
I don't know what they're living here for
They don't belong here, on this planet
What are they doing in the house next door?

Wife's tranquilized, milk's pasteurized
Kid's hypnotized by the TV
Dad'll beat you, dog'll eat you
They'll treat you like family

All across the nation
It's civilization

They're not human, they've got a new car
They're going to polish it all the day long
Got a brand new rubber woman
They're going to blow her up all the night long
They're not human, it's a double cross
They sold out for a handful of beads
They sold everything for nothing, just a
Headful of dreams and a handful of greed

Keep 'em happy, keep 'em drinking
Keep 'em laughing, no thinking
No dying, no weeping
Keep 'em hypnotized, keep 'em sleeping

All across the nation
It's civilization

Pack you off to school, get working
Get a steady job, no shirking
Get to sixty-five, get a handshake
You're a vegetable with a heartache

All across the nation
It's civilization

// Borrowed Time //

There's riders in this county
They're taking heads for bounty
Wake up Corinne, they come to ride us down
Sweetness we have tasted
The time to move is wasted
They're riding like a hurricane through this town

We've been too many nights sleeping in a feather bed
You can't close both your eyes with a price on your head
You got to stand and fight for what you believe
You got to face death with your heart on your sleeve
Life is a card-game, you've soon got to leave

Living on borrowed, living on borrowed, living on borrowed time

If you say that you want your freedom
They'll hear you in every kingdom
They'll travel ten thousand miles just to shoot you down
Well the judge he was deluded
And the sheriff he soon colluded
And they swore they'd hang me six feet off the ground

They'll hunt you down 'cause you dare to tell the truth
A man ain't safe these days under his own roof
But you can't live your life under no man's thumb
They'll all pay double for what they've done
Our day's coming but their day's come

Living on borrowed, living on borrowed, living on borrowed time

You can't live your life under no man's thumb
They'll all pay double for what they've done
Our day's coming but their day's come

Living on borrowed, living on borrowed, living on borrowed time

// Saturday Rolling Around //

Wind's gonna blow my blues away
Wind's gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna throw my shoes away
Saturday rolling around

Moon going down and the sun come up
Moon going down and the sun come up
We're gonna drink from a loving cup
Saturday rolling around

Been too long working for the man
He just don't like my face
Been too long looking for a dream
And looking in the wrong place

Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a ship and slide away
Saturday rolling around

I ain't gonna punch that clock no more
I ain't gonna punch that clock no more
I'm going home gonna lock the door
Saturday rolling around

Working all week from nine to five
Working all week from nine to five
Gonna get down gonna do the jive
Saturday rolling around

Been all week, work so hard
Sweat pour off my face
Saturday night we're gonna get down
And really rock that place

We're going down to Fontaineau
We're going down to Fontaineau
We're gonna dance at the Fais do-do
Saturday rolling around

Wind's gonna blow my blues away
Wind's gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna throw my shoes away
Saturday rolling around

Moon going down and the sun come up
Moon going down and the sun come up
We're gonna drink from a loving cup
Saturday rolling around

Been too long working for the man
He just don't like my face
Been too long looking for a dream
And looking in the wrong place

Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a train and ride away
Gonna take a ship and slide away
Saturday rolling around

// You're Going To Need Somebody //

When you're lost in the dark and you can't find a way
When the night is so long you don't remember the day
When you're too far gone to hear anybody call
When your last deal left you with nothing at all

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody loves you, nobody feeds you
When your ship is sinking in the middle of a sea
When they locked you in chains and they've thrown away the key

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When you don't live long unless you're fast on your feet
When they're taking your furniture right out into the street
When you can't sleep at night for counting cracks on the wall
When your friends build you up just to watch you fall

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

When you're lost in the dark and you can't find a way
When the night is so long you don't remember the day
When you're too far gone to hear anybody call
When your last deal left you with nothing at all

You're going to need somebody, you're going to need somebody
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you
You're going to need the one who was standing and waiting for you

// Why Do You Turn Your Back? //

When you were helpless, before you knew
He gave you shelter until you grew
He kept you secret, then he gave you a name
You drank from a river, you slept in the hay

You grew up running, into the wind
You grew up fighting a war you'd never win
Against a foe you'd never seen
Pretending to be what you'd never been

Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
Why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
The only one who ever really cared
The only one who ever really cared

When you were burning, the sky would pour
When you were drowning, he threw you ashore
He saved your life, o just to be
The one who turned back his enemy

And now you're like a bolted door
No-one can change the lock, your palace is secure
You're the king and the prisoner
But don't you hear the knocking at the door?

Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
Why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
The only one who ever really cared
The only one who ever really cared

And now you falter, afraid to live
And now you hold back, afraid to be the giver
And do you ever think
Of the friend who gave you gifts like a river?

Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
Why do you turn your back on the one who loves you?
Why do you turn your back on your best friend?
The only one who ever really cared
The only one who ever really cared
Why do you turn your back on your best friend?

We'll dance the happy hours away

// Lonely Hearts //

We may never meet in the light of day
If we passed on the street, would we look the other way
So I search for you where we can't be seen
And I know we'll meet on the page of this magazine

Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
We call to each other as we drown in the city
Oh why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?

It's a mean old town, can't show your heart
If you stand up and say what you mean they tear you apart
And they call it love, sell it by the pound
But the lovers are gone or they're living down underground

Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
Call to each other as we drown in the city
Oh why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?

No-one needs a friend, no one cares no more
They'll look hard at you but they won't take the chain off the door
O they work and slave, keep their conscience clean
They come home at night and they talk to an empty screen

Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
Call to each other as we drown in the city
Oh why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?

Two lonely hearts, two lonely hearts
Two lonely hearts, two lonely hearts
Call to each other as we drown in the city
Oh why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?

// Sisters //

Remember the time when we two kin were reared
There was never a morsel but that it was shared
If the one babe was stung, t'was the other would cry
There scarce was a crossed word and never a lie

Our people were drab and defeated like slaves
The light of their fathers went into the graves
I took to the highway to find some relief
I never meant parting to put you to grief

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart

Now you smile when you greet me, you put on a show
But it's slander you're talking as soon as you go
If your eye and my eye don't meet anymore
Hold fast to your tongue when I've walked out the door

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart

You say that I'm different, don't hold me to blame
It's not to my grandeur, it's not to your shame
It's nothing of mine that I lay at your door
So take it or leave it, it's to heal not to sore

Sisters
We were sisters
'Til love came between us and pulled us apart
We were sisters
We were sisters
Don't call me your sister and put a knife through my heart

// Justice In The Streets //

There's sickness in this land
Hearts have turned to sand
Crushed with an iron hand
There's justice in the streets

They fooled you for so long
You can't tell right from wrong
They are weak and you are strong
There's justice in the streets

Sometimes it seems a man can't hold his head up
To be just what he is he feels ashamed
They take away his dignity and freedom
But they can never take away the flame

Tired of living in shame
Tired of a ball and chain
Run them down like a train
There's justice in the streets

They've got you chained to a wheel
'Til you don't know how to feel
'Til you can't tell what's real
There's justice in the streets

How can you fight a man without a shadow
How can you fight a face you've never seen
A drop of rain will run into a river
Oh see the river wash the valley clean

// Traces Of My Love //

The songbird sings so clear
Like your voice upon my ear
I seem to hear traces of my love

The river rushes down
There's sweetness in the sound
I seem to hear traces of my love

When I lay on my bed
I find no rest, instead I seem to see
You here with me
Oh will that sweet day ever be
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love

In every crowded place
In every stranger's face
I seem to see traces of my love

Inside my darkest day
When the world seems cold and grey
I seem to see traces of my love

If I try to turn my head
Or close my eyes
Instead I see you there
Oh everywhere
Shadows of a face so rare
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love

If I try to turn my head
Or close my eyes
Instead I see you there
Oh everywhere
Shadows of a face so rare
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love
