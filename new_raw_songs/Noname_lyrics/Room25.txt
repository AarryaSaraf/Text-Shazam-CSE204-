Album: Room25

// Self //

Maybe this the album you listen to in your car when you driving home late at night
Really questioning every god, religion, Kanye, bitches
Maybe this is the interest before you get to the river
I had him before the heathen no reason for you to like me
Maybe this your wifey just wanting a clean divorce
The baby ain't really yours
That's really for babies teething, the chicken wings under-seasoned
Y'all really thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
Maybe this your answer for that, the crack era, the Reagan administration?
And niggas are still scared of, nah actually this is for me
This one for TT at the lake serving the mac and the cheese
This one a small apology for all the calls that I screened

Mr. money man, Mr. every day he got me
Mr. wifing me down, Mr. me love, Mr. Miyagi
Miscellaneous, Mr. molly inside my saki
Incredible, incredible emptiness in my body
Heaven's only four-feet tall, I set my ringer to it
Fucked your rapper homie now his ass is making better music
My pussy teaching ninth-grade English
My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism
In conversation with a marginal system in love with Jesus
And y'all still thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
Maybe this your answer for that
Good pussy, I know niggas only talk about money and good pussy

// Blaxploitation //

"What happened to my hundred dollars Joe?
Nigga, did you take my money?"
[Joe Blow, The Loverman:] 
"Heh-heh, that's right lil bitch!"

Penny proud, penny petty, pissing off Betty the Boop
Only the niggas that hoop, traded my life for cartoon
Dance monkey dance, cathedral gon pay me good tonight
Eating Chic-Fil-A in the shadows, that taste like hypocrite
Mmm, yummy tasty, mmm, mmm, yummy tasty
Offer for my empathy, bitches just really lazy
Maybe I'm a hypocrite, maybe I'm hypochondriac
I'm struggling to simmer down, maybe I'm an insomni-black
Bad sleep triggered by bad government
Put a think piece in a rap song the new age covet it
If you really think I'm cooking crack, then pass me the oven mitts
Captain watch a lil bitch, she go crunch and wonder how everything happen

"My people started running a long time ago and they are still fighting
Revolution was never meant to be easy
This is not your fight, black man
What is this to you?
Its not a matter of color
Freedom is everybody's business"

Anti-political mythical in the picture
Your nigga just moved to Wicker
Your mammy stay on the south side
She paid to clean your house, power of Pinesol, baby
She the scrub tub lady
She that naked bitch in videos, that drunk club lady
Immortalize all the 80's
And then she real, real nasty
You thought with all her purses she be real, real blacky
Just like a Hillary Clinton, who masqueraded the system
Who chicken-boned, watermelon-ed
Traded hoodie for hipster
Infatuated the menstrual
When we cool, they cool
We die, it's coon
We supa fly indigenous, now hop to the moon
Who brought the movie to America?
It's still coming soon

"Do you hear me man?
Do you understand? I am Black
I'm a nigga, do you understand me?
I was born black, I live black, 
and I'mma die probably because I'm black, 
because some cracker that knows 
I'm black better than you, nigga, 
is probably gonna put a bullet in the back of my head"

// Prayer Song //

If you wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me later
Gentrify all my people, there's heaviness on the table
If you wanna help me to put me inside the cusp
Put the cigarette inside my back
Keep the hospitals over run-run-run-run chicken little
How my city gonna run off shits and giggles?
Politicians overzealous with the provolone
[?] and incidentals, they crashed the rental with God and temple, and bible
Don't nobody got no holy
Everybody got an iPhone
If wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me good-good-good tonight
Inglewood tonight
LA be bright but still a dark city
So come get your happy and your new titties
Go find your doctor, you can get Kimmy sorta how we used to love you

[Adam Ness:]
America the great
It's Grateful Dead and life for me
Apple pie on Sunday morning
Obesity and heart disease
Can you hear the freedom bells?
Can you see the rusty nails chipping away out on the coffin?
Approach with caution, hallelujah, amen, amen
I was lost but thinking I was truly free (amen, amen)
Darkness lingers in the wake of slavery (amen, amen)
Hold me close, don't let me fall into the deep (amen, amen)
The lost have risen, a new religion, hallelujah, amen, amen

Demons behind your back will call you crack bitch
I seen myself all on the dash, could've sworn it's a gun
I ain't seen a toddler in the back after firing seven shots
A demon about to get me, he watching me kill his mom
[?] is overflooded, these niggas is on the rise
Bake a cake with flour its battered and gentrified
Why oh why my dick getting bigger
This violence turn me on me on
My mama finally see my baby on Channel 2
She love me better when I be keeping them streets clean
Why oh why my house getting bigger, corruption
Turn me on
Ain't no police locking up these niggas better than me
And my wife think I look like a man, I feel manly
And I tell Stanley, when you grow be like you dad
A free man in the land of the noose
They ain't tell me how to crouch and shoot
I did, they only told me how to check her pulse, she dead
When I win it's like confessional, trying to find me a therapist
They taught me how to say amen
Amen

[Adam Ness:]
America the great

Darkness lingers in the wake of slavery (amen, amen)
Hold me close, don't let me fall into the deep (amen, amen)

// Window //

Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me

Here with him a little ways from now, empty
Everything we ever was was empty
Empty fucking, cussing, I know I'm your bitch
Be on my bitch too making money little TM
DM your resume to industry
Sympathy held you down, don't doubt, we love you
Ain't nobody around, ask away like I'm empty
Empathy was empathy only when you was into me
Kiss me back to save your happy, happy
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
Laffy taffy, daffy ducky, fucky all around
Fuck me on the ground, fuck me in the bed too
Skip, love me with your eyes closed, cigarette, cruise ship
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
This song gon make me fuck your daddy
This song the reason I be claiming 'fore I send him the addy
This like a remedy for nothing, this me frenchin' a tabby

Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me
Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me

[Phoelix:]
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth

I know you never love me but I fucked you anyway
I guess a bitch like to gamble, I guess a bitch like to lonely
Who niggas? No me, me, God atone me
Oh I'm really feeling like I made this bitch
I know that's my ego, I know I'm just empty the sentiment for the people
The sacrifice for my hoes, I'm gonna rob the church for the steeple
I bought you Game 5 tickets, made my pussy the sequel
So you really don't think about me?
And you really don't miss me?
Though I lullaby your brokenness, believe me i'm Ripley
But you struggling to love yourself, believe me that's karma
You want a nasty bitch, psychiatrist that cook like your mama
And all you got was me-me-me
But I love even though we're not meant to be, I still love you
I hope you find everything that you want, and she loves you
Everything is everything just know that I love you

[Phoelix:]
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk

// Don't Forget About Me //

Your family looking like a prison
Your momma at the table cryin
All her hair gone
Feeling fishy Finding Chemo
Smoking seaweed for calm
This Disney movie's too close
He told 'em, emo Noname thank you for your sweet Telefone
It saves lives
The secret is I'm actually broken
I tried to raise a healer kneeling at the edge of the ocean
Somebody, somebody said it saves lives
Who holds my hand at night? I think the glass half full
Who brought me back to Inglewood, I shouldn't bleed this good Holy conundrum
I'ma pray to hope the bank account wishin' both of my loved ones
Tell âem Noname still donât got no money
Tell 'em Noname almost passed out drinking
Secret is, she really think it saves lives
Somebody hit D'Angelo, I think I need him on this one
Brothers and sisters, mommas, cousins, uncles, everyone
Missing somebody
Dancing daylight

I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my daddy don't forget about me

Let's get down to the nitty gritty, changed my city
Titties 13k, pretty costs these days
Doctor really love me, I'm only half awake
I just came from the funeral, my ugly passed away
Welcome to Beverly Hills
Welcome to Vicodin, I took the pills
I think they save lives
I just hope that they pray
All I am is everything and nothing at all
All I am is shoulder for your heart to lean on
All I am is love, all I am is love

I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me

// Regal //

May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal
May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal

Oh my baby got to know me
I'm looking like I'm the homie
I'm tatted from head to shoulder
I'm colder when he don't hold me
I'm warmer inside the casket
Basket to tie my hair
Africa's never dead, Africa's always dying
No more apples or oranges
Only pickles and pacifists
Twitter ranting for martyrdom unified as capitalists
Give 'em death be gone
Give 'em Tefflon Don
Give 'em Rice-A-Roni politics to bear more arms
And watch the bears come out
Yeah

May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal
May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal

// Montego Bae //

[Ravyn Lenae:]
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay

How's it feel to be on my mind?
I can't believe I found you in time
I had a dream across seas for you and me
Sun ray on my lap I love it on my back
Oh sweet bae holy sun
Oh future husband, undress me under the moon
Sweet bae someday will come soon

I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay

[Noname:]
My lil' baby wanna smoke with me
Dread head in a party getting close to me
Said hol' up, slow up, roll up, roll up
Dance slow, baby, dance slow, baby smoke
Niggas off the gasoline
Smoking backwoods in the backwoods
Living lavishly
Ooh ooh, that's Mon-Montego Bay
I know my nigga like me
I know he cook his curry spicy
I know he eat me like I'm wifey
You know my hotel over pricey
So he gon' fuck me like I'm Oprah
Classy bitch only use a coaster
Now I'm swimmin in the money with a ducky too
Reading Toni Morrison in a nigga canoe
Cause a bitch really bout her freedom
Cause a bitch suckin dick in the new Adidas
And yes and yes, I'm problematic too
And yes and yes, I lick 'em up, oh yes I really do
Protection is a wave, wave cause we be open too
Jamaica thank you for my baby, I'm in love wit' you

// Ace //

[Smino:]
Whiskey with the team, got it bubblin
I got trees in my luggage
I got teams out in London
Hope you came, what you say?
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh when I say I been at the Ace hotel
You gotta tell me something
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
What you sayin?
I'm making runs

I'm roll on track, I'm in this field
I'm shot, you put me in my feels
She made it clap clap clap clappity-clap out in Clapton
Swerve and I crash if the pillow ain't your passion
She think I'm a liar like the Obamacare
If the old never heard the soul country so slick
Butterskin smooth Acne shoes, contradict
You can hop right offa my country

Team got it bubblin
I got trees in my luggage
I got teams out in London
Hope you came, what you say?
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh when I say I been at the Ace hotel
You gotta tell me something
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
What you sayin?
I'm making runs

[Noname:]
Smino Grigio, Noname, and Saba the best rappers
And radio niggas sound like they wearing adult diapers
And globalization is scary and fuckin is fantastic
And frankly I find it funny that Morgan is still acting
Bruce Almighty, Aphrodite and Dominoes
Yummy biscotti, tamale, over mention my undertones
Runnin the dolly, Chicago overzealous with talent though
Westside get the money, is still a classic
Move into LA, now I'm sippin on Sunny D
And my niggas is hella pleased and I bought me a better pencil
Bitch she ain't about to write, I'm perpetually smoking weed
Yes me rolling, I'm sorry, I'm tapping out
Room 25, the best album that's coming out
Labels got these niggas just doing it for the clout
I'm just writing my darkest secrets like wait and just hear me out
Saying vegan food is delicious like wait and just hear me out

[Saba:]
I ain't been at home in a minute, my landlord been getting pissed
Cause I barely count as a tenant, I'm overseas with the yen and shit
And I can't recall the last time that my live show was intimate
The price of the show just went up in addition to tickets that
They didn't figure it out in 2012 so I just said fuck it
Cause we can drop all our albums ourselves yeah I just said fuck it
Cause I know I got the gifts like an elf and been wrapping raps around them like I'm a belt
That's tea not ginger beer, I whisper in they ear
Since I left the road, I got more hits than a deer
A dollar and a dream like I'm Jermaine in the Ville
You stand or fall, pray, shout out to NFL
Pure bred delicatessen
Damn, I'm real, I can tell it
I do not fall to the pressure
Cookin' up Barefoot Contessa
I just raise the bar
I look at with a measure
With little to no effort
I thought it gonna be messed up
Bless up

[Smino:]
Whiskey with the team, got it bubblin
I got trees in my luggage
I got teams out in London
Hope you came, what you say?
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh what a day, I been at the Ace hotel
You gotta tell me something
Fuck is you sayin?
Oh let me tell you, I been on the way
What you sayin?
I'm making runs

// Part Of Me //

[Phoelix:]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave

[Noname:]
Riddle me this, Mona Lisa piece of pepperoni
Smilin over phony speakers, gettin a fit off-ten
Offa the shits, it's a party at my granny house
Now birthdays and funerals will only bring the family out
Riddle me new, politician do a dance for me
Hot potato, milly rock, devastation of kiddy bop
Idiot, itty bitty resentfulness
Riddle me gone, Chicago go go bye
Chicago East roam savage
Ashes for backstage passes
Ashes to house on Ashland
Chicago go go Kobe
Move to LA county
But all my old life there
But all my new life there
Riddle me, Lord. forgive me

[Phoelix:]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave

[Benjamin Earl Turner:]
Shaking the dust off my heel as I get infected
Weekend trips to my aunties was an antiseptic
The fat boy anorexic ain't admit
Cause my complexion rich like an Etch a Sketch
I'm sculpting the pain in em like ammonia Lewis
My notebooks less Jesus, more gospel to it
Let's holler and hoop and my niggas is stupid, my niggas is shooting
Your interpretation of that last bar will tell me where you was rooted
Me and mines amongst the [?]
I'm talking moonshine, night walkin', underground, high stakin'
Cop'll put the choppa on ya, make the pupils dilate
Oh what a drug is fear, oh what a love is close
Oh at the crib with the coupe deville with the overdose that made jealousy dance on the crowd
I been everywhere, everywhere let me down
Worn every hat every hat with a crown
Now every head bowed, dear God

[Phoelix:]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave

// With You //

This is my happy ever suicide
My hands tied behind my breast
My silhouette did pirouettes
The curtains are closing
My baby was my ooh-lah lah, neverlasting
My baby was my cry me rivers and shadow casket
Who could be my lovely, my lovely?
Who could be my only one, my only?
I'm almost just as empty as you think I am
A penny for your thoughts
A wooden hair of happiness, a pretty Ricky Ross
A may-black music
I woke up in my sympathy, became black Judas
All my everythings for sale
All my second hand discoveries, dungarees faded pale
All my halfway hallelujahs are tippy-toed in the mail
All the fluctuations on scales
And the missing therapy sessions of bullies treating me well-well
We don't drink that
If it ain't the top shelf, nigga you can keep that
Share my life on Telefone
I'm 25 at 306, and 809 became my home
Gave you a taste of my redemption and now I want my drink back
Somebody hold me like I'm almost enough
Somebody told me pray for heaven, saw how tiny it was
Little love from me, we can build this home alone
Alone
Forever with you, forever with you
I'm a home away from home and promise you'll keep this secret
And promise you won't forgive me to tell you that smells like peaches
He who leeches on love is a lame
Chains and left her for London, Wireless festival reparable, so good when he wasn't

// No Name //

No name for people to call small or colonize optimism
No name for inmate registries that they put me in prison
I sewed the answers in linen
Dance em' under the thread
Pretend I'm riding in your cities when niggas scared of the feds
There's a ghost on my bike
City lay with a bullet
He wrote the scriptures for living in all the ways that he couldn't
Gave up the profit for pennies
No taste in mystery pudding
When labels ask me to sign
So my name don't exist
So many names don't exist
Welcome to Inglewood
And the trauma came with the rent
Only worldly possession I have is life
Only room that I died in was 25
What's an eye for an eye when niggas won't love you back?
And medicine's overtaxed
No name look like you
No name for private corporations to send emails to
Cause when we walk into heaven
Nobody's name gon exist
[?] off a joy nigga [?] radiates

You are the joy [?]
I've cared for where you came, the end
Your song, your truth, your light is proof
And love is still [?]

Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
Your life, you life, is your life, baby
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
