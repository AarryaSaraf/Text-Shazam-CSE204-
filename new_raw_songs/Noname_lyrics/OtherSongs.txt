// Rainforest //

How you get closer to love?
How you lemonade all your sadness when you openin' up?
How you make excuses for billionaires, you broke on the bus?
I need niggas around me rollin' up and smokin' me up
Because, because a rainforest cries
Everybody dies a little
And I just wanna dance tonight
And I just wanna dance tonight
Ah, yeah

He my little baby Medusa, tippin' the juice up
I go back and forth in an Uber, travel for two months
I'm the emptiest hallelujah, open my chest up
It's a rabbit inside my hat, angel all dressed up
Lookin' to bless up at the milk and the honey gates
I make money for money sake, I been writin' a hundred days
Took the wretched out the earth and called it baby Fanon
I know my shoulder blades are shattered wings that carry me home
I said baby, come on
You know this flesh is only temporary, brittle as bone
Why don't you empty out your love for me, then chisel the stone?
These are ten Black commandments, a property loan
'Cause every bladed grass of earth, we don't actually own
"I am the I am," says Sam am I
The universe bleeds infinity, you got one life

Uh, yeah, how you get closer to love?
How you lemonade all your sadness when you openin' up?
How you make excuses for billionaires, you broke on the bus?
I need niggas around me rollin' up and smokin' me up
Because, because a rainforest cries (Cries)
Everybody dies a little (Everybody dies a little)
I just wanna dance tonight
I just wanna dance tonight (I just wanna dance tonight)

If you think you love me, then bury me when the sun up
Faded with the homie, he pearlin' another blunt up
Talkin' to Muhammed like, "Niggas don't really trust us"
Dyin' on stolen land for a dollar like that ain't fucked up
It's fuck they money, I'ma say it every song
Until the revolution come and all the feds start runnin'
Fuck a Good Will Hunting, this is brand new murder
Revolutionary suicide, then close the curtain
You ain't seen death, I can hear the blood on the moon
These niggas put a flag up on it, all they do is consume
Only animal that ravage everything in its path
They turned a natural resource into a bundle of cash
Made the world anti-Black, then divided the class
Now the rich niggas is rich niggas with your bread
Really bitch niggas with big figures, some cokeheads
These bitches is cokeheads, man, fuck a billionaire, nigga

How you get closer to love?
How you lemonade all your sadness when you openin' up?
How you make excuses for billionaires, you broke on the bus?
I need niggas around me rollin' up and smokin' me up
Because, because a rainforest cries (Cries)
Everybody dies a little (Everybody dies a little)
I just wanna dance tonight (Dance)
I just wanna dance tonight

// Restitution //

Baby, am I enough for you?
Baby, am I in love? Or is it tomorrow
I left my window all open
And you were hoping to borrow my time
I don't want you, I don't want you
A kiss goodnight was all I needed
A kiss goodbye was all I needed
Like you were my forever, ever, ever
My pretty baby, everything

I'm not a sinner, I just crush a lot
I can't call my kettle dark 'cause after dark, we fuck a lot
Kingdom come and crown me happy, Laffy Taffy, inner thot
This bitch will always ride for you, ride for you
You silly if you believe me, believe me, yeah, if I need be
Skinny like you like it, fake titties
On lovers island, take a dip in my river

You can keep your cup of water
Though I'm thirsty, I can't take it no more
I need some restitution, mercy on your soul
I'm letting you go

Baby, am I enough for you?
Baby, am I in love? Or is it tomorrow
I left my window all open
And you were hoping to borrow my time
I don't want you, I don't want you
A kiss goodnight was all I needed
A kiss goodbye was all I needed
Like you were my forever, ever, ever
My pretty baby, everything

I'm not a sinner, I just crush a lot
I can't call my kettle dark 'cause after dark, we fuck a lot
Kingdom come and crown me happy, Laffy Taffy, inner thot
This bitch will always ride for you, ride for you
You silly if you believe me, believe me, yeah, if I need be
Skinny like you like it, fake titties
On lovers island, take a dip in my river

You can keep your cup of water
Though I'm thirsty, I can't take it no more
I need some restitution, mercy on your soul
I'm letting you go

// Song 31 //

[Noname:]
All my everything is for you
All my terrible sense of humor and critical interviews
All my pearly gated redemption and casual afternoons
All this money and law-makin', like racin' against the moon, but
I sell pain for profit and I feel profit watching
Everything is for everything, rhymin' with casualty
I know labels is backing me but, my tickets be selling out
And I'm steady raising my fetus, another hit from the fee
110 degrees, in the desert heat
With a bubble coat, turtleneck underneath
Rolling up on the beach, smoking a holy leaf
Laughing, baking, my homie T, hoping joking is all we need
When I sell pain for profit
Now I binge-watch Atlanta
No more TV representation from a Kelsey Grammer
Let's toast to niggas getting checks to work behind the camera
Somebody raise their nana

[Phoelix:]
Truth be told
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Watch you sit it on the shelf
Now my body got cold
I swear we'll never leave
Had to do it for myself
To find my praise
Go, get your weapon

[Noname:]
Real recognize real feeling like real prove
Real buddy-buddy after the trip to the Cancun
Million dollar baby bet you can get to the hands too
Got a pack of wolves ready to damage a full moon
The only bitch actually rapping look like me now
A meow, kitty just reimagined a freestyle
Damn flood of niggas still watin' for me to reach out
We shadowboxing the government
Hoping they put the leash down
I sell pain for profit, not propaganda
I know cancer's origin linked to Santa
I know Santa's origins linked to money
Mass production of cattle, slaughtering for the yummy
These niggas is clever, the prison no better
The ghost of the living, we ain't talking about Reggie
On Christmas we almost forget him
What's a casket to a holdin' cell if a nigga ain't in it?
Only reason why I'm steady fadin' and still independent

[Phoelix:]
Truth be told
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Watch you sit it on the shelf
Now my body got cold
I swear we'll never leave
Had to do it for myself
To find my praise
Go, get your weapon

// Song 32 //

Fee-fi-fo, cigarillo, cigarillo
I'm shaking up with the trees, how I keep the leaf in the middle
I'm more than these hotel rentals and dental bills adding up
I'm the Kennedys out for lunch with a preacher, martyr the king
I'm Cardi's engagement ring, I'm America showing off
I'm Viacom, Viacom, I'm Chappelle in Pelle Pelle
And rapping like Dyalan, spell it like Dylan
Gave my body to Adam, he told to lie for him
Apple wasn't the apple, the truest sin was the pussy
I'm patriarchy on Sunday, don't push me, I'm Viacom
Y'all niggas got Diddy money, don't push me, I'm atom bomb
I'm Obama pushing the button, in Lybia, Pakistan
Humanly a hypocrite, the sinner and the civilian
The pettiest that gets, I'm America at its best
Yeah, I'm America at its best
Boom boom, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Started getting money from writing the haiku
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Everybody on me, I'm lookin' just like you
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
If you smoking dope, then your shorty can come too
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay

Riddle me happy, I'm lonely, hysteria
A lone gunman outside the parking lot, Missus America
I'm everything that you're not, like Kendrick before his prime
I'm the ticking inside his watch, and an underdog you forgot
Got privilege and money
Part of me buried in the earth, part of me chasin' more money
Parted with artificial trappings, y'all can't take nothing from me
I'm going dummy for dummy
If all my godliness is measured by the way that y'all love me, I'm free

Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Started getting money from writing the haiku
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Everybody on me, I'm lookin' just like you
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
If you smoking dope, then your shorty can come too
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay

Haiku
Like you, like you
No, no, come too

// Song 33 //

Oh, I have ambitions, dreams
But dreams don't come cheap

I saw a demon on my shoulder, it's lookin' like patriarchy
Like scrubbin' blood off the ceiling and bleachin' another carpet
How my house get haunted?
Why Toyin body don't embody all the life she wanted?
A baby, just nineteen
I know I dream all black
I seen her everything, immortalizin' tweets all caps
They say they found her dead

One girl missin', another one go missin'
One girl missin', another

But niggas in the back quiet as a church mouse
Basement studio when duty calls to get the verse out
I guess the ego hurt now
It's time to go to work, wow, look at him go
He really 'bout to write about me when the world is in smokes?
When it's people in trees?
When George was beggin' for his mother, saying he couldn't breathe
You thought to write about me?

One girl missin', another one go missin'
One girl missin', another one

Yo, but little did I know all my readin' would be a bother
It's trans women bein' murdered and this is all he can offer?
And this is all y'all receive?
Distracting from the convo with organizers
They talkin' abolishin' the police
And this the new world order
We democratizin' Amazon, we burn down borders
This a new vanguard, this a new vanguard
I'm the new vanguard
