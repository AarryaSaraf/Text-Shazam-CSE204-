// Synthetic Flying Machine //

Up and over
We go through the waving undertow
I will float until I learn how to swim
Inside my mother in a garbage bin
Until I find myself again
Again

Up and over
We go mouths open wide and spilling snow
I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me
Me

Up and over
Eyes open wide into down below
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine
Machine

OK

// Wood Guitar //

Here we are, a final moment
found inside a wood guitar
That splits the seams wide open
Oh Oh
âcause I know who you are
You paint the doors and walls 
and listen for the bell-chime calls
And life is nothing more at all than
tea-cup drips and bouncing balls
And Oh
It's real, and never fading
Listen to the strings you've strung
and all the words you're saying now

Sing a song, a song with feeling
that sounds best when you've hit the bong 
and concludes deeper meaning
Oh Oh
âcause I know sometimes
All the thoughts can sometimes hit
Confusion as the record skips
But who needs fools to think youâre hip
When all the world is full of shit
And Oh
I hear the timbres you're playing
It sits inside the summer sky
It's softly cascading

// Swallowed //

Everywhere I go
Swallowed up inside
[Repeating]

// Tea Time //

And I will take all of the pain that I can stand

// Rubby Bulbs //

I need to taste your voice in my mouth
I need to taste your voice in the air
And I need to feel your skin against all that I retch out
And feel your voice all over everywhere

I need to paste your skin around the mailbox
And hold the postman in your smile
I need to fill your lungs with smallpox
And fill the glow of a sick and distorted life

Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful babies
All filled with angels

// Biscuit //

Your mother's mouth pressed gently against doorknobs
And there's so much fuckin' piss swimming into and out of the kitchen
Three feet up to the knees with cups and carrot sticks from our warm, golden glow of the refrigerator
