// Heroin Bag //

It's come and gone
And it's a million miles away
The dress she wore is all that shall remain
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But now you find it stays, they come
And remain unchanged

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag

It's come and gone
And it's never coming home
You push to far and then you break the bone
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But now you find it stays, they come
And leave you alone

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag

So long now
There's not a flower left in you
It's just your eyes and now they're made of stone
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But then you get it on, get it on and then it's
Right on your own

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag

// Life Is Neverending //

If I were a mirror
I'd look right deep myself
And if things were much clearer
I'd see a brighter day

And if you were my lover
I'd wrap your locks around my wrist
And shake beneath the shudders
That turn to black or fade

For you know that life is never ending
But some times the miles do seem too long to try
But I've got a love
She is my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood, and hate and anger
And let it go

If I were the summer
I'd give my light to all the world
And wake you in your slumber
So you could see my eyes

And as your feelings crumble
And all the words I keep unfurl
I'll catch you in your tumble
And kiss your face goodbye

For you know that life is never ending
But some times the miles do seem too long to try
But I've got a love
She is my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood, and hate and anger
And let it go

If I were made of water
I'd slip my thumbs into the cracks
And freeze when it got colder
To hold the walls in, true

And when it came to summer
I'd slip my soul into the yard
And give life to the flowers
That I never gave to you

But I know that life is never ending
But some times the miles can cut you down to size
But I had a love
She was my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood you never gave her
And let it go

// Follow Me Down //

Follow me down
Strings of water plain
Eyes are underground
Wash the seed away
Hands are feathered drums that spin
Sound inside the quay

Follow me down
Follow me today

Found you wishing rainbows
Tasting words of wine
Felt just like a painting
Colour stripping eye
The sun creeps through your window
And slowly fades away

Follow me down
Follow me today

// Angel Eyes //

Angel eyes
You will sleep tonight
But do not be surprised
When you're not waking

You gave away your soul
And the rest, they stole
But now it's your own life that you are taking.

And all the world will rise in the morning
A sun will shine inside a winter sky
But you won't be around to see that dawning
Oh, your heart will take the wind
And I will, once again, say goodbye.

Sweet surprise,
Look into the night
For it will be the last
You'll be receiving

And when at last you fly
And kiss this world goodbye
You'll be in my mind when I am dreaming

And all the world will rise in the morning
A sun will shine inside a winter sky
But you won't be around to see that dawning
Oh, your heart will take the wind
And I will, once again, say goodbye
Ohh, say goodbyeâ¦ [x3]
