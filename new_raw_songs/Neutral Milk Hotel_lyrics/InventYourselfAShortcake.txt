// Calypso, Part 1 //

I have a photograph of your insides
Dated June 2nd, 1989
I'm positive
It's a photograph of your insides

// My Dreamgirl (Don't Exist) //

My dream
My dream girl don't exist 
At the age of 5 she slit her wrists
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around 
So her parents buried her in the ground 
My dream girl don't exist
She's working at a McDonald's in Madison Wisconsin
She could have been cool but she let the system get to her
She forgot all about art and just made hamburgers
My dream girl don't exist
They're sitting around watching TV
They're out stuffing- shit

// Chocolate Coffin //

A lot about coffins made of candy, and a little about ice cream

// Sinking Ship //

Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness spills against my face
Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still? 
Oh, can't you feel the coming waves?
A perfect Sunday portrait of my mother painting horses all alone
Of lovers and of leavers still believing they are free to come and go

Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness is all that you are
A portrait of my father as a baby sleeping underneath the stars
A small pill of forgiveness I am giving to myself
It's what I need
A small gift of fulfillment I am hoping you will open and receive

Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness fills this empty room
A portrait of your lover softly drowning in the warm waters of June
A perfect Sunday portrait of my mother sending signals through the drum
A portrait of my sadness finding shelter in the safety of my home

// Random Noise //

No sky
No sky to go with it
No
No
No
[Repeats]

// A&E Melody //

You can deny all your addictions
da da da da da
(burp)
do do de de do
(burp)
la la la la la la la
That's how the melody goes
It's on tape so I won't forget it
'Cause I'm a pretty weird guy
And I probably won't remember it
'Cause it's currently 2:30 in the morning
And I'm smoking cigarettes
And I just came up with this melody and wrote some lyrics
And I think it's gonna turn into a song
So I guess I'll just put it on a tape
But then again these tapes cost me two dollars
And I'm wasting more space than I should
So I'll shut up
So OK
