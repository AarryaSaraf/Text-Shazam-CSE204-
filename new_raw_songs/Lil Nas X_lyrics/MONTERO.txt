Album: MONTERO

// MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) //

I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Oh, call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
I do not care if you lyin'

Well I'm just feelin', mm-uh
I wanna get, mm-uh
I'm in my, into my, uh
I'm mm, mm
I'm still, mm, mm-mm

// DEAD RIGHT NOW //

Breaker, breaker
911, somebody come get this bitch
Thinking you a star on the rise, you got time to reply
Don't lie, you can hit my shit

You can lend me five lil' niggas on the side, lil' nigga
Couple thou', need to fix my whip
How you switch sides on a nigga who was down with you, nigga?
You a fraud, just a fib my nig', my nig'

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

2018, I was in my sister's house the whole summer
Songs wasn't doing numbers
Whole life was going under
Left school, then my dad and I had a face to face in Atlanta
He said, "It's one in a million chance, son," I told him, "Daddy, I am that one-uh, uh-uh"

I ain't never need 'em
I ain't never need no nigga
I ain't never need no feature
If I didn't blow up, I woulda died tryna be here
If it didn't go, suicide, wouldn't be here
Now they all come around like they been here
When you get this rich and famous everybody come up to you singing

Hallelujah
How'd you do it?
You been on my mind
You been running through it, yeah
Hallelujah
How'd you do it?
You been on my mind
You been running through it, yeah

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

Mama told me she was gon' stop fuckin' round with that nigga
Told me she was clean, but I'm knowing that her ass a deceiver
My mama told me that she love me, don't believe her
When she get drunk, she hit me up, mad with a fever like whoa

You ain't even all that pretty
You ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with' me, God won't forgive ya
Shit

You ain't even all that pretty
You ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with' me, God won't forgive ya

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

Treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

They couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy
Y'all shouldn't let the world gas me (woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control
Said I would then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (aye)
Where's y'all sense of humor? (aye)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers
I make vets feel like they're juniors (juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma
Mine is comin' sooner
I'm just a late bloomer
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

// THATS WHAT I WANT //

1, 2, 3, 4
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah we did it before but we'll do it tonight
That afro' black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin looking at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he coming over to me, yeah

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

Look
You know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and weary
Like tell me there's life when I'm stressing at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and "Everything is alright", uh
Love me or nothing 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of ya brain

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

// THE ART OF REALIZATION //

I been drivin' a lot, just drivin' in life
With no actual direction, not heading towards any specific place
It's like for who?
Is it for me? Am I happy?
I like that second one
I'm not sure, I'm not sure, unsure

// SCOOP //

// LOST IN THE CITADEL //

Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy?
Do your dreams still seem in-bound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find a way to come back around

I need time to get up, and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'll only come right back for more

My God, you're an angel
I only see you in your halo
I was hoping we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes

I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you was someone I could vent to
So I hit you like what you getting into?

I need time to get up, and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'll only come right back for more

Why I thought it was forever?
I only see you maybe never
Why I thought we'd be together
When you treat it like whatever

Yeah, yeah, yeah
My love for falling down
Playing the victim when all my envisionings
Come slowly tumbling down
Putting me back on the ground

I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you was someone I could vent to
So I hit you like what you getting into?

I need time to get up, and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'll only come right back for more

Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy?
Do your dreams still seem in-bound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find a way to come back around

// DOLLA SIGN SLIME //

(Daytrip took it to ten)

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Nieman's and Marcus I'm berry'd out
Walk in the bank and say fuck it let's clear it out

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)

Yeah, album gon' hit like it's 82
Got a new whip and it's navy blue
Top of the game, only 22
Look at me nigga, then look at you
You just a opp and a flop of a nigga
I'm sorry that I gotta say the truth
Thought I wouldn't pop but I popped on you niggas
Now I'm with the hits like I'm Babe Ruth

Bitch, I do not do labor
You know I done got too major
Bought a new house, few acres
I done went and got new neighbors
So fuck all that "Nas, be considerate"
I'm really that nigga that's killing it
Man all of y'all niggas equivalent
I'm really that nigga that's different

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Nieman's and Marcus I'm berry'd out
Walk in the bank and say fuck it let's clear it out

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)

(Real hot girl shit)
They can't stop me, say I can't do it, bitch, watch me
All you lame hoes turn hatin' to a hobby
Damn, watchin' me gotta turn you on
I should have my own category in porn
Ooh, I'm just such an obsession
Tea about me, your IG suggestions
Thick, no add-on prosthetics
Everything about me came from genetics
Yeah, I been gettin' money, I ain't new to this
Miss one, catch one, I ain't new to fish
But if he throwin' it raw
And I get hooked, then you're doin' your job
Baby, all these hoes imitate me
You could fuck a Stan or the Real Slim Shady
Niggas be toxic, suck your soul out then block him
Got more cream than a sundae topping

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)

// TALES OF DOMINICA //

Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me feel like there's only now

I've been living at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home
I can't face her face

Finally grown
Ain't nothing like I hoped it would be
Out on my own
I'm floating in an ocean-less sea
Could I be wrong?
Was everybody right about me?
Scary things in my head
I can't dream, man I just

Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me feel like there's only now

I've been living at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home
I can't face her face

// SUN GOES DOWN //

I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun
And I'll see the sun

I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun
And I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak
You just take it all to the face

I know that you want to cry
But it's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes
And people who threw dirt on your name

Since ten, I been feeling lonely
Had friends but they was picking on me
Always thinking why my lips so big
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?

These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fighting
And nobody knows it when you're silent

I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki morning into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?

And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'mma make my fans so proud of me (Oh)

I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun
And I'll see the sun

I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun
And I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak
You just take it all to the face

I know that you want to cry
But it's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes
And people who threw dirt on your name

Ooh
Hoooahh
Unooooh

// VOID //

Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems

I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea

Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo
Hodo, Hodo
It seems so much out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway
Hodo
Hodo, Hodo

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now, before I go

Oh, Blue
I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue
I love you too
But, today I'm gonna run away from home

Oh, I weep through the night
Can't find a love who loves me the same
Or as much as you do
Hodo
Hodo, Hodo
Oh, I reach out my hand, hoping that they'll see
I'm more than what everyone tells me
Hodo
Hodo, Hodo

See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now, before I go

Oh, Blue
I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue
I love you too
But, today I'm gonna run away from home

Away from home
Ah, oh
Today I'm gonna run away
Today I'm gonna run away

// DONT WANT IT //

If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm unwanted but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright

I smoke myself to sleep
I'm sad, I think I'm feeling lonely
Took one too many shots last night
And I spent all my money

Started thinking, am I stupid to be fawning
Over things that's been haunting me all my life?
Ain't I fucking living proof that if you want it
You can have anything right before your eyes? ('Fore your eyes)

And the award goes to... Lil Nas X
Lil Nas X
Lil Nas X
Lil Nas X
The number 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100
Call Me By Your Name by Lil Nas X

I wanted fame and I wanted riches
Wanted happiness, wanted forgiveness
Started focusing on all these wishes
Crazy how this shit come to fruition

I've done things in my past I'm sorry for
So please don't hold me
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me

If I say so, know they gon' ride (Gon' ride)
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm unwanted but I get by (Get by)
Tell the devil I can't have him inside

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright (Be alright)
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright (Be alright)

// LIFE AFTER SALEM //

All of my feelings are gone
I left 'em all on the floor
Man, who's to blame if you don't love me no more?
No, I don't mind just take whatever you want

Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave
Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave

What you want from me, yeah
What you want from me, yeah

Get yourself an Adderall
Then throw me up against the wall
And kick me when I have to crawl
Ooh, I love it when you show no love at all

You know I can be your part-time lover
Our scars, they'll dance with each other
I can be your part time lover
Our scars they'll dance with each other

Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave
Why don't you just take what you want from me?
I think you should take what you want and leave

What you want from me, yeah
What you want from me, yeah

You're changing
You're changing everyday
You played me
I let you run the game

You're changing
You're changing everyday
And you're taking
You're taking everything

// AM I DREAMING //

Every song
Every dream filled with help from beyond
As I'm sinking
I relive the story

Every try
Every breakthrough and every cry
As I'm sinking
I relive the story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fading
Replaying these thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done

Tears running dry
Shattered inside, but I still gotta smile
As I'm sinking, I relive the story
Glitter comes off, battered and blue, but I gotta go on
As I'm singing, I rewrite my story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fading
Replaying these thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
