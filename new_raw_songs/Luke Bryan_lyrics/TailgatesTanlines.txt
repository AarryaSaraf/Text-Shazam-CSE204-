// Country Girl (Shake It For Me) //

Hey girl. Go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love

Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
That got it in her blood to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile

So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big old barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Guitar!

Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yeah
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes

All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Oh, country girl
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

// Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye //

All we do right is make love and
We both know now that ainât enough
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didnât work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt
Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Ainât gonna beg you to stay
Ainât gotta ask you whatâs wrong
Ainât no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Letâs do what we do best
I guess everybodyâs got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnât have to try
Letâs lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Kiss tomorrow goodbye.

// Drunk On You //

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drives
In a tail light circle

Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10 you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt

Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good god almighty

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

// Too Damn Young //

We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out scared, she might get caught
We were nervous, but it was worth it

There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said "I better go"
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep

So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was wakin' up my life
To what love was, I can still see us

Every time my feet are danglin' in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lyin' there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doin' but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
[x2]

We were too damn young to know any better

// Don't Want This Night To End //

Girl I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out
Over my hood
And all I know now
Is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know
What road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know
Is I don't want
This night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain't no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash
Says 3:35
There's plenty of gas
And the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know
What road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know
Is I don't want
This night to end

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't
Know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know
Is I don't want
This night to end

I don't want this night to end
No, I don't want this night to end

// You Don't Know Jack //

He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think.
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"

But you don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack.

He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma,
She said I couldn't stay.
And buddy if you're wonderin',
How could I throw it all away"

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack.

If you never felt the fire,
Running through your veins,
If you've never seen the devil,
Face to face...

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God,
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack.
You don't know Jack.

// Harvest Time //

There's peanut dust and corn husks driftin' through the air tonight
The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

[Chorus:]
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

There's a thermos and a water jug rollin' around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringin' us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

[Chorus]

At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til it's all done until we're all done

[Chorus]

// I Know You're Gonna Be There //

I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't wanna make a fool of myself
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there

And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there

You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl, I know you're gonna be there
Gonna walk right by that table were you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's gonna be an accident
I know you're gonna be there

I'm gonna act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're gonna be there

And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in real close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there

I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see yah, I don't know what I'll do

// Muckalee Creek Water //

It flows underneath the 32 bridge
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs
And gators in the weeds waitin' for ya

I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee creek water

Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a crawfish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits

I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas soar through the roof

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee creek water

I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody jacking with me
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights

Well I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get down deep in that Muckalee creek water
That Muckalee creek water

// Tailgate Blues //

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That Iâm down and I ainât alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then Iâll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I ainât sure were it all began
Somewhere âround here I know
This bridge was a little more crowded then
I was playing her a tailgate show
And now Iâm just sittinâ here alone

To catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That Iâm down and I ainât alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then Iâll tell them what I lost
Oh Iâve got the tailgate blues

Damn that AM radio
For playing more than a song
My heart wonât beat if the strings are broke
The melodyâs hittinâ me wrong
Right here where she belongs

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That Iâm down and I ainât alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then Iâll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

The crickets heard my story and I listened to em sing
I guess Iâll close the tailgate up
There ainât no telling what tomorrow might bring
Maybe me and a Dixie cup
But that wonât be enoughâ¦

Yes I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That Iâm down and I ainât alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then Iâll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That Iâm down and I ainât alright

// Been There, Done That //

Girl you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There ain't nothin' left for us I think enough's enough
I look down see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around, baby you can have it all

[Chorus:]
I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back,
I've been there done that

Street by street and town after little town
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're probably wondering how I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should
To try to make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see
We weren't meant to be

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'll wake up, and I'll start to second guess myself
And I'll crave your touch, oh but I know too well...

[Chorus:]
That I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back,
No, I ain't coming back
I've been there done that

// Faded Away //

I don't remember much about that time,
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine.
Riding the strip, sittin' on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had.

It was spring break, we were out late,
And I though goodness for heavens sake.
When I saw you...
And then I kissed you...

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you... faded away.

I still taste the shots on your lips that night,
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body takin' off your dress,
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess.
So if I'da known, I'da held on...
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose,
Cause I still see you...

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you... faded away.

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say.

Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you... faded away.
You faded away.

// I Knew You That Way //

The secret way long shadows bleed into the night
The desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain
I knew you that way

The way cool mountain waters dance down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives in to the passion of the path it takes
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet ease that makes a lover want to stay
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The holy way that love knows it should never end
The sacred way that stars got sailors home again
Like teardrops know the words to amazing grace
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I knew you that way

// That Don't Just Happen //

Rocks bang together
Things start blowin' up
Planets all align around a big red sun
Then we're all here
That don't just happen

Two tiny cells collide
Then she feels a kick
Soon the baby cries and your goin' home with him
Then he says daddy
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Crops are in the field
There ain't no rain nowhere
Ground is cracks and dust
The whole town is in despair
Then a farmer prays and the storms roll in
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Oh, You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Every time we take a deep breath
And every time that the wheels touchdown
Every time we take another step
And have one more day to hang around
Know we didn't get that lucky
Cause that don't just happen
That don't just happen

Someone picked you out
Put you in front of me
In a smoky college bar
The rest is history
That don't just happen
