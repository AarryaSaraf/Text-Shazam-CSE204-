// She Get Me High //

Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me

She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Come on!

She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the pool and moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine

She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Hey!

// Like We Ain't Ever //

Yeah I've iced down a few thousand beers in my day
To put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it ain't hundreds, it ain't any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends
Have the time of your life
There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

This ain't the first time we've partied under these stars
Making a hangover
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know...know better
Like we ain't ever

There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...
Let's do it up right...

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know...know better
Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever

// Night One //

Where you been hiding all week girl?
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar, in every place
Somehow I miss your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

Wish I had met you on Night One
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Let's make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
'Fore we say our goodbyes girls

Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

Wish I had met you on Night One
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

// Are You Leaving With Him //

I've been watching him talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong how he, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see you
You're too pretty to be left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my in to ease on in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my in to ease on in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me

It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my in to ease on in
While he's just waiting for the night to end

I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
(Are you really leaving with him)
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
Come on girl, won't you go with me

// Good Lookin' Girl //

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start...

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, oh you boy you got it so damn good

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even need becase it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
Cause you start

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl

Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite when you're...

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gon' lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl

You're my good looking girl
What's up girl

// The Sand I Brought To The Beach //

Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I poured her into my ride
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning up my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Ohh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

Oh well looks like I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City

Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah
It's on me
So, here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Y'all drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need

'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach

// My Ol' Bronco //

Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet
It's a cut out picture of the '70s
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow

My Ol' Bronco!

I flipped it over up on Arno Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
And you know where I've been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in a beach bar parking lot

No, it ain't hard to pick me out
'Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow
Know I won't ever let her go
My Ol' Bronco, my Ol' Bronco

Yeah, it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a back road
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's 3 on the tree and geared down for going slow

No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My Ol' Bronco, my Ol' Bronco

// Games //

You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
But you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

This break-up, make-up, hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me, 
What am I supposed to do with you 

And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games

// Spring Breakdown //

It's been a real good run
Playing out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear y'all don't know what ya mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started this week long party
And to think that it's over

It makes me wanna spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
And how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
Ohh but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown

Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishing I was down there with ya hanging out
It'll kill me then, but I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round

Before I spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
Yea how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown

We made this sun tan city yea all of y'all's 
Sing-a-long so loud
We took this beach town over
Y'all don't know it might sound crazy
But y'all gonna make me spring breakdown
Just thinking about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever and ever
Ohh but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how
This is our last song
I'm bout to spring breakdown
Swear I'm bout to spring breakdown

Y'all up there on them shoulders
The good and bad hangovers
I'm bout to spring breakdown

// Checkin' Out //

How many buds can you fit in the backseat
How many cans can you throw in a floorboard
Mama's credit card and your brother's ID
Six bodies, one bed, good lord

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, rays of sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Lite
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey little shot girl
Give me the whole tray
Baby what's your name?
Party at my place
Here's to a headache
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

Alabama baby pullin' up in a black Jeep
Two Georgia boys hollerin' "Hey, what's up?"
Parking lot, peeking back ,burnin' their bare feet
They comin' in hot, somebody best get the door

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, rays of sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Lite
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey little shot girl
Give me the whole tray
Baby what's your name?
Party at my place
Here's to a headache (ha)
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

All the bars and the cars up and down the beach
Checkin' in with your mama now and then
Knowin' she can't sleep, hey
Shh, y'all hold it down
"Hey mama, yeah, I'm being good.
No, we ain't partying, it's the TV."

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, rays of sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Lite
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey my little shot girl
Give me the whole tray
Baby what's your name?
Party at my place
Here's to a headache (aw)
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out
Checkin' out

// You And The Beach //

My shoulders still burn, my head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard, and lipstick on a straw,
Your crying eyes are painted in my rear view
My speakers still blast that song that you turned me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
That salt air is pulling on my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
'Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
That salt air is pulling on my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
It's like we never even said goodbye
It don't feel like you're really gone
You and the beach followed me home
