Album: WhatMakesYouCountry

// What Makes You Country //

People talkin' 'bout what is and what ain't country
What gives 'em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain
We're all a little different, but we're all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was 12
On a no cab tractor hauling 'em bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side covered down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlighting, that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
It feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live-oak church
Silver Queen corn in the backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side covered down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlighting, that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

I got my dirt road cred back when I was 12
On a no cab tractor haulin' 'em bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side covered down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlighting, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judge
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kinda country
They doing their kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

// Out Of Nowhere Girl //

It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl

My out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl
Out of nowhere girl

// Light It Up //

I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don't leave my sight since we had that fight
Can't remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
'Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick 'I miss you' pictures
I'm on your clock, you're in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
'Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don't get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

// Most People Are Good //

I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

// Sunrise, Sunburn, Sunset //

Your daddy had a lake house
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cut-off jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up and nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up and nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up and nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

// Bad Lovers //

Sun coming up through the blinds on your pretty face
I'm just laying in these tangled sheets, watching you walk away
We been deep in love, all messed up, and everything in between
From fly to fall, we tried it all
Girl, we been a lot of things

But baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Not one time, baby

Weather man calling for rain on Saturday
Girl, what you got goin' on, your place or my place?
When its tepid on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history

Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no, no, no, no

Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we better off, under covers
Yeah. we might not string all the good times togeher
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
We ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no

// Drinking Again //

It's five o'clock, so we're drinking again
Wearing flip flops, so we're drinking again
There's a jukebox, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
The suns out, so we're drinking again
Somebody bought a round, so we're drinking again
But we're all here and we got cold beer
And we're all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

The bartender's pretty so we're drinking again
Thinking kinda dirty so we're drinking again
It's past beer 30, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
Just got paid, so we're drinking again
Here comes the shot tray, so we're drinking again
Got a ride home and the bar ain't closed
So we're all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

Our team's playing, so we're drinking again
Cars are racin', so we're drinking again
I guess we're staying, so were drinking again
We're all drinking again
It's two for one, so were drinking again
It sure is fun, so were drinking again
The girls are friendly and this one's empty
So wer'e all drinking again

We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
Yeah, we're all drinking again
How 'bout another one? We're all drinking again

Nobody wants to leave
Somebody put it on my card
Declined? Alright, here's another
Alright
How'd we wind up here?
Who brought us here?
Same time, same place tomorrow!

// Land Of A Million Songs //

You don't know why, you can't make it stop
You were hooked with your daddy's hand-me-down flat top
The first time that you made your first love cry
And the words you wrote were running from her eyes
Down on the paper, made you feel so alive
So you packed up your pickup and crossed that Tennessee line

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
Find your old guitar, write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Everybody's got a story that needs to be sold
And they pray someday they'll hang a little gold
And ride back to their hometown with their head held high
On any given day, there's a dream, there's a chance
That lightning will strike at the end of a pen
And all the leaving, and losing, will all be worth the fight

So you're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You take that loan dot job just to pay the rent
You learn a few things from them hard-working men
You listen to 'em laugh and you listen to 'em curse
You find your old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs

Some will come and some will go
If you don't lay it all out there, you'll never know

You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
In the land of a million songs

// Like You Say You Do //

I watch you tell everyone
That she is your only one
But I see the other side
Know all the things you try to hide
Man, you put you up a real good front
You thinking you've got everyone
But you ain't got me fooled
I see right through

If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

Think you go as simple as you walk away
There ain't too much you even gotta say
You don't have to hurt her anymore
It's just a turnin' of a door
And don't you worry about bein' gone
'Cause she won't want for nothing too long
'Cause I see what you couldn't see
And I wanna be what you wouldn't be

If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
No, no, no
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do

// Hooked On It //

First time I tied a plastic worm on and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old tune tone it
I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips, I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on!

Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it

// She's A Hot One //

Running kind of late, got her makeup half on
Touch it up good enough, oh, whatever
All her girlfriends waiting outside on her
They've been blowing up her phone
Girl come on, get yourself together
Got her hands up she's so ready with her driver on the way
Skips the damn line, she ain't even gotta pay

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

She's dancing like every guy in here ain't watching her
Do her thang, make it rain, God to mighty
She's breaking necks, got them spilling beer
Putting that bartender through a year or two of Junior college
She's about to get them Dolce Vita's on the bar
It's all but all over the minute she starts

Feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

Like the summer heat where she comes from
She's burning me down
Just look at her now
Just look at her now
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

// Hungover In A Hotel Room //

Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

Slide the curtains back
Light up the morning on the balcony
Look at you stirring in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

There's that smile driving me wild
Call the front desk, late check out out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night

Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
Hungover in a hotel room
Hungover in a hotel room

// Pick It Up //

I put a fishing rod by your bed
Right next to a Bible
I leaned a guitar in the corner of your room
With some Milsap on vinyl
I figured the best thing I could do was put a thing or two
And that it wouldn't hurt to have in your way, on your path

Hoping you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up

Early to rise, headin' to work
Open a door for a stranger
Yes sir, yes Mama, red dirt on my hands
Showing you the best way I can

So you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But i didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up

Dancing and kissing your Mama in the kitchen
Treatin' her like a princess, hoping you might pick it up one day
Hoping you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it
I don't know what you gonna be
But i hope you smile when you think of me
Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up, pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up, yeah

I hope you pick it up
You just pick it up

// Driving This Thing //

I know this town like the back of my hand
Every back road, every turn road
Baby, where you wanna go?
Get you there with my eyes closed
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Been waiting all day just to see what you got on
Is it your high heels, your blue jeans?
Maybe that red dress, or climing up in your bare feet
I'll put the pedal down, but baby, you got the keys

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, you're calling the shots

We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight

You're driving this thing tonight
Just pick a spot, just say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight, youre calling the shots

// Win Life //

Ain't tryna to be hero
Just tryna cash a paycheck
'Til the clock hits zero
Make the most of these days left
Found a few shortcuts
Picked up a couple secrets
Don't have it figured out yet
But I've learned the hard way, it's...

More drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Just trying to win life

Man, in a couple scrapes, I barely got out of
Got a couple scars, I kinda ain't proud of
But you can't be afraid to drive until the gas can's empty
And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey

And be more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Watching those numbers on the scoreboard clock unwind
Still trying to win life

But if you lose yourself in someone else
Than maybe you don't lose at all

Just be more more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
And that hail Mary's coming down on the five yard line
And I'm trying to win life

Just trying to win life
I'll be trying to win life
