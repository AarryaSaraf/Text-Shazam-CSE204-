// Valentine, Texas //

Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight
Who will I become tonight
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire

Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me

// Working For The Knife //

I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife

I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys

I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife

I used to think I'd be done by 20
Now at 29 the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at 30 I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife

I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife

// Stay Soft //

Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye

It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight

Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

Only natural to harden up

// Everyone //

Everyone, all of them
Everyone said don't go that way
So, of course, to that I said
I think I'll go that way

And I left the door open to the dark
I said come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again

// Heat Lightning //

Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since 1:00 and, now, it's 4 o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you?
Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

// The Only Heartbreaker //

If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker

// Love Me More //

If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl

I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me here

Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up?
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to

Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more

// There's Nothing Left Here For You //

There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love
You saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's counting on

There's nothing left for you

// Should've Been Me //

Well I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'm sorry it should've been me

// I Guess //

I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn
To be somebody else

It's been you and me
Since before I was me
Without you I don't yet know
Quite how to live

If I could keep
Anything of you
I would keep
Just this quiet after you

It's still as a pond
I am staring into
From here I can say
Thank you
From here I can tell you
Thank you

// That's Our Lamp //

We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to

That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

// Glide (Lily Chou-Chou) //

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony
