// Pain With An Anchor //

Oh, my dear
Look what we've done here
My greatest fear
A pain with an anchor
The taste of defeat

Oh, my dear
Look what we've come to
We've shattered serene

I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers

Oh my dear
The damage is done here
I disappear
A love with no anchor
In the depths of the sea

I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers

// The Crux //

Another sinking stone
Finds its way down below
Resurface when only light will ever show

And while I progress slow
I'm soon to surpass you
Entitled to all possessions I have adored

I feel pressure
I feel the pressure

And all the faded bones
Piling up high and low
Returning to life once you can stand alone

Don't get too close this time
The depths of love haunt you
It's dark inside where all my demons hide

I feel pressure
I feel the pressure

Waiting with patience of eons
Your presence fades into a memory
Underneath a cloud of silence, you journey into the rift
Will time defy the weight of you leaving us

I feel pressure
I feel the pressure

Hold aggression
Hold aggression

// Sickle And Peace //

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace

Please excuse the madness
Of the situation I am in
Are we only united
For we both share the cause of this

You choose to apply logic
It's hard to ply where there is none
My detonation's unknown
Allow the man to walk in his shoes from here

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

Justifying all your control
I cease to mourn what never could be
No feeling's ever final
Just another scar I wear and hold dear

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

Falling down and losing ground
Save me from myself
All I've seen and all I know
I've not been this low

Now I stand up on my own
Learning from myself
Where I've been and where I'll go
Still remains unknown

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

// More Than I Could Chew //

Will there ever be a moment I won't feel this heat coming up from ground?
Will there ever be a time when I can show myself through open doors?
All I need is you to tell me how to reconcile this guilt and shame
I've already ripped myself to pieces and I've given it away

All the weight lies upon my shoulders from
The great disruption
It's hard to breathe inside these waves of doubt
Tidal distraction

Can you tell me how to wish away this chaos making my head spin?
Can you tell me how to soothe the savage beast locked up inside these walls?
Will there ever be a place that I can hide and heal these open sores?
Or do I have to cut them out and eat them as my people adore?

All the weight lies upon my shoulders from
The great disruption
It's hard to breathe inside these waves of doubt
Tidal distraction

I have, I have lost my way
Reaching, reaching for today
I have, I have lost my way
Reaching, reaching for today

Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back

// The Beast //

I'm out of my mind
Pictures of past lives
Trapped in a memory
In fragments of time
The way things used to be
Find a better way to get back home
Reaching for something new
That's just not there anymore
'Cause you know that it's gone

You slip away to the distance
Pass a crack of light in the floor
I hear the sound of mischief
As the promising light shines some more
I paid you in fool's gold, and I don't owe you anymore
And I deserve nothing I find
Like a mountain of pain on the floor

Losing ground
Taken by a prophecy
Siren sounds
Calling for your sanctity
Wipe away
The blood from your face

All I see is our demise
Headed for the blackened skies
And I need more time

I still hear
The beast is breathing
Should I fall upon my sword?
Make sure they know
That I fought for them
Make sure they know
They know I tried
I scraped and clawed
I gave my all

Stars in the distance
Oh how they tell a story of my life
And tell us to beware
Repeating the past
Nature is nocturnal and that is that

I spend my days underground covered in ash and smothered in dirt
And you know how it hurts this little clown
Pay no attention to the sound of the beast
'Cause you know it can't hurt you when you're with me

// Skeleton Of Splendor //

You reached two hands outward
Two birds spreading our wings
Today's arms turn numb
When I turn it inward

We live and breathe all your thousand words
Now you sleep, we'll finish your work

To my detriment
To my detriment
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment

You painted us with effort
Always praising us high
The day has come to face the storm
As lightning strikes me in two

We live the dream onward as it were
Endless days we'll carry on as one

There's no doubt of what we're here to do
You laid it out
A promise of yourself

To my detriment
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment

To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment
(I forge ahead unscarred)
To my detriment

// Teardrinker //

Within a bruised heart
I'll just say when
Just one time before
It will come again
Little voice inside
Inside my head
Tell me when it's time to turn around again

All appears to fade away

I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to thinkâ¯about the damage I have done

Try to give up what weighs
What weighs you down
The only control you have
Is all your own
Do I fit the pieces
Together again
Or do I leave them lying on the floor?

All appears to fade away

I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to thinkâ¯about the damage I have done

Leaving you behind
Is the hardest thing I've done
Asking where did I go wrong?
I wonder what all of this makes
Does fortune favor the bold?
I only know that leaving you
Was the hardest thing
To cut and run

I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to thinkâ¯about the damage I have done

// Pushing The Tides //

I think I'm ready to start
I thought I heard you scream
We're all part of this fucked up devastation
(Go!)
Always spinning the wheels
A greater vision in sight
It's not failure if you're trying

Another prick of a thorn
The body reaches deep
As I choke the situation
Seeming clever and wise
Clouded beyond the dark cells
I know not what drips inside me

Pushing the tides
Trying not to go down and taken under
Pushing the tides
Try to keep my head above the water

(Go!)
You try untying the weight
And you continue to breathe
I remove you for protection
And where to go from here
A place you value the most
Such a brilliant realization

Pushing the tides
Trying not to go down and taken under
Pushing the tides
Try to keep my head above the water
Pushing the tides
Leading us to prevail
And all we desire
Pushing the tides
With every ounce of strength I have

// Peace And Tranquility //

The night I went under
And there was no one around
Nothing to swim to
Not the sky, not the ground
I heard you speak to me
And said to, "Just go down"

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

And I keep on waiting
For someone to save me
I keep waiting for someone to ask me, "What is your name?"

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

I've seen worse before
I've had trouble breathing
I've had scrapes and scars
Healing from lacerations

Bending from days on end
I get up and walk away

Through all the lies I told before
Well now, they've all come true
Never mind this screaming in the cold

And when I caught a glimpse of you
You were laughing at me and looking away
And I did everything I could
To try to get you to stay

I pass through dimensions
And leaving this plane
Turning into the ether
It changes everything

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

I can't hear at all
I've had trouble speaking
Will this heal my heart?
Relive the never-ending
Bending for days on end
I'll get up and walk away

// Dagger //

I cannot bare to believe that you have left this Earth
I couldn't stare as they covered you up with dirt and left

With all the best intent
And all your eloquence

The price we paid to know you

Your smile is stretching from the stars
I am still standing here in solace

I sense the writhing
Peeling off your skin
As the coals burn
We'll walk on fire

The lines you carved remain
Too many days to remember
Too many times have I tried

The price we paid to know you
The price we paid to know you

A dark shadow was cast with your departure
Now dig our way out from this mudslide and survive

With all the best intent
And all your eloquence

The price we paid to know you

Projecting light from beyond
We stare until the bruises soften

Never will there
Be another you
As the Sun turns
We hold you tighter

The final curtain calls
How many ways you brought pleasure
How many nights you brought to life

The price we paid to know you
The price we paid to know you

// Had It All //

A thousand lights in the night
Alone in the spectrum
On this sand, I find
And realize

The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're going to make it

Enduring the tireless fight
Death in slow motion
I'm growing tired of this scene
Echoes in your past

The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna to make it

// Savage Lands //

Running from an endless source of everlasting light
Stumble into darkness of my own creation
Navigate this maze of self-destruction's inner glow
Worship at the feet of primal gods of chaos

The walls we create
The cracks will begin to show
And watch them start to fall

All is indefinite
How quickly we evaporate
To memories and only dreams

As the seismic shifts
Veering into unknown space
Where monuments will bare your name

Drinking from reflections in the pool of endless doubt
Continue on the path of reckless devastation
In the pit of death and bones and carcasses decayed
It's here I find a guiding hand to true salvation

Push through the pain
Developing calloused hands
To dig, scrape, and claw

Thought and visions stick
The images, how they still burn
Cementing of your legacy

Now it's flooding back
Trigger the unlocking fate
To wash away and letting free

Dredging the weight
Dragging through hollow ground
To break the chain of lies

'Round and 'round, we battle ourselves
Silencing our tongues

// Gobblers Of Dregs //

Long and frayed
Static surrounds us
Break the free fall
Safely land

When man can climb to see
His rejection
Spirit'll burn
Evaporate

I left you in the wind
To pull the scraps together
I'm the one who sinned
There's more for me to weather

Complications
Of loss and of gain
The grace he gave
Is filling the void

How to proceed
With new direction
As photographs
Melt away

I left you in the wind
To pull the scraps together
I'm the one who sinned
There's more for me to weather

Waiting
For the Sun to rise
So I can
Say my last goodbye

All that I needed from you was your warm embrace
Turns out
That was mine to give

Fools play into broken plans
Tuned straight
From servants' hand

Reaping
Ill-gotten gains
Bleeding
This love away

Coming
Home to rescue me
The fate of man resides in empathy

Seems my foundation is shaking and giving way
Look for my hand reaching up from this rubble and clay

It's too late
My hearts away
It's too late
Reborn again

I left you in the wind
To pull the scraps together
I'm the one who sinned
There's more for me to weather

// Eyes Of Serpents //

All eyes forward
See what's to be done
Calloused as I am becoming
Less and less of my own
If I burn the bridges
Leaving the ash behind
There's no choice but to move on

Within a heartbeat the dream is dead
All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping

Circles I've broken
Once, they seemed so clear
Leaving the past I buried
Deep in yesteryear

This will bring back memories
That I don't want anymore
Always see reminders
And now I close the door

The illusion's gone, the end is here

All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping
If I could crawl beneath the earth and settle with the worms and dirt
I'd steal the eyes of serpents soothing powers from the deep blue sea

Is this just our fortune or unexpected fate?
A betterment for all

The trials we made are troubling, they smother me
Lay me bare to dry

Begging me to call it quits and go for broke
Bury me as I fall

To treat you as a part of me, it hollows you
The story has to fold

// Gigantium //

I wish I could run forever
Not concerned if I am found
I wish I had all the answers
I wish I knew what went wrong

Whatever you say is too late
Speak it before you run
Waiting is just a mistake

I just need you to whisper
Tell me all is well
You deserve to be happy
Not stuck knee deep in hell

Whatever you say is too late
Speak it before you run
Waiting is just a mistake
It pains me to see you this way
To erase you is what I fear
You're swimming through my head
It keeps you near

But all we said was too late
Still, you intend to run
Chasing another mistake
It pains me to see you this way
To erase you is what I fear
You're swimming through my head
It keeps you near

My love, so strong
Washing the dirt away
As the snakes all go to their holes

My love, so strong
Bathing in turpentine
Until the flesh and bone come undone

My love, so strong
Deflecting the thoughts of strangers
To reach the other side

My love, so strong
The mountains we made in the distance
Those will stay with us
