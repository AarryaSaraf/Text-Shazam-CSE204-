Album: Remission

// Crusher Destroyer //

Lesson
the honoring instinct of animal
pressure
no blame on the red bull
throw fury at him

aim gorge and win

less contenders on the way today
let them pay
nothing lost
nothing gained

listen
here lies the warning for matador
blackout
blood running the dirt floor
won't bleed by accident

burn your game plan

// March Of The Fire Ants //

As passion encircles the daily storm
the heart bleeds and droughts do not

bone grave
bone engraved
stone grave
stone engraved

all circles created with intention
an ocean turns yellow
it soothes the eye

// Where Strides The Behemoth //

Condition tomorrow
with visions inlaid
the priest stands to our right
a princess is mine

the regress of some minds
further chase the prize
pretentious you follow
religion is mine

anger precedes my footsteps
haunting past comes into head
horizon seems so far away
this life close to end of days
kill and i will be damned
forgive and i will be free

unified eyesight
grow

// Workhorse //

Slaved into brittle and worked for days
only thing that paves your stay
look behind you see what you've made
like a workhorse stands for miles
work for you and never get tired
roll 'em up it's time to go
we'll be back before it's too long

shaved into rhythm
work for days
consequences we have paid
to be free in a world we've made
like a workhorse stands for miles
work for you and never get tired
roll 'em up it's time to go
we can bet on all that's lost
before it's too long

burning hell

// Ole' Nessie //

Sanction lived in
taught by masters
flight of giving
be mine always
here for duration
miss my sweet love
times of sailing
keep me grounded
make us sure of future sanctions

// Burning Man //

Coals under foot burst into flames
become the earth's ashes
remain
awaiting sand
a burning man

approach the door where i place blame
take the first step
cleansing my shame
awaiting sand
a burning man

// Trainwreck //

Life's changed
yet remain the same
basking in an afterglow
i did not know
i am here
in shadows island

lying
hopeless wondering
all questions exhaust me

running screaming chanting
for all this land I've seen its worth
helping all for times sake
it brings me work
pinned to this world

// Trampled Under Hoof //

Birth
original plan
who will issue days and strike them
hurry to mystic plains
go

lifesblood

hurdle in the path
struck down
all is clear for play

// Trilobite //

If you can't get it
i can't get it
fly
soul is single
wind beneath us
i can't take it
if you can't take it
fly
soul is single
wind beneath us

shades of sixteen
you're with me
shades of sixteen
remember

// Mother Puncher //

Change stand grow
these things you'll never be
taste your fate
all that you'll ever be
a life love unconditional
a life love
love unconditional

chase
chase 'em down string 'em up
hate
hate the ones who bring you down
