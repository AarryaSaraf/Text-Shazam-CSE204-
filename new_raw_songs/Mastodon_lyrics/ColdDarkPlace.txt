// North Side Star //

North side star's coming on down
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
West side is coming on down
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you

The countdown's begun
The world is ending
Where are we now?
And what have we done?
And how will I know?
That you are the one

It's getting cold outside
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
North star has fallen to the ground
It rolls back the eyes around you
All around you
West side is coming on down
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you

The countdown's begun
The world is ending
Where are we now?
And what have we done?
And how will I know?
That you are the one

You and I
We could expire
Right here and now
Wouldn't matter at all

I can't clean this blood off my hands
I can't get the stains out, I tried
But maybe if we look ahead
We can clear this wreck to the side

You and I
We could expire
Right here and now
Wouldn't matter at all

The world starts beginning to slow
Rust and bone come up from the ground
Come here and disguise me as love
Death has been shattered from sun

// Blue Walsh //

As we hang from the vine
We swam on the thin red line
I'm asleep in the deep
Asleep in the dark black sea

I call out your name
All I hear is the pouring rain
When you came into view
I realise it's not you

You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam

'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
'Cause I waited so long

The night fades away
I'm dipped in the deep dark clay
And I'm raising my voice
Sinking with all my teeth

I'm hiding the storm
The storm with the bright green glow
And I'm holding my knife
It's sure to make them leave

You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam

'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
When the wait is so long

Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy
Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy

'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
'Cause I waited so long
To watch it all leave
When the wait is so long

// Toe To Toes //

I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles

For our sake
I will wait for you

I walk alone, into the darkness
I came toe to toe and face to face with the beast
He knew me by my name, it was surprising
He knew everything about me that I despised

I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles

He had gold, He had silver
He had all the women and wine that you'll ever need
Just one thing, a prick of your finger
Spell your name in the sand and do it with your own blood

Bitten by the fangs of circumstance
Outward light a reflection
We are all evil
Underneath the slab of material
Mutable ways of my fortune
Bitten by my fangs

Gave me a smile
Gave me a whisper
Lay me down in linens
To watch me sleep
I played the fool
I played the sinner
I played the part of me that no one wanted to see

// Cold Dark Place //

I love your face and the things that you do
Make me warm sometimes when I'm away
I guess you'd say that at the end of the day
You'll be the only person here that exists

You left my heart in some cold dark place
Where your love grows on a vine and I see it all the time
I didn't mean a word that I said
When I was lying to your face about being alone

I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I've gone away forever
I've gone away

I reach out to touch you baby
You're not there
You reach out to hold my hand
Please don't you dare

'Cause I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I've gone away forever
I've gone away

I reach out to hug you baby
You're not around
You reach out to kiss my face
Please not right now

What can I say that hasn't been said before
One hundred times before you took the dog
And I wish I knew how to breathe again
I fear I'm gonna die inside my skin

This has gotta be the last time that we fight
Or go at each other's throats
Will you go, as I want to mend?
