Album: CallOfTheMastodon

// Shadows That Move //

The us rhythm blows a diseased river flow
Yeah it's going to blow a change within you
The us rhythm blows
With change we'll explode
And live

// Welcoming War //

Lost in a world
A guided eye to strengthen weakness
Throat in noose pain
Feel it constricting a lost love
Welcome to war
And it grows
Ocean lure
Fire of mankind
Universe
Throw it away
Destroyer of worlds found pain
Welcome to war
And it grows

// Thank You For This //

Let's throw down the love
I catch eyes open far and wide
Ability
It's intense
Golden
Lace it fills the magic flies
I wonder where is this list
Give in next time
This will be a blast
Ability
It's intense
Golden
Lace it fills the magic flies
I wonder where is this list

// We Built This Come Death //

Now you see all this time
Work nine to five
Monday through Friday I'm singing
I sing the blues for you
Now I'm standing in the pouring rain
My feet are cold but I cant complain
And I wonder how you have been
I need you love I miss you so
I know it's right but it's always strange
How I scream
All this life's worth all the while
Heartache and slave driving pain
I sing the blues for you
Now I'm standing in the pouring rain
My feet are cold but I can't complain
And I wonder how you have been
I need you love I miss you so
I know it's right but it's always strange

// Hail To Fire //

All see light in oceans black
Go seek find the red seas fire
Blow ship by those sail blind
Choosing one loosing blood
You try exchanging
No I don't think so
Cannot escape me
No sound reason

// Battle At Sea //

Wage no war thou brutal sea
I laugh at you
You can't have me
You will calm and carry me
Wage no war thou brutal sea
Wage no war
Brutal sea
Laugh at you
Can't have me

// Deep Sea Creature //

Knowing right
Learning wrong
What you're feeling is pressure
Pulsate new blood
I've seen things you've heard never before
Bones aged in dust
Buy your bite take the body
Calm
Shutting down
You built me
I knew it
I'll never lie liar
You fed me
I chewed it
I'll never lie liar
I follow you covering me
Spirits in pieces
Crumbled and burnt

// Slickleg //

Slickleg!
Praise mammoth
I lie trapped in ice
Bright cold shield my eyes
White cruel stone
Can't move
Hide so far from truth
Blood floweth
Crawl into unknown
Does time heal all wounds
Why's this been so long
Line of descent gone
Reign down
Reign down

// Call Of The Mastodon //

Strong structures guide
Building high and wide
Minds that create make us feel more alive
Standing on top of the skyline
Unlock unleash the beast below
