// A Commotion //

It flickered to light
It turned broke what was right
Got the roots by the hair
What was no longer there
It blocked out the sun
It climbed up the stairs
And then it slipped through the cracks
I wasn't watching my back

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart

It stalked through the rooms
And then it tore the sheets off the bed
It ripped the books off the shelf
It turned heaven to hell
It held me down tight
It took all my fight
It broke all the windows
It came flame from the kindle

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart, the grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heart
The grudge has still got your heart

// A Spoonful Weighs A Ton //

And though they were sad
They rescued everyone
They lifted up the Sun
A spoonful weighs a ton

Giving more than they had
The process had begun
A million came from one
The limits now were none

Being drunk on their plan
They lifted up the Sun

Forcing it off with their hands
The trap door came undone
Above our heads it swung
The privilege had been won

Being drunk on their plan
They lifted up the Sun

Yelling as hard as they can
The doubters all were stunned
Heard louder than a gun
The sound they made was love

// Cut You Up With A Linoleum Knife //

Don't talk, watch
Don't talk, watch
You came here, watch it
Don't like it? Walk out
We still have all your fucking money

Do not nudge, kick, or jiggle the seat in front of you
I am sitting there
I am everywhere at once
And I will cut you up

If you make out here
I will cut your lips and tongue from your head with a
Linoleum knife

Do not explain the plot
If you don't understand, then you should not be here
Your money is now our money
And we will spend it on drugs

Do not crinkle your food wrappers loudly
Be considerate to others
Or I will bite your torso
And give you a disease

Did you bring your baby?
Babies don't watch this
Take the seed outside
Leave it in the streets
Run over it after the show

If I see you video-taping this movie
Satan will rain down your throat with hot acid
And dissolve your testicles and turn your guts into snakes

This is a copyrighted movie for Time Warner
If I find that you've sold it on ebay
I will break into your house
And tear your wife in half

// Fallen Torches //

Bring forth the enemy
Let him beg for his life
Bring forth the enemy
I want his neck on the knife
Incinerate the figurehead
I plan to erase you first
Flooded rain slathering
Bringing what you deserve

Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Bad ways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out

Find me the remedy
Searching the ends of the earth
Bring me the entity
Snuff out the light in his eyes
Eliminate, obliterate
The image in my sight
Bring me the head, bring me the head
Finish and erase

Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Bad ways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out

The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground

Another living travesty
A never-ending game
Fear is the leash you shake

Free
Bring me in
Heal my heart
Break my hands

What a lesson, God
Be in my heart
Be in my heart
And when I love anew
Let it be true
Let me shield
I need to leave the shadow

The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground

Guard the station
Mark the station
Down

// Forged By Neron //

All beneath the foot of man abed of oil and bone
A stampede where I may roam
As we swallow into earth's mouth of muck and mire
I rescue me from myself

Anywhere but here
Anyplace with a pale blue sky
Anywhere but here
All the signs tell me to fly

Come to reason where the land is dry and bones decay
A new guidance will be found
And you'll see the message in the tar of all I said
Reckless spirit lead the way

Anywhere but here
Anyplace with a pale blue sky
Anywhere but here
All the signs tell me to fly

Save your weak and dying
Save your own
Save your weak and dying
Bring them home

// Just Got Paid //

I just got paid today,
Got me a pocket full of change.
Said, I just got paid today,
Got me a pocket full of change.
If you believe like workin' hard all day,
Just step in my shoes and take my pay.

I was born my papa's son,
When I hit the ground I was on the run.
I had one glad hand and the other behind.
You tear up yours, just give me mine.
When the hound dog barks in the black of the night,
Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right.

I just got paid today,
Got me a pocket full of change.
Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool?
Yes, I do, man, my bag is full.
It's the root of evil and you know the rest
But it's way ahead of what's second best

// Rufus Lives //

Get me out of this place
Get me out of this atmosphere
Let me go and I'll never see your face no more
Death is running the race
Demon come for the ride
And the hounds of hell are close behind

Clearing out the old
Make way for the new
Leave our separate ways
Lay waste to you

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road

Get us out of the light
Go beyond the horizon
It's the only chance we have if we want to survive
Burning into the night
Trying to get out of underground
Say goodbye to the sulfur and the fire

We have got to believe
Vow to never return
Drag you off your knees
Lay waste to none

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road

// Stairway To Heaven //

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Ohh

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

// The Bit //

This is for cows 
It's not for the size of me 
Into my mouth 
Nine hundred and fourteen 
Try some force try to lead 
The foundling die is close determinate 
Raise head and stomp the blood 
I'm not even sound raid 

I'm alive I got the silver 
And I wonder what will you follow? 
When your head is not in order 
And I'm stomping your little 

How can you laugh 
How can you lie awake 
Making me drive 
Making my heart a 
Not too fat not to lean 
The foundling die is close excitedly 
Raise head and stomp the blood 
I'm not even soundly

// White Walker //

Will them White Walkers?
Will them all dead?
Then come on an winter
They come on in winter
Here rebel soul to shred
Hear rebel soul to shred
Hide away your children
Then hide away yourself
Dig deep into mountain
Dig far beyond the spell

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall

You can hear their footsteps
Crush the fresh-felt snow
You can hear them fiesting
Oh, tell me where's my crow
Harping every armory
Sharpening their blade
I pray for every one of them
And sacrifices made

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall

So we're waiting [?]
We're waiting [?]
Hiding inside the [?] for winter has come

They come down
They come down the Wall
They come down
They come down the Wall
To save our souls
To save our souls
