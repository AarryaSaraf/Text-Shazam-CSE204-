// Been To The Mountain //

I got nothing to prove, I got nothing to sell
I'm not buying what you've got, I ain't ringing no bells
I got a mint in my pocket, got a bullet in my teeth
I'm going straight in the fire, I'm gonna talk to the high priest
Used to be a lover, queen and a drifter
A cowboy devil, a bride in a box, and
A pilgrim and a thief, but it was me underneath
I just know who I'm not and that's alright with me
Alright, alright

Can't tell me nothing babe, and that's a fact
I have been to the mountain and back, oh yeah

Well, I wish I was God, but I'm glad that I'm not
'Cause I think too much, got my head in a knot
The world's on fire, better save your brother
I've been a child and I've been a mother
I've been a victim and I've been a tumor
Used to be your waitress but now I'm a consumer
I've been on food stamps, I've been outta my mind
I rolled in dirty dollars, stood in the welfare line

I've been a number, I've been under attack
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright

I've been a dancer, a saint, an assassin
I've been a nobody, a truck-driver shaman
So many seasons that I've been adrift
Sometimes I've wondered if I even exist

Do you ever walk down the street and do you think to yourself
Am I being watched, man? Am I on the list? Well
I been called every name in the book, honey, go on, take your best shot
Take your best shot, take your best shot, and I got my back to the gun you
Aim at my heart, go on, take your best shot, now
I am the hunter and I am the hunted
I am a baby, I'm wanted
I'm an alchemist, teacher, I'm a sinner, I'm a preacher
And I know that there's more here than this
As I stare in the void of the black mountain vacuum
I know the scent of death like a perfume, no, this ain't the end
This ain't the end, this ain't the end, this ain't the end
Ooh, take off your tired eyes, undress your goodbyes 'cause
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright

Can't tell me nothing babe, and that's a fact
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright
Alright

// Light Me Up //

I can tell your mind is changing
From the worry in your eye
Lord knows you've been trying
While your life goes speeding by
Empty bottles full of time
Green and blue just like your worried eyes

I wake up and reach for you
In the middle of the night
Paranoid by cryptic dreams
That left me so uptight
If the world turns out your light
Honey it will always be alright
Right
Be alright
Alright

Light me up burn me up
Boil from the inside
Deeper than the ocean
Get me higher than the tide
Take me down shake the ground
Make the world explode
Rivers quake levees break
Make the wind blow

Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow

Words are just a shadow of a figure that we speak
Spoken like an echo we're so willing to repeat
Let your voice be silent I just want to see you come
Seeing me on the fortnight when the day is done
I went to sleep on a bed of nails and I woke up in chains
I'm sad when the sun is out but I'm happy when it rains

Light me up burn me up
Boil from the inside
Deeper than the ocean
Get me higher than the tide

Take me down shake the ground
Make the world explode
Rivers quake levees break
Make the wind blow

Tell me things I don't know

// Radio //

I think I need to take some time out
And I wanna turn my phone off
I Just wanna be alone
Just let me be alone today
I'm saving all my extra money
Go out get what they'd never buy me
Why do I feel so sick and tired
I'm sick and tired every day

People try to push me around
Run my name straight in the ground
I can't hear them I tuned them out
And I turned them way down low
The only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio

Don't get confused about how I feel
Don't let them fool you about what is real
I think the whole world's going crazy
And it makes us look insane
But all this thinking makes my head hurt
And all this running makes my feet hurt
I work my back right off my shirt
Kick off my shoes and run away

People try to push me around
Change my face and change my sound
I can't hear them I tuned them out
And I turned them way down low
The only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio

// Change Of Heart //

One of these days
You're gonna wake up older
With a hole in your pocket
And a blade on your shoulder
Well if you break both your legs
Don't come runnin' to me
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Don't worry about the war
Nobody's winning
Don't worry about the rain
It's only beginning
I never loved you
And I always will
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Get down to the end of the line
When it all fell apart
I quit trying to change your mind
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Where are you now
In your pile of rubble
You run from danger
Straight into trouble
Way down deep
You're just as shallow as me
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

An unwanted child
With an absent mother
You want protection
Like an older brother
I end up forgetting
All the words that you said
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Get down to the end of the line
And it all fell apart
I quit trying to change the past
I had a change of heart, oh
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Oohhhh, oohhh, oohhh
Oohhhh, oohhh, oohhh
Oohhhh

// County Road //

Hey kid where ya goin' with those brand new wheels you got
You think you're gonna last forever forever says you're not
Won't ya take me down this gravel road and out a little ways
Forget about this prison town and these goddamn summer days
Ever since you went away well it's gotten bad 'round here
Sometimes I wanna see it burn in my rear-view mirror
You're so lucky you made it out and you don't even know
But I still see your car driving up and down County road
County road
County road

I've got this joint let's go get high and shoot a little dice
I'll pour some gin you can buy me in oh wouldn't that be nice
Ever since the storm came through well there's not much left to save
Developers they bought your house they're gonna tear it down in May
I keep waking up from this nightmare dream time cuts like a knife
I wish I could have back what I didn't know were the best years of my life
Maybe I'm lucky I'm already dead and I don't even know
But I still see your headlights runnin' through the trees out on County road
County road

Remember when we got drunk that time in Ontario
Listening to Warren Zevon on the stereo
I keep thinking 'bout that very last night when we went down to the bar
And even though you're no longer here you'll never be that far
Hey kid you know it's been three years since the change
The band broke up the boys don't talk and the city's rearranged
No one's lucky and no one's saved and no one really knows
Why it was you who had to go down like that out on County road
County Road
Why it was you
Why it was you

// Time Machine //

I get lost in the conversation
Remembering a memory with you
Boredom drives my imagination
Into places I never knew

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

When did this all go so wrong
I gave you everything
Been waiting around for so long
Nothing is ever going to change

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

I want to ride in a time machine

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

I want to ride in a time machine
I want to ride in a time machine

// Hell In The Heartland //

When I woke up this morning
Something wasn't right
If the truth amounts to nothing
Guess we lost the fight
We've been building something intangible
All we had was faith
Some days I wanna destroy it all
Watch it blow away

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything I want

Ain't it hard to see yourself
When you're looking in the mirror
I'm a hazard to my health
What's behind me isn't clear
Maybe I finally got too high
Now I'm coming down
My mind is like a crooked house
That's burning to the ground

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything I want

In my heart there's a hole
Twice the size of God
Try to fill it up with so many things
But still I just feel lost
Can't please 'em all all the time
And who would want to fake it
Love gets you hurt
Being real gets you hated

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything

// Anytime You Call //

When you walk out on the street
And get shot down by the sun's angry heat
People staring bullet holes in the back of your head
Making you feel much worse than dead
When your skin feels like a cage
And all the good times just seem to be erased
Lonely madness seems to boil inside of you
Like a thief that steals your every move

Anytime you call
I will answer you
You can't find one single friend
I'll come through

We're not as stable as we seem
One small gust of wind could knock down every dream
Frail bodies torn minds and soft hearts exposed
Hidden under our ragged dirty clothes
You've still got that devil grin
Two eyes like searchlights peering out and looking in
Even though you feel like you've got nothing you could show
You've given me more than you could know

Anytime you call
I will answer you
You can't find one single friend
I'll come through

I'll come through
I'll come through
I'll come through
I'll come through

// Lydia //

At the clinic wondering what your face would be like
Mascara bleeding to my eyes
Tied like a dog on a chain with a midlife crisis and an ex husband
Sneaking a Marlboro Ultra Light I stole from a nurse out there in the alley
Halfway home is where the heart is and I'm halfway home

White trash, trailer trash, they said you'd always be it
And you said, 'one day you'll see.'
But lately you start to wonder if they were right
Spit on you at school outside
In the locker room and bathroom too
Locked you in the stall
Bless this mess, can I bum a light?

The cars out on the LA Freeway they look like red and light Christmas lights strung out on a chain
The ex virgin Mary of 49th street has a pocket full of pills
She sold herself for synthetic heroin and sleeping with a man about twice her age
Really though it was anything but sleeping

Nice neighbors, bad cough
No health insurance this year, transitional neighborhood
Gentrification comes like it always does and some nice condos they go in
But the needles in the alley they're still laying there
Don't go barefoot or take a nap out there
Wear shoes if you have um
Undercover methadone clinic
Children close your eyes

Say a lullaby and think of a nursery rhyme
Or maybe something your mama used to tell you when you were trying to sleep
Jill fell down when the bow breaks oh the cradle will fall
Down will come baby, down will come baby, down will come baby
Put out the cigarette
Just make a decision Lydia, just make a decision
It's yours

Close your eyes and make a wish
Hear the whisper of God
He used to talk like you, you used to see his face in the clouds
Now I see your face in my mind
It's wrong for him to want it
Bless this mess, brush your hair
Fix yourself up real nice you've got a show tonight

Singing down at the Broken Bottle, half waiting shifts
Get the guys a couple of beers, go on get the food, living off tips and meth
Then I came home after dancin' one night
And I wrecked my car and you have to take the bus now so you've got a long walk to think about it
A long walk to the station
A long life ahead to live with yourself
So think about it Lydia
Think about it Lydia
Think about it Lydia

// Landfill //

I could build a landfill of dreams I deserted
Swallowed up like muscadine wine
I look for the stray wolves out in the distance
They lick their lips on the timberline
Garbage and the ash keep piling up
A catastrophe that is yours and mine
They say it takes time to become timeless
Time is all I've got this time

Once in a while you stop to notice
Something that's been there from the start
I made love and love made me
But only love can tear you apart

The sahara winds blew all the dust in
Little white birds like shells in the sand
No one tells you when you're young you have so much to lose
Until you watch it slip through your hands
I put myself in my own painting
Those mournful blues and a blood red rose
Know the picture's always changing
You can't change how the story goes

Once in a while you stop to notice
Something that's been there from the start
I made love and love made me
But only love can tear you apart
Only love can tear you apart
Love
