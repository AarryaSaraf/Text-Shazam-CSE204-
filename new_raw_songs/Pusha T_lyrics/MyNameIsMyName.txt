Album: MyNameIsMyName

// King Push //

This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For 11 years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference 'tween me and Hova

But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!

// Numbers On The Boards //

(Yeah!)
How you feelin'? (Fine!)
You feel alright?

I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me (Yeah!)
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys (Y'all feel like dancâ)
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga (Y'all feel like dancâ)
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see, they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound (Yeah!)
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come, a hundred goin' overboard (Yeah!)
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow-for-blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt you, Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw (Y'all feel like dancâ)
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gym stars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free-throw (Yeah!)

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
Mix drug and show money, "Biggs" Burke on tour (Yeah!)
Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards (Yeah!)
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors (Yeah!)
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doin' dirt like it's Earth DayâGod!

(Y'all feel like dancâ)
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
(Y'all feel like dancâ)

// Sweet Serenade //

[Chris Brown:]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Pusha T:]
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chris Brown:]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night

Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

[Pusha T:]
Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (woo!)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (woo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (woo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Woo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces

Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

[Chris Brown:]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life

[Pusha T:]
Look, my Ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload

Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

[Chris Brown:]
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life

// Hold On //

[Pusha T:]
I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the FÃ¼hrer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

[Rick Ross:]
I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

[Rick Ross (Pusha T) {Together}:]
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
(I got you, my nigga, hold on)
(I got you, my nigga, hold on)
(If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on)
(By the end of this song), {I got you, my nigga, hold on}
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on

// Suicide //

[Pharrell:]
Yeah... I just ordered one, my nigga
Yeah

[Pusha T:]
I'm still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I'm still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to 'em, I ain't talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain't a Libra either
I'm just a name and a number with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers, you been leeching
Been Baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer, pound sign, been triller
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas, you Zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

Big difference between a renter and a homeowner
Hip-Hop Weekly cover and a Rolling Stoner
Lufthansa I heist, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers 'cause they in their moment
Might have crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal 'cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the Bible don't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scenes that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn's only purpose is completely suicidal
Ooh! Suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

[Ab-Liva:]
Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top five, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
'Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I unmaster
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it falls like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, nigga, brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

[Pusha T:]
When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

// 40 Acres //

[The-Dream:]
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

[Pusha T:]
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses
Push

[The-Dream:]
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

[Pusha T:]
Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'
Thirty-five years of marriage and my mamma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him?
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big Willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby, now he's transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!

[The-Dream:]
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

// No Regrets //

[Kevin Cossom:]
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ah

[Pusha T:]
Say hi to the bad guy, say ah to the champagne
Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
(Woo!) They see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my mamma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way

[Kevin Cossom:]
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ah

[Jeezy:]
Mamma had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back, can't you tell?
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sport cars, Italian leather, Princess Cut with baguettes
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
No regrets

[Kevin Cossom:]
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ah

[Pusha T:]
Presidential, I came back, April showers, I rains back
Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black
Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here
Mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got that by the square (Woo!)
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there
How you acting like I ain't here? D-Boy and I pioneer

[Kevin Cossom:]
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ah

// Let Me Love You //

[Kelly Rowland:]
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

[Pusha T:]
Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

[Kelly Rowland:]
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

[Pusha T:]
Hey mama, come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1, V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn, them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here

[Kelly Rowland:]
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

[Pusha T:]
Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother's CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It's only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I'm from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all 'cause the money don't last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don't ask"

[Kelly Rowland:]
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

// Who I Am //

[Pusha T]
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

They said be all you can be, nigga
They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving 'em

Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said the truth set you free

[2 Chainz:]
Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

[Pusha T:]
Woooh! They said be all you can be

[Big Sean:]
Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they role, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

[Pusha T:]
They said the truth set you free!

Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

Woooh! I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends

// Nosetalgia //

W-W-W-What is it?

[Pusha T:]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying â dead, yuugh!

[Samples:]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change, ch-ch-change"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it

[Samples:]
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"

// Pain //

[Future:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, baby girl, gold chains

I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing
Getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same
We the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain

[Pusha-T:]
Eighteen-wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money, screaming, "Encore!"
Spending nights with a prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the Feds knock at your door

[Future:]
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

[Pusha-T:]
Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Yuugh! This is drug dealer brilliance

Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push: my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead, I chose Avon
Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)
It's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

[Future:]
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

[Pharrell Williams:]
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Pusha T:]
Now when the phone start to clickin', your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but that man won't let go
Oh, my nigga, say it ain't so
Now we speakin' on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearin' whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Givin' you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standin' up
I never thought I'd had have to question, 'Were you man enough?'
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Tellin' all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

[Pharrell Williams:]
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are lookin' through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Pusha T:]
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writin's on the walls
It's like I hear you smilin' when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was sayin' on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointin' fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightnin' then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak sayin'

[Pharrell Williams:]
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Pusha T:]
Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitchin' you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is gettin' stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facin', once he told me that

[Pharrell Williams:]
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
