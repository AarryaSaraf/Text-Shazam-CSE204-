Album: KingPushDarkestBeforeDawnThePrelude

// Intro //

Espera, ven aquÃ­, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mÃ­o. You gotta pick one, daddy

Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor

I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards

I done been black balled
And never gave a fuck 'cause I'm Jack Frost
Of sellin' that blast off

I'm on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I'm my brother's keeper, Lord Willin', keep grindin'

As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin

The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it's murder was the case homie

I'm watching this three ring circus
Old lions don't roar, so the clowns ain't nervous
Even you fools serve purpose
Let 'em run amuck until the king resurface

Then it's off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you're dead
They take samples of 'em, I make examples of 'em
It's the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered

Ask 'Ye who's loyalty more realer
Ask P, who's core's a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it's gonna kill 'em
The only great I ain't made better was J. Dilla

Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!

A Pablito le dieron pa' bajo, but I'm still here, y el otro tipo? He's running, but I'm still here, I don't even know why you doing this loco, yo ni se pa' que, but always still right here. You wanna be like them, don't you huh? You're not like them... Y definitivamente, they're not like us

// Untouchable //

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Lyrically I'm, untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it's getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can't you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I'm aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they're mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin' pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling's open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It's a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain't nothin' rented
Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don't bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that don't bounce
The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that don't bounce
I'm in the score of these movies, I'm losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me '8 Mile' fame
Selling Eminem to him and 'em
White to the Blacks I'm a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let's talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix "Narcos"
Part on the side of my 'fro like I'm Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let's take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It's looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the JesÃºs, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I'm walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

[The Dream:]
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

[Pusha T:]
You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it's easy acting like Mitch
"Paid In Full" was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I'm drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don't believe in
You ask me, Tyga looking like a genius
I'm Kim Jong of the crack song
Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem
Woo, the revolution will be televised
'Cause we done see all and they telling lies

[The Dream:]
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

[Pusha T:]
You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it's easy being my bitch
It's only right for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist
The minimums, niggas ain't synonyms
Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn't know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ah, my living room rap scream crack money
I don't trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get rat from me

[The Dream:]
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

[Pusha T:]
Niggas talking it, but ain't living it
Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why I'm still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilÃ 
They say it's hate, but it's these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain't know, you got coached through it
Woo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Ha, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him
Yeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard
Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why I'm still here
I'm America's worst nightmare
Night, night nigga

[The Dream:]
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin' followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

// Crutches, Crosses, Caskets //

Yeah
Uh-huh
Beautiful evils
Yeah
Check me out

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
My young niggas sic' 'em
I don't get 'em
I just get back their jewelry if I'm fuckin' with 'em
Your man crush Mondays be owin' niggas
My skin is triple black, I'm the omen
You can't kill a God like the Romans, uh
Take my time to craft shit
'Cause I don't like back and forth with Puff about rap shit

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly
I'm Yasiel Puig, I'm in another league
I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rapper's mother lives in squalor?
Mildred's in the Bahamas for the month
She's probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Swordfish, my reality is more fish
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Ha imagine that, where you from nigga?

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magic's
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
The throwaway TECs got Tourettes
It's more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that's above money
This the ministry of street energy
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I'm the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims

// M.P.A. //

[The-Dream:]
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
I swear it's like a disease
That goes 'round and 'round and 'round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? 'Cause I'm anti everything
I swear it's like a disease
That goes 'round and 'round and 'round like sirens

[Kanye West & A$AP Rocky:]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Pusha T:]
The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that's most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don't let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn't ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what's the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won't unveil it yet, can't tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh

[Kanye West & A$AP Rocky:]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Pusha T:]
Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits
Now the Major League's where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can't judge you 'cause we ain't hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love 'em, make 'em spare no amount
Make 'em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you're worth it
Real bitches worth it

[Kanye West & A$AP Rocky:]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

[Pusha T:]
I've been watching all you real niggas
I done seen more won't than you will niggas
Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I'm in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it's honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It's no pictures, now you in your feelings
I'm a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

[Kanye West & A$AP Rocky:]
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

// Got 'Em Covered //

[Pusha T:]
The flow plays limbo courtesy of Timbo
Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget
I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can't touch it

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack's thrown
Back talk to your mamma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph 'til the pack gone
I relate to 'em
I'm a Pyrex God, shit I'm great to 'em
All of you little niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
Don't realize he a candle 'til he blow it
I gave y'all the game it's decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
It's all hustlin', so deja vu
Still a nigga unwrap bricks
I'ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

[Ab-Liva:]
Game too emo, I'm too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I'm so Pesci, too Casino
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go 'til it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines

Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

// Keep Dealing //

[Pusha T:]
They call him a crack dealer, I am like Warhol
A nigga paint a picture of a bullet for all y'all
Now crawl for him
My sophomore jinx is more minks
But only for my mother she'll use 'em as couch covers
You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends
If y'all can't swim in the deep end then watch nigga
Woo! 80,000 on this watch niggas
Yuugh! And I ain't never had to watch nigga
Rich or wealthy, pick your poison
I think I paid for one too many abortions
Another Celine, it's like a routine
It's like Ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans
Her new body's in my new body
Make her in an hourglass that's my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealing

Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though

The Robb Report of the snort
Kings hold court
Lawyers get bought
Palms get greased when them cases get fought
No felony what the fuck is you tellin' me
Reduced to simple assault
It cost to keep it hush-hush
It was just us
Ended up sellin' my Bat Mobile
The crash don't kill
It's how you survives it
Rebound on niggas, I nine live'd it
Couldn't miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches ain't respecting niggas not in full bloom
So the neck is full moon
I'm living a lie, she live for this life
And loving the Alaia pumps
Loving the rush, I'm living "The Wire" Uh
Drugs and this rap is really "Empire"
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealing ya

Talk numbers, but never talk 'em to me though
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain't talkin' to me though

[Beanie Sigel:]
Ten toes deep in the trap, nigga I'm good here
Feelin' like Tony reading words on the Goodyear
Big said, "Only the FEDs I should fear"
So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there
Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It's homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the "Thriller" vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I'm weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I'm Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his Pyrex
Get rich or die tryin' is my mindset
And spend it all until I'm swallowing dirt
'Cause I ain't never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse
I ain't never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain't never see a nigga swallow a bullet
And live to talk about it
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it
You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it
Nigga shit, that's how I lost three million
Luckily was somethin' in the ceiling, keep dealing ya

// Retribution //

[Pusha T:]
Now that you're focused
I'm glad that you noticed
The realest nigga here
It's kinda chilly being the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our "Otis"
Now witness the chosen
It's just different here
Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice
Play in paradise
All I know is white
Get the powder gone
Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass
They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last
I been preaching since money, cash-hoes

[Kehlani:]
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it's so hard to see you
Got money I've been different ever since
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don't know you
Who are you? We don't know you

[Pusha T:]
I'm the fire and the base
I'm admired by the greats
This to each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith
Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars
See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar
Who you know better with the raw?
Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit at that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule
Covered in white like I walked in the chapel
I'm that cold

[Kehlani:]
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it's so hard to see you
Got money I've been different ever since
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don't know you
Who are you? We don't know you

[Pusha T:]
The last dope dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
The mamas, they zombies
Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me
Woo, safe look like it got a printer
Ain't no rappers in that Sprinter
Ain't no saints, only sinners
What bitch ain't fucked a winner?
I'm a blue ribbon nigga
Talk down on you two pigeon niggas
Front five or better
Yeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever

// F.I.F.A. //

They been trying to tie me to the BALCO
Too many clicks in the dial tone
I'm my city's Willy Falcon
How you niggas celebrating Alpo?
I'm disgusted
Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall's adjusted
Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It's good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
'Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn't have to make a cameo to get it off

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA

Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I'm at your door
You don't wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow 'em
I done laid in lawns when they didn't mow 'em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show 'em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief
It's on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don't duck and dodge
You can't trust them odds

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it's FIFA

// Sunshine //

[Jill Scott:]
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

[Pusha T:]
America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain't new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I'm filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda's baby next door to the candy lady
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can't hear it over gun play
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain't enough proof
So we still lose

[Jill Scott:]
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

[Pusha T:]
I don't got no march in me, I can't turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They'll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don't get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don't lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I'm Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it's either you or me
Let the sunshine, 'cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

[Jill Scott:]
It's more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
