// Millions //

[Pusha T:]
You know what happens when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together right?
We get that money

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

This that shit that ya'll wanted?
This shit cook up hard don't it?
Ya'll gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it? (yeah)
I'm tired nigga and ya'll gotta pay your tithes nigga
Call my Phantom the Holy Ghost
Church on chrome wheel tires nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid
'Cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came
For that knot saved in that shoe box
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in Blu-ray and these black diamonds like Boondocks

I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin'
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
And them whores with angel faces cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians have em shitting on all their bitches, ah!

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

[Rick Ross:]
I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my acappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

[Pusha T:]
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door
Roll through the hood like task force
Fast forwardâoops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs
And we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang it dry like clothes line

I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin'
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fucking all y'all bitches - aah!

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Millions, millions in the ceiling
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet

This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted, this shit sound like God don't it

// Doesn't Matter //

[French Montana:]
This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas, that always got something to say
Got some nerve to have an opinion

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, oh

[Pusha T:]
There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Do it my way, I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Let's' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Let's talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
RG3 nigga, be that
Runnin' through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate 'cause you niggas do not live it, no

[French Montana:]
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, oh

[Pusha T:]
Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', rifle-pop worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray

[French Montana:]
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, oh

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, oh

My name is my name!

// Blocka //

[Popcaan:]
Dis type ah shit happen everyday
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

[Travis Scott:]
I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

[Pusha T:]
All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won't lie
Multi cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Rent-a-cars for the whole month, drop Porsche money, no co-sign
Yuugh, my records ain't got to sell, nigga
Woo, go diamond off of my cell, nigga
Give a fuck what you sells, that chance come, I take mine
I ball hard, you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you a brick hater
We see a bitch, you fall in love, I fall back 'cause my bitch date her
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

[Travis Scott:]
I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper

[Pusha T:]
Welcome to my blocka, take a look at my world
Diamond on my blocka, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas
All we see is choppas, that spotlight on my blocka
Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' 'round, all them hoes feelin' special
Woo, I know the rent due, fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line, God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream work, all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

[Travis Scott:]
I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

// Road Runner //

[Troy Ave:]
Ay yo, they said it's 10 points higher up there
We got to go get that

Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

[Pusha T:]
One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
It's only four letters, I ain't worried 'bout a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas, fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star; we stylin' in

[Troy Ave:]
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

[Pusha T:]
You niggas ain't takin' road trips for real
Route 13 with the vacuum seal
Pre-paid Legal on my window shield
The ice cream man's on his Jack & Jill
Moving weight state to state; MACK trucks I deal, MACK trucks I fill
I feel better knowin' that the donor is anonymous
See, my diamond is growin'
Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin'
Reasonable Doubt flowin' on your niggas
Been gettin' it since '96 in black AC Vigors
Snub.38 with the matte black trigger
When How Can I Be Down was filled with crack niggas

[Troy Ave:]
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

// Revolution //

From Virginia, never rated
Before us, no one ever made it
Dope boy lane, a nigga paved it
When every nigga was afraid to say it
Sold a mill, spent a mill
We was grindin', Lord's will
Never thought of hiatus
Only chains, hi haters
All these bitches, high maintenance
But I love it though, I cater
Deal fell, Tony saved us
After blowing up, Al Qaeda
Feds rushed like Raiders
Took our coach down, Al Davis
Regroup, tears faded
Casket Drop a year later
Three albums, three majors
Only critics to our favor
Crew members turned traitors
Put the spin on it, tornadoes
Our father, thy neighbor
Couldn't tell me that God hate us
I was lost, I was jaded
Malice found his way to our savior
Now author, he offers
Way to view it 'fore I see coffins
Way to view it 'fore we see vultures
Different way to view it, for the culture
Ross called 'em, Ye and all them
In Hawaii, Jay and all them
I was honored to be called in
Ran away with it, "So Appalled" them
New catalog gonna hurt you
Go on it, it's dark like it's curfew
Goin' in the vault, it will earth you
I'm back in with P, it's full circle

// Only You Can Tell It //

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

[Pusha T:]
Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
EGHCK! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

[Wale:]
Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', 'cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shout-out to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us 'cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

// Trust You //

[Kevin Gates:]
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl

[Pusha T:]
Started out as just a fuck mission
Who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya
Dope boy, they got trust issues
Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later, we in the villa suites
Top back, we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Woo! I'm good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Woo! You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turned up, we turned out
We too far gone to ever turn back

[Kevin Gates:]

[Pusha T:]
Locked phones, past tense
Pass codes, we past this
Pass time, Presidential
Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds, we Bowflexing
Pitch dope, touch down
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you
My bitch stunting, that's me
I break it down, then break her off
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm balling
You still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Woo! But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turned up, we turned out
We too far gone to ever turn back

Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl

Please don't mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes

// Take My Life //

I hope you pussy motherfuckers die
Wish death upon they soul until they burnin' in a fire
I'm the illest motherfucker breathin', fuck yo rhyme or yo reason
Fucking over yo issues, it's kill-a-ho-nigga season
I made my way, way, I found my road, road
Bar-arada-da, I made my own, ho
YUGHHH, you ain't ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I'm a global nigga, Champs-ÃlysÃ©es shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don't know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
And I feel

[Andrea Martin:]
And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

It ain't enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It's no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they're still pointing in
Couple million records sold, still say I'm poisoning
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
We ain't got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I'm still buying mo' guns
Mo' money, mo' murder nigga, choose one

[Andrea Martin:]
And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

// Re-Up Gang Motivation //

Two-door, four-door, sedan, roadster
Cabriolet convertible, careening in the coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps is like a holster
We balling â ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, mimosa, raise a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami
Playing Boca like it's poker
Had a room at the La Quinta
Full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel a ulcer
Hundred grand up in the sofa, reupholstered
I am twisted
Saying Heath Ledger Joker to you jokers
If you Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I am Sosa
I am cultured, I am legend
I am Liva, I am closer
To the best writer alive
Other two, I'm the closest
No holsters, no chauffeurs
No mask, no witness
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no joking
All-Star we play
C-I-two A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch â it's my b-day
This life that we live is for the connoisseurs
Carnival, gives our form
Everyday pool side cabana floss
Mami in Monolos, I'm in that Gucci polo
With the multi color moving dolo on my solo
My niggas that's in prison I'm their eyes and their ears
Every champagne night, for every laugh there's a tear
There's a picture being shown, every jail every tear
Representing so my niggas know I'm here
Polaroids being shown in every jail, every tear
Representing all my niggas know I shared from the heart

// I Am Forgiven //

This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's clichÃ© the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 lists
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide

I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me

I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me

I am forgiven
You don't do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
Let this hold you over
It's just an appetizer
Ha ha!
My Name is My name coming soon
