Album: FearOfGod

// I Still Wanna Rock //

[Pusha T:]
It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest
The thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70s, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and have a nigga try to strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't TiVo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the RICO
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish-scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

[Rick Ross:]
Grew up watching mamma car repoed
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans 'cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope a real nigga sell yayo
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show em all love, the bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor-made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

See my face on the news and it ain't TiVo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the RICO
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish-scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

[Ab-Liva:]
Testarossa top models, G4s, Gucci pass the crease off
Everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder fall, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win
Celebration spills through the morning like an Ambien
Bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilates on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper, blew a fuse and caught a body on
Cocaine storaging, Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in

See my face on the news and it ain't TiVo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the RICO
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish-scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

// Money On My Mind Freestyle //

Money on my mind, money on my mind
You see, the only real money is fast money
And with these niggas walk around with, that's little flash money
Baby don't buy it
I know he's a ball player, but he's not gonna spend it
He's been poor for much too long, so trust me

[Pusha T:]
They thought I lay dead, I was playing possum
Spot me everywhere with the 8 like Kate Goslin
Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing
Now they hide their head like an ostrich
Optimus Prime and that gull wing
Feeling like I transform, niggas still hands on
Whip it like a sandstorm, had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems
Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through
Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas is soft so on that pillow's where you talk
Can't find it in them d-list, actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them
Don't you know that it's money over bitches
Bitches love money, I granting them three wishes, Push

Shout out my nigga Don C, aka Givenchy Don C
Ya ain't even know that you got an aka did you, ah aha
Always in that fly shit, Mike Dean what up? Brendan
Or should I say international Brendan, Marcus Paul? Refresh, yeah
The fear of Gods in these motherfuckers
You can act like don't hear this shit man
Niggas ain't fucking with me man, no games, yeah

// Blow / Funk Flex Freestyle //

[Pusha T:]
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just tryna find my way up out this fucking kitchen
A Birdseye view got me channeling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven

We kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors
Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue
Grant's, Jackson's, no room for George

Yeah, the fear of God's in you motherfuckers
This art imitate my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice
My music's for your soul, inspiration for your life

Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her bachelors
While my old bitch went back to get her Masters
Same graduation, I was clapping in the rafters

The truth hurts every time it's revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill

The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up, sipping Java
Ey yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler?
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change

[Kanye West:]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool."
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news."
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Pusha T:]
Uh, look, uh uh
I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese

The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piÃ±ata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter

Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas night was fucking awesome
But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Loss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune

Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking gorgeous, whoa
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith

Whiter than that coke brush did they paint me with [?]
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But they devil-red, tires double tread
I posting parks up, that gives me double head
Tight rope walking, tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did
Yeah

// Cook It Down //

I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I'm just asking you to listen
I'm living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching
Last words "fuck you all" feel the ropes tension
I'll never compromise, in it 'til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in their honor, their legacy's in bottles
Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha
Yeah, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for downfall

Say you telling on me, told them folks 'bout me
All this coke 'round me like it floats 'round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down every time I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down every time I come around

Got me looking at the crown from a birds-eye view
'Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I'm standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit'll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk
Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me
If you can't feel the joy off a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo's true story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it's Peter Pan

Say you telling on me, told them folks 'bout me
All this coke 'round me like it floats 'round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down every time I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down every time I come around

// Open Your Eyes //

"Oâ"
"Open yourâ"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poorâ"

"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boyâ"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boyâ"

Seeing is believin', believe when you see it
They're saying I'm the bestâshitâI'm just trying to be it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it
Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it
Double-U double-I, spelled so you can see it
'Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we were snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yuh, as you compare me to a fuckin' rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned it tan, sold world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras

"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boyâ"

You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't mind meâI'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah

I never pitched a penny in a wishing well (Never)
I laid it all on a fishing scale (Yes)
And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
The next mission when the tide dries up
With no inner vision yet their eyes wide shut
Fifteen years abducting spies like us
Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just steer through 'em

"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boyâ"

The odds is against us
No excuses though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
They done freed Weezy
Congratulations, my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh

// Can I Live Freestyle //

Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Liva Don
Noah on the boards
Steven Victor on the camera
Virgil what up

They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
'Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big dogging like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the IMAX experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me 'round the atlas
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter

Can I live
You tell me, can I live

// Touch It //

[Kanye West:]
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

[Pusha T:]
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut CÃ®roc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
'Cause I return the favor like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, 'cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream

[Kanye West:]
I need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Could you please touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under mistletoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last

I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don't have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin

I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

// Speakers Going Hammer Freestyle //

[Soulja Boy:]
I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer
(The dough boy version though, yeah)

[Pusha:]
Back up in this bitch niggas free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all I need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
You trace hard, while I cake hard
You niggas Lil B's to the Based God
I been cooking, is you mistooken?
Chi town plug got the city jukin'
Givenchy motorcycle leathers
Mad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mixed ones whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em
She oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em
Can't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em
Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em

[Soulja Boy:]
I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer
(The dough boy version though, yeah)

So Liv
I picks her up, right?
She tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier
This guy had a Range Rover just like you
I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin' Range Rover
This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money
You must be out your fucking mind
See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga
Get it right
