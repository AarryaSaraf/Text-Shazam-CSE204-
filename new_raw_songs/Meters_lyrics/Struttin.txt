Album: Struttin

// Chicken Strut //

Just keep on strut...

Fell on you

Just keep on strut...

// Wichita Lineman //

I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overlord
I hear you singin' in the wire
And I hear you in the wild
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line

I know I'll need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows, that stretch down south
Will never stand this rain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line
Still on the line
Still on the line

// Same Old Thing //

The same old thing
The same old thing

Same old thing, uh
The same old thing, ah
Same old thing
But it still is good, y'all
Same old thing
It gonna do any way, yeah
Same old thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Same old thing
Come on now, people
Same old thing
We've got to get with it now
Same old thing
Say do what you wanna
Same old thing
I know you can do it
Same old thing
I get the same old thing
Same old thing
But come on now
Same old thing
