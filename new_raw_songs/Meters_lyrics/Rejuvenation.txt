// People Say //

Powers of today
So pretty darn confused
Giving everybody
In the world the blues

Food is getting high
And the fuel is getting low
The rich are getting richer
And the poor are getting poor

People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?
People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?

People say, people say
(What the people say?)
(What the people?)
Have your share and my share
And your share is my share too

Your eyes are blind folded
And your mind controlled
What the powers do to you
Destruction is in the air, oh yeah

And when is it going to quit
Somebody end the madness
Gettin' sick and tired of it

People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?
People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?

People say, people say
(What the people say?)
(What the people?)
(What the people say?)
(What the people say?)

(What the people say?)
(What the people say?)
(What the people say?)
You gotta listen to 'em
(What the people say?)

Robbing and they're stealing
And they're breaking in your home
It's getting a little dangerous
To walk the street alone

Somebody better get on the case
Real thing
(Real thing)
And you got no time to waste

People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?
People say, people say
Have I got a right to live?

People say, people say
(What the people say?)
(What the people?)

// Love Is For Me //

Skin so soft
Smile so new
It's all these things
I see in you

Hearts' so warm
And you're mind's so clear
It's things like these
I see in you, my dear

I believe everything about you, baby
(I believe...)

So many things in you
To appreciate
Like an impatient child
I can hardly wait

My silent love (love) is goin' round?
Because of you girl
I'm so proud (baby)
It don't matter how foolish I might sound

It would be even more senseless not havin' you around

I believe everything about you, baby
(I believe...)

Love is for me
You oughta be
Right here in my loving arms

Please don't you wait
Don't hesitate

Turnin' on your love?
Turnin' on it mama
Give me your lovin', baby

I don't mean
To impose on you
Such a prize to my eyes
What else could I do

Help me climb the mountain
Of success
The cliff that leads
To your happiness

I believe everything about you, baby
(I believe...)

Love is for me
You oughta be
Right here in my lovin' arms

Please don't you wait
Don't hesitate
Turnin' on your love

Lemme break it down

Let me love you, baby
That's the part I wanna do

Give me your sweet, sweet sweet love

Got to give it to me
I really do love you
Said I know you're mine

Sweet sweet sweet lovin'

// Just Kissed My Baby //

I feel like a king
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Money don't mean a thing
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Way down inside
A man is a man
And a woman is a woman

Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Get along

I feel so good inside
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Half your share is my share
And my share is your share, too
Squeeze my lemon
'Til the juice runs down my leg
Feel like a king
'Cause I just kissed my baby

Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Get along

Night people
Hanging out
Looking at each other
Waiting for something to happen

// What'cha Say //

Keeping my mind to the sky
Watching the clouds pass me by, by
Soaring ever so high
And I can't come down

This way to go where to turn
Passing more time just to burn, burn
Keeping if I should turn
Straight to your heart

Follow my steps I'm delayed
Selfishness always betray
Sometimes there must be a change
And I changed

If I think of a way to express my love
Would you think of a way to receive
If I gave you myself for the rest of my days
Would you promise never to leave

Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love

Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
...

// Jungle Man //

(Here comes the jungle man
Good Lord)

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
I'm the jungle man
That's what I am

In the jungle I'm the king
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man

Got my home, don't need to roam
The jungle is where I live
Peace and love and harmony
Is what I have to give

I'm friends with the monkey
I'm friends with the bird
I'm close with the lion
They all got the word

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am

In the jungle I'm the king
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man

Get it!
Uh, black and white, full of stripes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Black and white, full of stripes

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
Oh, I'm the jungle man
That's what I am

// Hey Pocky A-Way //

Little bitty boy, with a heart of steel
You can't boogie now but your sister sure will
Feel good music, I've been told
Good for your body and it's good for your soul
Gonna do it now

// It Ain't No Use //

Ain't no use to cut you loose
I wouldn't last a day
Ain't no use to cut you loose
I guess I'm here to stay

I could think of a thousand reasons
For me to leave you
But I know if I ever walked out that door
I wouldn't know what to do

Ain't no use to cut you loose
I wouldn't last a day
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
Ain't no use, oh, to cut you loose
I guess I'm here to stay
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)

You got me where you want me (Want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free now

You got me where you want me (Where you want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free now

You got me where you want me (Where you want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free

(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
Oh, I'm goin' out of my mind
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
What I wanna do
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)

Just ain't no use, I know I can't cut you loose
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
I wanna go, I wanna stay, I wanna go, I wanna stay
Don't know what I wanna do now
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
