// Doris //

(Doris)

Don't close your heavy
Don't close your heavy eyes
Doris (Doris)

You have so much
So much to leave behind
If you travel to the other side
Doris (Doris)

I'll be right here holding your hand
You taught me how to be a real man
I'll be right here holding your hand
You taught me how to be a real man

Yes, you did
Yes, you did
Yes, you did

Maybe I'm selfish
Don't know the pain deep inside
Doris (Doris)

You put up a good
Put up a damn good fight
If you travel to the other side
Doris (Doris)

I'll be right here holding your hand
You taught me how to be a real man
I'll be right here holding your hand
You taught me how to be a real man

Yes, you did
Yes, you did
(Doris)
Yes, you did
Yes, you did

Don't you leave
Don't you go, Doris
New Orleans clean, the legacy
(Doris)
Don't you leave
Don't you go, Doris
New Orleans Queen, the legacy so strong

Don't you leave
Don't you go, Doris
New Orleans Queen, the legacy
(Doris)
Don't you leave
Don't you go, Doris
New Orleans Queen, the legacy so strong

// B-Side //

Deeply miss your love
When I'm far away
In another place
All that I dream of
My chest is your pillow

Waiting for your love
You in all the ways
In another place
All I'm thinking of
Just can't get enough

You
May not be
Everywhere I go

Get back

But you stay
On my mind
Wherever I go

Like that

When I fly above
Weeks roll into days
Though I'm far away
Your fantasy I love
Just can't get enough

You
May not be
Everywhere I go

Jump back

But you stay
On my mind
Wherever I go

Like that

Deeply miss your love
When I'm far away
In another place
All that I dream of
My chest is your pillow

Waiting for your love
You in all the ways
In another place
All I'm thinking of
Just can't get enough

(You) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(May not be) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Everywhere I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(But you stay) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(On my mind) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Wherever I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(You) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(May not be) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Everywhere I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(But you stay) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(On my mind) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Wherever I go) Slide? (Slide like that)

// Chocolate Hills //

I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
Just stay forever
It feels like heaven
When I'm kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

Baby let's go
Slide out
To a place no one knows
Are we dreaming, are we not?
Who cares?
Let's get lost in the flow

I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
This day forever
This day forever
It feels like heaven
Woah
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

Baby put down
Your pride
No need to have fear
I will take care of you
Lay down
Just be with me here

I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
It's now or never
It feels like heaven
Woah
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

The way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
Please stay forever
It feels like heaven
When I'm kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

// Father Father //

Forgive me, Father
For all your grace

Father, Father
Look at these works that I've done
I present them to you
In hopes to get your attention

Father, Father
Look at the mess that I made
Just a man with unclean hands
From you I hide my face

Father, Father
The guilt's cutting through like blades
Just a man with unclean hands
From you I hide my face

My Son
My Love is always here for you
You don't' have to
Climb a ladder
Bend over backwards
To gain my love for you
Cause
If you forgot
I am love
From the bottom to the top
My love steadfast and never stops
Continue on
And it never slows down

I know I know
The weight of your sin
Is heavier than a thousand tons
But my son Jesus
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the future and present one
Oh yeah

Oooo

Father, Father
Look at these works that I've done
I present them to you
In hopes to gain your attention

Father, Father
Look at the mess that I made
Just a man with unclean hands
From you, I hide my face

Father, Father
This guilt's cutting through like blades
Just a man with unclean hands
From you I hide my face

My Son
My love is always here for you
You don't have to
Climb a ladder
Bend over backwards
To gain my love for you

Cause
If you forgot
I am love from the bottom to the top
My love steadfast and never stops
Continue on
And it never slows down

I know I know
The weight of your sin
Is heavier than a thousand tons
But my son Jesus
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the future and present one

Oooooo

// Mariella //

Hair pitch black like the midnight sky
Eyes like the jungle, you're something wild
Her sweet melody sings wherever I go
Running through my mind sitting in this road

Maybe I'll write a letter from this little old
Country town down in Texas
I'll keep it here for you
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mari, can we go together

Nothing here changes, seasons go by
You said hello, you said goodbye
Did you run away, Mariella, where did you go?
Somewhere new, somewhere old

Maybe I don't ever wanna live alone
In a country town down in Texas
Ah, with the memory of you
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, holding onto you
