Album: Lovesexy

// I No //

Rain is wet, and sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, and stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows
When love calls, U gotta go

(I Know) [repeated in the background]

([Listen, the soul of this song belongs to God])

Welcome 2 the New Power Generation
The reason my voice is so clear
Is there's no smack in my brain
Hundalasiliah

Ha na na-sha na na na na na na

I know there is a heaven, I know there is a hell
Listen 2 me people, I got a story to tell
I know there was confusion lightnin' all around me
That's when I called his name don't U know he found me

No! Is what Spooky Electric say, it's not OK
But I know love is the only way till my dying day
No - til my dying day I'll be OK
Cuz Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

I know there is a devil because he talks so loud
He makes U do things that your friends do, hang out with the crowd
But my Lord he is so quiet when He calls your name
When U hear it your heart will thunder
U will want 2 hear it every day

No! (people) Is what Spooky Electric say (everbody say)
But don't U know that I know
Love is the only way, til my dying day
No - Til my dying day I'll be OK
Cuz Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

Alright y'all, everybody in the house (serve it up, Frankie)
Here's what I want U 2 do
Raise your hand up, straight in the air
Swing it 2 the right, savoir faire
Up on the 2, swing on the 4
Everybody on the dancefloor

Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho

Y'all ain't got it together
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Raise your hand up, straight in the air

(let's get it up, let's get it up)

Yeah

Say no
(say no) No - if U can't find your way - everybody say
(say no) No - if U're afraid, everybody ain't got it made
(Say no) - if U want a drug other than the God above
No - if U need a drink every single day...
Blow that devil away!

Say yes
Yes - if U want this feeling called love
(come on 'ya, say)
Yes - if U want it now raise your hand 2 the man above
(Yes) Up on the 2, swing right on the 4
We want everybody 2 open this door!

Say no - if U don't wanna live life under the gun
(I know) We know a better way 2 have some fun
(I know) I know - there is a heaven and a hell
I know there is a heaven and a hell

[song breaks down into a crowd noise...]

Tell ya what...
Man, are we on the guest list?

A peanut-butter sandwich (her and her girlfriend)
(the one that was standin')
[D] (right next to my woman...)
(right next to my woman)
Let us praise God [E]
With the fruit of the vine ((My name's Andre Crabtree III))
Our [innocent] symbol of glory ((I've got more holes than a golf course))
And thank him 4 lessons
Of the past, for life, prince... (I said who popped the question?)

// Alphabet St. //

She'll want me from my head 2 my feet

Talk 2 me lover
Come on tell me what U taste
Didn't your mama tell U
Life is 2 good 2 waste? (Put your love down)
Didn't she tell U
That Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If U can hang, U can trip on it
U surely won't fall (Put your love down)
No side effects and
The feeling last 4-ever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes U feel clever (Put your love down)
U kiss your enemies
Like U know U should
Then U jerk your body
Like a horny pony would (Put your love down)
U jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!

And while U're at it tell your papa about this

Yeah-yeah

Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scam water ripple

Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam

// Anna Stesia //

Have U ever been so lonely
That U felt like U were the
Only one in this world?

Have U ever wanted 2 play
With someone so much U'd take
Any one boy or girl?

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way...
So I danced

Music late, nothing great (Music late, nothing great)
No way 2 differentiate (No way 2 differentiate)
I took a chance

Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips 2 say

"We could live 4 a little while
If U could just learn 2 smile
U and I could fly away, fly away."

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me
Praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps U could show me, baby (show me, baby)

Anna Stesia come 2 me
Talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
If I was just closer 2 somethin' (closer)
Closer 2 your higher self
I don't know
Closer 2 heaven (Maybe) closer 2 God (closer to God)

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget that U are the rule
U are my God, I am Your child
From now on, 4 U I shall be wild
I shall be quick I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story, no matter how long (no matter how... no matter)

We're just a play in Your master plan
Now, my Lord I understand

(I understand)

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
[repeated over chorus]

// Dance On //

Oh, pick it up!
There's a bass guitar in this

Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky
Tell me how many young brothers must die

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

Little Talk Johnny blew the big score
The gang nailed his feet 2 a wooden floor
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They all know the words but the music is doomed

Everybody
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Pick it up
Dance on, dance on

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

A bass guitar in spider webs, longing 4 the funk
Uzi gun takes his place in a wagon trunk
(get off me, punk, U ain't sexy)
Stealin' ladies purses then settin' them a'flame
M&M killers playin' Mickey Mouse games

Lord have mercy
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)
Dance on, dance on (Dance on)

It's time 4 new education
The former rules don't apply
We need a power structure that breeds production
Instead of jacks who vandalize
Detroit - what's happenin'?

What color is your money today? [this is sung in a round]
Get your money straight
Everybody dance on

// Lovesexy //

New Power, New Power, give it 2 me
Oh, it need some bottom in here... lay it on me

(hey now, hey now)

Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
It put my name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Dig me now

Anyone that's ever touched it,
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
And I got 2 tell the world,
I just can't keep it to myself
All in life becomes easier,
No question is unresolved
And I'm not afraid

Come on and touch it, I know U will love it
With it I know that heaven's a butterfly kiss away

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Lovesexy

Lovesexy

Rain is wet, sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows (Lovesexy)
When love calls, U got 2 go

Lovesexy

Tonight we make love with only words
Girls first, girls first
OK so like first I'll start by telling U how
Intelligent a curve your behind has
And then I can tell U that I can just smell U
And race cars burn rubber in my pants
But I really dig trippin' on the thought of
Being caught by someone with your beauty, style and grace
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
4 just 2 nights with your face
I don't want to make love 2 U
I just want 2 look at U
I just want 2 listen 2 U

Oh, pretty little whip, U got me drippin'
Drippin' all over the floor, the floor
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours

Living rooms
I think... I think U would
I think U wanna play house
Yeah, I think U wanna play house

Lovesexy

U don't mind
I think U... uh...
I think U want me to (beep) inside of U
Yea...yeah... I...

U want (Lovesexy) me to s...suck around your living room
Ha Ha
Yeah, U...U want me to walk right down your halls

Mmm hmmm
Lovesexy

U want me to swivel in your love seat
Don't U baby?

U want me to write my name on your walls
U want me to write my name

Lovesexy
We make love with only words
I'll make love to U, tomorrow

Sweet dreams

// I Wish U Heaven //

Doubts of our conviction
Follow where we go
And when the world's compassion
Ceases still I know
4 your every touch I
Thank U so much
4 your every kiss I...

I wish U love
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

If I see 11
U can say it's 7
Still I wish U heaven

I wish U love
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven
I wish U heaven

Can a boy who drops out at school
At 13 years of age
Answer the 2 of life and death
When it slaps him in the face?
Who's 2 blame when he's got no place 2 go
And all he's got is the sense 2 know
That a life of crime'll help him beat U in the race
Help him beat U in the race (Help him beat U in the race)

Wave your hands 4 positivity y'all!
All the boys and all the girls (All the boys and all the girls)
U R the new kings of the world!
Shall the court sing together

"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
A whirlwind designed 2 slow U down
It cuts like a knife and tries 2 get in U
This Spooky Electric sound
Give up if U want 2 and all is lost
Spooky Electric will be your boss"

Call People magazine, Rolling Stone
Call your next of kin, cuz your ass is gone
He's got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side
Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, U better say died
Or U can fly high right by Spooky and all that he crawls 4
Spooky and all that he crawls 4

Don't kiss the beast
We need love & honesty, peace & harmony
Positivity
Love & honesty, peace & harmony
I said, hold on 2 your soul, U got a long way 2 go

Sho' nuff, sho' nuff, sho' nuff

Don't kiss the beast
Be superior at least

Hold on 2 your soul, y'all, court, sing
Hold on 2 your soul, we got a long way 2 go
Hold on 2 your soul
