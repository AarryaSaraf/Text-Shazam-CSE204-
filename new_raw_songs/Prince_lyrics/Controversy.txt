// Controversy //

I just can't believe
All the things people say, controversy
Am I black or white?
Am I straight or gay? Controversy

Do I believe in God?
Do I believe in me?
Controversy, controversy
Controversy

I can't understand
Human curiosity, controversy
Was it good for you?
Was I what you wanted me to be?
Controversy

Do you get high?
Does your daddy cry?
Controversy, controversy
Controversy

Do I believe in God?
Do I believe in me?
Some people wanna die
So they can be free

I said life is just a game
We're all just the same
Do you wanna play?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven

Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us

Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever

// Sexuality //

Stand up everybody, this is your life
Let me take u to another world, let me take u tonight
U don't need no money, u don't need no clothes
The Second Coming, anything goes
Sexuality is all u'll ever need
Sexuality - let your body be free

C'mon everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we gotta organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm OK as long as u are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need

Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Everybody...
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
One time say...
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Reproduction of a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize

We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists - 89 flowers on their back...inventors of the Accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera... What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are u listening?
We need a new breed - Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed
No child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing

Stand Up, Organize
We need a new breed...Leaders, Stand Up, Organize
I wanna be in the new breed, Stand up, Organize
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality

// Do Me, Baby //

Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around

Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on and do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Here we are looking for a reason
You to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby please stop teasing me

What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

Do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Come on and do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Do, do, do, do me baby
(Do me baby)
Do me baby all night long
(Give it to me)
Do me baby
I want you now
Do me baby
Give it to me
(Do me baby)
Do me baby, don't want to do it all alone
I want your love
Do me baby
Give it to me
(Do me baby)
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want you now)

You're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you going to do
You just going to sit there and watch?
Alright
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not going to stop until the war is over
Help me!
There okay, okay
I'm so cold, just hold me

// Private Joy //

My little secret, my private joy

// Annie Christian //

Annie Christian wanted to be number 1
But her kingdom never comes, thy will be done
She couldn't stand the glory, she would be 2nd to none
The way Annie tells the story, she's his only son
Annie Christian wanted to be a big star
So she moved to Atlanta and she bought a blue car
She killed black children, and what's fair is fair
If u try and say u're crazy, everybody say electric chair
Electric chair

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs

Annie Christian was a whore always looking for some fun
Being good was such a bore, so she bought a gun
She killed John Lennon, shot him down cold
She tried to kill Reagan, everybody say gun control
Gun control

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs

Liar Liar Liar! got ya in a jam
Put your head on the block, somebody say ABSCAM
ABSCAM

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs

// Jack U Off //

If u're looking for somewhere to go
Thought I'd take u to a movie show
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack u off
I can't give u everything u want
But I can take u to a restaurant
If u're not hungry
I'll jack u off

If your man ain't no good
Come on over to my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack u off

If u're tired of the masturbater
Little girl, we can go on a date
And if u like, I'll jack u off

I'll jack u off, jack u off
I'll jack u off, jack u off

I only do it for a worthy cause
Viriginity or menopause
U'll have an instant heart attack if I jack u off

If u really really want to be a star
We gotta do it in your momma's car
Naked in a cadillac, I'll jack u off

If we can't find no place to go
Girl, I'll take u to a movie show, we can sit in the back
And I'll jack u off

I'll jack u off, jack u off
