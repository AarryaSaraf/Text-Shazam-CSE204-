// When 2 R In Love //

So fair she looked tonight,
The brightest star appeals to your sex.
Before we do anything,
Let me just talk 2 U.

When 2 R in love
They whisper secrets
Only they 2 can hear
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love (love)
Their stomachs will pound
Every time the other comes near
When 2 R in love

When 2 R in love
Falling leaves will appear 2 them
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)

When 2 R in love
The speed of their hips
Can be faster than a runaway train

Drop, drop, drop, drop, water, water, water

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?

When 2 R in love
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
Of penetration (let alone the act)
Let alone the actual act

When 2 R in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack

Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When the 2 R in love
(Love) in love - can U hear me?

(hold me)
(yeah)
(just like that)
(don't move)

Super-fine heifer (super fine)
I saw u in the Vogue
I knew you would be trouble, (trouble, trouble)
but why go (go,go)
I'll give you 7 sips of
Elderberry wine (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
Maybe we'll unlock the
Secrets of your mind

Don't all girls look the same? They don't?
Oh, what a shame.

I'm sure you're quite intelligent (U think she does, but think again. See?)
A whiz at math and all that shit (how 'bout that?)
But I'm, I'm a tad more interested (Ah ha ha look it,)
(She can't even walk in those shoes)

Don't u want 2 play with me? (Yes)
What's the matter with me, Cindy? (Nothing)

Oh Cindy C, won't u play with me?

Music is the key 2 set yourself free
From depression, drugs and increasing poverty
The key is 2 the lock, the lock is on the door
The door has a knob that u've never turned before
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock
Cuz there's the key 2 unlock the body
Place it like that 2 open up the door
The door 2 the house full of people galore
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot
And believe it or not, all the troubles u forgot
It's just that easy if u want it 2 be
For all the fellas, and the young ladies
So ease your mind and set yourself free
2 the mystifying music that we call Cindy C

Oh Cindy C, won't u play with me?
Oh Cindy C

// Dead On It //

Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway
I turned on my radio 2 hear some music play
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead
And the only good rapper is one that's dead on it

Uh, Dead on it

Shall we go back? (Yeah!)
Let's go

Negros from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should
A magnum fro is better when u got a poof on it
And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it

(Funky dead on it)
uh, dead (on it) on it

Shall we go back? Let's go

They dead on it, wow

See the rapper's problem usually stem from being tone deaf
Pack the house then try 2 sing,
there won't be no one left (ha ha) (on it)
Parking lot's on fire, brothers peelin' out of the town
They say in disgust, they singin' their guts
Rappin' done let us down (down down)
u got 2 be dead... on it

Dead on it

(dead)

All the sisters like it when u lick 'em on the knees
Don't believe me? (no)
Try it once then stop, they'll be begging
Please, please, please (please, please, please)
Shoo be doo wa, dead on it
What does that have 2 do with the funk?
Nothing, but who's paying the bills?
If u don't wanna lick my knees, I'm sho' your mama will

Uh, cuz we, cuz we, cuz we dead on it

De, de- de- de- de- de- de, dead on it, on it

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

My bed's a coffin, Dracula ain't got shit on me
My nickname's Hell's-a-Poppin', I'm badder than the Wicked Witch
I got a gold tooth, costs more than your house
I got a diamond ring on four fingers, each one the size of a mouse

They dead, they dead on it, on it

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Wait now, hang up, dial tone on the 3
U know, U know, I'm busy, 2 scizzy
Can't nobody fuck with me

Cuz I'm dead (on it, on it, on it)
on it

Shoo be doo wa wa, dead on it

Dead on it, on it, on it

Dang, dang, dang, dang, (dead on it) shoo be dang, dang, dang, dead on it
Dead, dead on it

// Rock Hard In A Funky Place //

Does anybody know you're here?
This house of ill-repute (Ooohh honey I'm scared of u)
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
I guess this is what u get 4 being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder you're all alone
It's written all over your face
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place

Here comes a lady so u cover up
She's a freaked out,
Funky electric mama with double cups
Say u, u could cop if u wanted 2
Because something near your leg
Is haunting u, such a disgrace
U're rock hard in a funky place, ow!

Rock hard in a funky place

U was workin' on the line
U could drop on her
But u couldn't concentrate
When your dick saw her
Maybe if u cop a nut in the car (Maybe if u cop a nut in the car)
Maybe u could think
About playing guitar

(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Oh yeah

Rock hard in a funky place

All you're looking 4 is love
Or a reason 2 believe there's a God above
Pretty soon you'll get enough
And head back 2 a life so tough
I just hate 2 see an erection go 2 waste
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place
Say it
Rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Oohh U rock hard in a funky place
U rock hard in a funky place
Say it, y'all

(rock, rock)
what? (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We gotta go, y'all
tune in next week (rock, rock)
Same time (rock, rock)
same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
oohhh yeah (rock, rock, rock, rock)
we will rock, y'all (rock, rock)

But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger

(What kind of fuck ending was that?)
