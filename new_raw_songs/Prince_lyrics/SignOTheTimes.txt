// Sign O' The Times //

Oh yeah
In France a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Time, time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Times, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why

Time, time

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn

Time, times

It's silly, no?
When a rocket blows
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh why, oh why, Sign O the Times

Times, times

Sign O the Times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's to late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate... if it's a boy

Times, times

Times, times

// Play In The Sunshine //

Oooh Doggies!
We wanna play in the sunshine
We wanna be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Exstacy
We wanna kick like we used 2
Sign up on the dotted line
We gonna dance every dance
Like it's gonna be the last time

We got 2 play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up 2 10
I want 2 meet U (meet U), kiss U (kiss U),
love U (love U), and miss U (miss U)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

Play in the sunshine

We gonna love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him
We're gonna roll him
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)

Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin 2 talk
And the color green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day
and let's play

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

play, play, play, play, play, play, play
We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

(play), (play),
(play) no, (play) no, (play) no
(come on, play) no!, (play) no!, (playplayplay) Yes!

Drummer, do your thang
Drummer, drummer, do your thang
Drummer, drummer, drummer

Let's get out of here (yeah)
(lalalalalalala play, laugh in the sunshine)
we're not afraid 2 (play, laugh in the sunshine)
we are going 2
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
(play, laugh in the sunshine)

// The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker //

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry"
Dorothy laughed
She said "Sounds like a real man 2 me"
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)
I said "Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on" (she say)
"Cuz I'm kind of going with someone"
She said "Sounds like a real man 2 me"
"Mind if I turn on the radio?"
"Oh, my favorite song" she said
And it was Joni singing "Help me I think I'm falling"
(Ring)
The phone rang and she said
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U"
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back
2 the violent room (tell us what U did)
Let me tell U what I did...

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker

Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well

// Starfish And Coffee //

It was 7:45 we were all in line
2 greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
If U asked her what she had 4 breakfast
This is what she'd say
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, U know what we found?

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, honey
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Starfish and coffee

Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's 4 a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singin'

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so)
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so)

// Slow Love //

Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that U're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
4 he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make IT slow
Just like the wind blows

Let's make IT last forever
For a hundred times won't be enough
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feelin'
You've got me reelin'

U can see through race car drivers
Let me show U what I'm made of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

[repeated to fade]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

// Hot Thing //

Hot thing!
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking 4 big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Do U wanna play with me?

Hot thing, baby U dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew U would
Hot thing, tell me what U see
Hot thing, When U smile, when U smile, when U smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles 4 me?

Hot thing, maybe U should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going 2 the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late,
if you're coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them U found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait 2 get U home
Hot thing, where we could be alone
Hot thing, I could read U poetry,
and then we could make a story of our own

Hot thing

// Forever In My Life //

La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want 2 settle down
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U (baby, if U do 2)
And baby if U do 2
Forever, forever, baby I want U forever
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U can make right)
All that is wrong in my world (U are my saviour)
U can make right (U are my light)
U are my saviour, U are my light (Forever I want U in my life)
Forever I want U in my life

(La da da da da da da da)

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own (I'm at that road)
I'm here 2 tell U that I'm at that road (I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it (U than walk it alone)
with U than walk it alone (U are my future)
U are my hero, U are my future (no past)

// If I Was Your Girlfiend //

"Look at the bargains over here, ladies..."
If I was your girlfriend
Would U remember 2 tell me all the things U forgot
When I was your man?
Hey, when I was your man
If I was your best friend
Would U let me take care of U and do all the things
That only a best friend can
Only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would U let me dress U
I mean, help U pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would U run 2 me if somebody hurt U
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

Would U let me wash your hair
Could I make U breakfast sometime
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go 2 a movie and cry together
Cuz 2 me baby that would be so fine

If I was your girlfriend
Baby can I dress U
I mean, help U pick out your clothes
Before we go out
(If I was your girlfriend)
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about (sugar)

Sugar do U know what I'm saying 2 U this evening? (sugar)
Maybe U think I'm being
a little self-centered (if I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want 2 be (sugar)
all of the things U are 2 me (sugar)
Surely, surely U can see (if I was your girlfriend)
{{title repeated in background}}
Is it really necessary 4 me 2 go out of the room
just because U wanna undress?
I mean, we don't have 2 make children 2 make love
And then, we don't have 2 make love 2 have an orgasm
Your body's what I'm all about
Can I see U?
I'll show U
Why not?
U can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it 4 U
Of course I'll undress in front of U!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make U see that it's cool?
Can't U just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend U could
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, 4 U naked I would dance a ballet
Would that get U off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would U tell me?
Would U let me see U naked then?
Would U let me give U a bath?
Would U let me tickle U so hard U'd laugh and laugh
And would U, would U let me kiss U there
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold U tight and hold U long
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try 2 imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try...

// Strange Relationship //

I guess U know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem 2 get a kick out of doing U cold
Oh, what the hell, U always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on 2?
Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self respect U ever had
I took U 4 a ride and baby I'm sorry
The more U love me sugar, the more it makes me mad

Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then U could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way U where, so I had 2 make U mine

Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

// I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man //

It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked if she wanted 2 dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted 2 know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified 4 a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man

It hurt me so bad when she told me
with tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
She couldn't stop cryin'
Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
U know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied

And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
U wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man

// The Cross //

Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, he is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross
Ghettos 2 the left of us
Flowers 2 the right
There'll be bread 4 all of us
If we can just bear the cross

Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings

We all have our problems
Some BIG, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross

Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry 4 he is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross

Ghettos 2 the left of us

If we can just, just bear the cross, yeah

Some are BIG, some are small

[Every man I'll injure]
With my chicken grease

(one more)

(are you ready Paris - Soul Clap)
(ah yeah, ah yeah)

(gimme the bass, gimme the bass, one time)

Said the table 2 the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chillblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair (can't nobody)

Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able! (fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!" (can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?" (say, can't nobody)

So they both went showly down (fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound (can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
"See the table and the chair
Have come 2 take the air!" (y'all - say it y'all)

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother! (can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little browny- (say it, y'all)
mousey and the beetle dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds. (can't nobody fuck with us)
Good God [repeated in the background]

// Adore //

Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

From the first moment I saw U
Ooh, I knew U where the 1
That night I had 2 call U
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' U just how fine U look
In a word, U were sex
All of my cool attitude U took
My body was next
U made love 2 me
Like U where afraid
Was U afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
That's why

Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know U are my fix
I know, that U know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just 4 kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby
U could say that I'm a terminal case
U could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got 2 have your face
All up in the place

I'd like 2 think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
2 your lovely face
Do U know what I'm sayin' 2 ya this evening
I'm just tryin' 2 say
I'm just tryin' 2 say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
I'll be there 4 U
On my heart, on my mind, (truly adore U)
I truly adore U (darlin')
U don't know what you're mean 2 me
Baby, (until the end of time)
Baby, (I'll be there 4 U)
Baby, (U own my heart and mind)
'Til the end of time I'll be there 4 U
(I truly adore U)
Adore U (adore U)

Can I talk 2 U? {{chorus repeated in background}}
Tell U what U mean 2 me
Every time U wander
I'll be your eyes so U can see
I wanna show U things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be (like no) like no other
If U need me, I'll never leave
I know, that U know, without U there is no me
There is no me
Without U there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is 2 weak 2 define how much I adore
U, child
U, child
The last words U hear
The last words U hear

(until the end of time)
I'll be there for you, baby
(until the end of time)

Be with me darlin' til the end of time (until the end of time)
I'll give U my heart
I'll give U my mind
I'll give U my body (until the end of time)
I'll give U my time (until the end of time)
(until the end of time)

4 all time I am with U
U are with me
(until the end of time)
U are with me, U are with me
