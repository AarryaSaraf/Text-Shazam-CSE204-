You see me in that mode, don't disturb me when I'm workin' (Yeah)
Lil' bitch you better back up, don't know what be in these purses (Blaow)
And I ain't say, "Excuse me", 'cause I did that shit on purpose
Yeah, you see a star up in this bitch
You know I brought a hundred black cars in this bitch
Knees freak, I don't like nobody touchin' on my shit
So you know I had to bring my own bottles in this bitch (Ayy, ayy, ah)
Ridin' by myself, shoppin' bag in the backseat
Niggas with the money to they ear don't attract me
Fly out the country, let a prince nigga bag me
Nympho, wanna do a nigga pockets nasty (Ah)
Bitches hatin' on me, but it's cool, niggas love me
Body bangin', I ain't had to let the doctor cut me
Sick of bein' humble, 'cause you bitches don't respect that
And the next one of y'all hoes wanna get bold, I'm gon' check that
And the next one of y'all blogs wanna spread lies, I'm gon' sue you (Yeah)
And the next bitch that break my NDA, they goin' for you too
Now listen to me, I'm givin' you bitches a warning
You gon' have to pay me forever tryna be corny
Ayy, I'm from the city of the drink sippers, slidin', ridin' paint drippers (Yeah)
Bitches so bad, got the famous niggas stage dippers (Baow)
Poppin' all the music, so you know I'm kinda screwed up (Know I'm screwed up)
Wrist so icy, turn a drank into a cool cup (Yeah)
Goin' through so some shit, so I gotta stay busy
Bought a 'Rari, I can't let the shit I'm thinkin' catch up with me (Yeah, catch up with me)

'Cause you know in his head he wanna spread me like a condiment (Ah)
He want me to make that glizzy disappear and swallow it
You know I keep it realer than real, ain't shit 'bout me fraudulent
They take all the hate that they got for me and they market it
When they shit ain't poppin', they usin' Megan for marketing (Yeah)
And they ain't got enough in they budget for me to talk to them (No)
I know you hoes wish that I would get down and stay down (I won't)
Bitch, make a move or keep that shit up on the playground
'Cause I ain't finna stop until I make it to the tin-nop
And I do everything that all my haters said I could not (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it look like a sign just be slidin' on my wrist watch (Ah)
I hope that you ain't shoppin' when I'm shoppin', you get kicked out
I gotta watch my back, 'cause I forget that I'm the shit now
I walk up in the studio pissed off and lay that shit down
Matter fact, wait, stop, bitch, I really rap
I be quick to check you pussy bitches like a pap
Kill a bitch, all I need is a pistol and a pad
Let me get the beat, so they remember who I am

Damn, where the real bitches at?

// Her //

I don't care if these bitches don't like me
'Cause, like, I'm pretty as fuck

Just the other day, I heard a ho say
Matter of fact, what could a ho say?
With a face like this and a bitch this paid
Shit, what could a ho say?
The bag so expensive, my pussy came with it
Body so nice, they be sayin', "Who did it?"
But everything natural, actual, factual
Prissy in the streets, but I fuck like an animal
All you hoes know who the fuck I am
From your boyfriend down to my Instagram
To all them busted-ass hoes that you kick it with
I bet your jaw drop if you ever see me, bitch

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

Bitch, you do you and whatever that is, I'ma do it better
Hoes must've just seen me and they playin' catch-up
Bitches lookin' like lil' Megans playin' dress-up
Would I ever spin the block on a nigga? Never
I don't even wear an outfit twice, dead 'em
Any bitch got a problem? Probably never met 'em
Tell a hater kiss both cheeks, ciao, bella
But I'm used to the chatter 'cause

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

All this hate givin' me a pretty face
I eat hate, that's why I ain't got a waist
The more hoes hatin', more money I'ma make
And the more niggas talk, more niggas want a taste
'Cause I'm the most sickenin', hoes so fuckin' sick of me
No matter what they do or say, it ain't no gettin' rid of me
I come in every room and draw attention like a centerpiece
Steppin' for a long time, movin' like a centipede
I ain't scared of shit, man or bitch
To everybody hatin', y'all could suck this clit
'Cause the hate campaign ain't workin' at all
I ain't Jack or Jill, bitch, I ain't gon' fall

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me

I'm a bad bitch, and I got bad anxiety
People call me rude 'cause I ain't lettin' 'em try me
Sayin' I'm a ho 'cause I'm in love with my body
Issues, but nobody I could talk to about it
They keep sayin' I should get help
But I don't even know what I need
They keep sayin' speak your truth
And at the same time say they don't believe, man
Excuse me while I get into my feelings for a second
Usually I keep it down, but today I gotta tell it
Not that anybody gives a fuck anyway
But everybody talkin' shit probably sucks anyway
Y'all don't even know how I feel
I don't even know how I deal
Today I really hate everybody
And that's just me bein' real, yeah

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Bad bitches have bad days too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, bounce back
How a bad bitch always do
All I really wanna hear is "it'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
All I really wanna hear is "it'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days

If I could write a letter to Heaven
I would tell my mama that I shoulda been listenin'
And I would tell her sorry that I really been wildin'
And ask her to forgive me, 'cause I really been tryin'
And I would ask please, show me who been real
And get 'em from around me if they all been fake
It's crazy how I say the same prayers to the Lord
And always get surprised about who he take, man
I'm really thinkin' 'bout dialin' 911 'til I freak
'Cause they probably won't think it's that deep
And I don't do drugs, so I never get a time when I'm at ease
I can't even handle smokin' weed
Marilyn Monroe, my favorite ho
My favorite bad bitch, I think she the GOAT
Jammin' to Britney, singin' to Whitney

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

Baby, I'm the sweetest
Pussy is the meanest
Hot girl shit, but I'm cold every season
Know he got that pipe, let him bust it till it's leakin'
Booty like a pillow, he can use it while he sleepin'
Look, don't be goin' through my phone 'cause that's the old me
Ain't the only one tryna be my one and only
Real big, movin' slow, that body like codeine
He a player, but for Megan he cuttin' the whole team
That body lookin' nice
I got cake and I know he want a slice
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice
I ain't ever had to chase dick in my life
I want that nasty, that freaky stuff
Slid up under my bed and keep me up
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud I got some space for you
Got a taste for you
Ay

More bounce to the ounce
Pick it up, put it down
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round
Pussy tighter than a bitch
He ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they throwin' gang signs on Crip
One thing about me, I ain't takin' no shit
He will, I know it's pissin' off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained
Trouble at the top, now who really runnin' things?
(Who? Ah)

You've never been to Heaven, have you?

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

Real hot girl shit
Me and Dua Lipa finna get the party lit
Ah
