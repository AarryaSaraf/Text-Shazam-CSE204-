// The Sign //

Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?
I've been home since 2020
I've been twerking and making smoothies
It's called healing

And I feel better since you've seen me last
I've been training, I can flex that ass
So when I shake it, I can shake it fast
Make that camera flash, camera flash, camera flash

// Special //

Special

Woke up this morning to somebody in a video, talking
About something I posted in a video
If it wasn't me then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm Black and heavy?
Y'all don't hear me though

I've been the same since I've been driving slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new but I been used to people judging me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect
Special

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you can cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change
How could you throw fucking stones, if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so ashamed

I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect

I know that I'm not alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad)
Broken but damn, you're still perfect (So glad, so glad, so glad)
Special
You are, you are, you are so
Special

// Break Up Twice //

I talked to my girl friends yesterday
They reminded me of when you had me crying in my car
And when you came to my barbecue
They all gave you attitude, well shoot
Every reason they mad at you is true

But we promised to make up
Even if it's gonna take us
All of our lives
I'm willing to give it another try
We need to do this like
Love's on the line
This time

Boy, you know you better
Ooh, you know you better
Boy, you know you better
Watch out
'Cause boy, you know me better
You know me so much better
You know that I don't break up twice

And my love so good, it hurts
You make it work 'cause you know my worth
And I can have any man I want
But I never had nobody with a love like you
It will be a shame not to see this through
Who gonna put up with your gemini shit like I do

And we promised to make up
Even if it's gonna take us
All of our lives
I'm willing to give it another try
We need to do this like
Love's on the line
Real love, it takes time

Boy, you know you better
Ooh, you know you better
Boy, you know you better
Watch out
'Cause boy, you know me better
You know me so much better

You know that I don't break up, you know that I don't break up twice (Takes time)
Ooh, ooh (Takes time)
Oh, oh (Takes time)
Boy, you know you better (Takes time, takes time)
You know that I don't break up twice

// Naked //

Welcome to my body, I know it's nice to meet it
Fantasies been written 'bout the beauty and the sweetness
Can I be discreet with you? Will you keep all my secrets?
I just wanna lay it down and open up the deepness

All the conversations say I should feel a way
I don't care what people think or spend or sway
We can run away (Yeah)
Let down my guard
Undo my robe
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes

I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred
I'm a big girl, can you take it?
Naked

Beauty is a gift, but curses everyone that chase it
I wish we could live without no body expectations
I've seen every part of me and, babe, I can't erase it
If I get on top of you, you promise to embrace it?

Let down my guard (Let down my guard)
Undo my robe (Undo my robe)
I'm standin' here
Don't need no clothes

I'm naked
Love how you look at me naked
Come make this body feel sacred

Naked

// If You Love Me //

Ooh
I've learned to love me as myself
But when I'm with somebody else
I question everything I know
How can you say I'm beautiful?

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid
'Cause if you love me, you love all of me
Or none of me at all

I accept the things that I can't change about you
But can't accept the fact that I can't change myself too
Wish I could fall in love with me so easily like you did
Being good to me like I am someone else seems so back-handed

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid, oh
If you love me, you love all of me
Or none of me at all

Everything the light touches
All, baby, give me light touches

When the world can't love me to my face
When the mirror lies and starts to break
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid (Oh, yes)
When the world can't look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
When the darkness takes over my mind (Takes over my mind)
Hold me close, don't let me run away (Don't you be afraid, no, no, no, no, no)

When the rain falls and I'm locked outside
While your feet, they're standing by my side (Standing by my side)
Hold me close, don't let me run away
Don't be afraid, no, no
If you love me, you love all of me
And if you love me, you love all of me
Or none of me at all

If you love me
If you love me
If you love me

// Coldplay //

Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do, and everything you do

In Tulum, we pretend we're married
And that little tiny house was a home
It was so freeing, to know that we made it
To know that I never ever, will be alone

All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leaving the world behind with you, ooh

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)

Going to sleep, holding hands at the sunrise
Waking up, holding hands in the rain
I feel so goofy, I don't really do this
But with you is healing how I feel pain

It made me sad, I cried
Singing Coldplay in the night
Dancing to no music just feels right with you, ooh

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)
And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)

My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real
It's easy to cut you down, while I close me up
Instead of telling you how I feel

And we waited so long, but the sex is so good
Five years in the making, didn't know if we would
Do you say this shit to other people? I don't think that I could
I don't think that I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think that I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think I could, I don't think that I could

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)
And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)

// A Very Special Message From Lizzo //

So here we are
You are finally able to listen to this album I've working on it for three years and I know it's been a long time and it's about damn time I put it out. But you have to know that I took my time for me but I also took my time for you. I wrote almost 170 songs for this album to find this perfect twelve songs to bring to you because I felt like this was not only I needed to hear but you needed to hear and the whole world needs to hear. These are songs about love, whether self-love, love your family, love your friends, or love for significant other. I really believe that love for one self and for others is what this world needs to be a better place. If you can take just the time to give a little love to yourself every single day, treat yourself with respect, treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated and then treat somebody else the same love or respect that expands, that grows and that can save a life. It saved my life so many times and I'm so honored to be a part of your life, I hope you enjoy the music, I hope you cry, laugh, dance, twerk, do the split, do whatever you wanna do. I'm honored to be doing it with you so thank you for listening to Special, loving Special and being special cause if you don't take nothing away from this album I want you to know you're special and I'm so glad you're still with us. Thank you
