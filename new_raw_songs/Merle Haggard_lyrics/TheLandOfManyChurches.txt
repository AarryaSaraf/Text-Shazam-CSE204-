// Introduction / We'll Understand It Better By And By //

Trials dark on every hand
And we cannot understand
All the ways of God would lead us
To that blessed promised land
But he guides us with his eye
And we'll follow till we die
For we'll understand it better by and by

By and by, when the morning comes
When the saints of God are gathered home
We'll tell the story how we've overcome
For we'll understand it better by and by

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares
And our hearts are made to bleed
For a thoughtless word or deed
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best
But we'll understand it better by and by

By and by, when the morning comes
When the saints of God are gathered home
We'll tell the story how we've overcome
For we'll understand it better by and by

// Medley: Take My Hand, Precious Lord / Jesus Hold My Hand //

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord lead me home

As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ at Calvary

This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

Jesus hold my hand
I need thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land
Protect me by thy power

Hear my feeble plea
O Lord, look down on me
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

Jesus hold my hand
I need thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land
Protect me by thy power

Hear my feeble plea
O Lord, look down on me
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

// Precious Memories //

Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred past unfold

Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Fly accross the lonely years
And the home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious sacred scenes unfold

// Turn Your Radio On //

Come and listen to a radio station where the mighty hosts of heaven sing
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
If you want to hear the songs of Zion coming from the land of endless spring
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on, heaven's glory share
Turn the lights down low and listen to the Master's radio
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Listen to the songs of the fathers and the mothers
And the many friends gone before, turn your radio on, turn your radio on
Some eternal morning we shall meet them over on the Hallelujah shore
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on, heaven's glory share
Turn the lights down low and listen to the Master's radio
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

// If We Never Meet Again //

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separations comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separations comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

// Closing Prayer / Just As I Am //

Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee, oh lamb of God I come I come

// Amazing Grace //

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught me how to live
And grace my fears relieved
How blessed, how blessed, the son of God
The hour I first believe

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see

// Where Could I Go //

Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore
Where could I go but to the Lord

Where could I go, oh where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go but to the Lord

Neighbors are kind, I love them everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I face the chilling hand of death
Where could I go but to the Lord

Where could I go, oh where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go but to the Lord

Where could I go, oh where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go but to the Lord

// Medley: Old Time Religion / Pass Me Not / Sweet By And By //

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
It's good enough for me

Pass me not, O gentle Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
It's good enough for me

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
It's good enough for me

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me

Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
Makes me love everybody
It's good enough for me

// On The Jericho Road //

As you travel along on the Jericho Road
Does the world seem all wrong and heavy your load
Just bring it to Christ, your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart will be blessed

On the Jericho Road there's room for just two
No more and no less just Jesus and you
Each burden He'll bear, each sorrow He'll share
There's never a care for Jesus is there

Oh, brother to you this message I bring
Though hope may be gone He'll cause you to sing
At Jesus' command sins shackles must fall
On the Jericho Road will you answer His call

On the Jericho Road there's room for just two
No more and no less just Jesus and you
Each burden He'll bear, each sorrow He'll share
There's never a care for Jesus is there
On the Jericho Road

// Steal Away //

Steal away, steal away
Steal away to Jesus
Steal away, steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here

I was walkin' in Savannah, passed the church decayed and dimed
When there's slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
And a sympathy awakened an' a wonder quickly grew
Till I found myself seat in a little negro pew

Out at front a young couple sat in sorrow, nearly wild
And on the altar was a coffin and in the coffin lay a child
Rows of sad old negro preacher at his little wooden desk
With a manner grandly awkward with the countless grotesque

And he said now don't be weepin' for this little bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there he done gone and run away
He's was doin' very finely and he appreaciated your love
But it's sure enough father want him in the large house up above

Now he didn't give you that baby by a hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lend it for awhile
He let you keep and love it till your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you have shed that's just interest on the loan

So my poor dejected mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go criticizein' no one the one that knows the best
He gives us many comforts he's ever right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory now and ever, let us pray

My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here

// I Saw The Light //

I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

// Guide Me, Lord //

I was born in sin and lost but Jesus paid the cost
And pardoned me from all iniquity
So till I see His face I'll daily ask His grace
To guide me on the path He planned for me

Guide me Lord through the day, guide me Lord this I pray
Through all hardships temptation and strife
Guide me Lord through Thy might, guide me Lord by Thy light
That Thy will might be done in my life

God loved us everyone and He gave His only son
To save our souls from sin He gladly died
So trust in Him today and He'll wash your sins away
Then daily He will be your light and guide

Guide me Lord through the day, guide me Lord this I pray
Through all hardships temptation and strife
Guide me Lord through Thy might, guide me Lord by Thy light
That Thy will might be done in my life

Guide me, Lord

// I'll Be Listening //

When the Savior calls I will answer
When He calls for me I will hear
When the Savior calls I will answer
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
I'll be somewhere list'ning

If my robe is white when He calls me
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

// Just A Closer Walk With Thee //

I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me will be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy Kingdom's shore, to Thy shore

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
