Album: SingMeBackHome

// Sing Me Back Home //

The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
"Let my guitar playing friend do my request." (Let him...)

Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers "There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?"

Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die

Sing Me Back Home before I die

// Look Over Me //

If some time we're thrown together by our friends
And we're forced to see each other once again
I may lose control inspite of how I try
Please look over me while I cry.

If I'm fool enough to keep on loving you
After all the grief and heartache I've been through
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry.

Pretend you're not aware of how you torture me
And with your help maybe no one else will notice me
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry.

Pretend you're not aware of how you torture me
And with your help maybe no one else will notice me
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry...

// Son Of Hickory Holler's Tramp //

Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp.

Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry
When daddy took to drinking
Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away
Then Momma shed a silent tear
And promised fourteen children
"I swear you'll never see a hungry day."

When Momma sacrificed her pride
The neighbours started talking
But we were much too young
To understand the things they said
All we really cared about
Was Momma's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss
Before we went to bed.

Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp.

When Daddy left and destitution
Came upon our family
Not one neighbour volunteered
To lend a helping hand
So just let 'em gossip all they want
She loved us, and she raised us
The proof is standing here
A full grown man.

Last summer Momma passed away
And left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is
More than grateful for their birth
And each Sunday she receives
A big bouquet of fourteen roses
With a card that reads
'The Greatest Mom on Earth.'

Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp...

// Wine Take Me Away //

Warm red wine you know that place where you take me some times
Where my caress have wings and fly right off my shoulder
Where I leave my cares behind and for a while find peace of mind
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

When my life becomes a grime and when I'm weary and tired
Then I'll tell myself I need a short vacation
I gotta leave this lonely town and you're the quickest way I found
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Help me friend of mine wine take me away...

// If You See My Baby //

If you see my baby while making your rounds
In some crowded nightspot or cafe in town
Tell her I miss her and I'm still around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town.

Tell her to call me when she's all alone
'Cause I'm always waitin' by my telephone
I'd still worship the ground where she walks around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town.

Tell her to call me when she's all alone
'Cause I'm always waitin' by my telephone
I'd still worship the ground where she walks around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town...

// Where Does The Good Times Go //

Where does the good times go
Where does the river flow
Where does the north wind blow
Where does the good times go

Lips that used to burn with love
Now are cold beneath my touch
Still I love you oh so much
Where does the good times go

Where does the good times go
Where does the river flow
Where does the north wind blow
Where does the good times go

Arms that used to hold me tight
Eyes that shone with love so bright
Now have changed like day to night
Where does the good times go

Where does the good times go
Where does the river flow
Where does the north wind blow
Where does the good times go
Where does the good times go

// I'll Leave The Bottle On The Bar //

A loser doesn't always know he's losing
Till he's lost the game and it's too late to win
I hope I'll call in time and you'll forgive me
Cause I want so much to come back home again.

And I'll leave the bottle on the bar
If you'll take me back to start anew
I'll leave the bottle on the bar
I'll sober up and come back home to you.

I stood by and let the bottle come between us
And I let it through me time and time again
Before I thought the wine was all I needed
But now I see just what a fool I've been.

And I'll leave the bottle on the bar
If you'll take me back to start anew
I'll leave the bottle on the bar
I'll sober up and come back home to you...

// My Past Is Present //

The girl I love so much just walked in the door
My past is present but she's not mine anymore
Did she stop by to hurt me or does she even know I'm here
My past is present it'd be that she still cares.

For without her there's no future she's close yet far away
I keep hoping that my tomorrows will catch up with yesterday
For time has stopped my world has stopped since she went away
My past is present I just hope she's back to stay.

For time has stopped my world has stopped since she went away
My past is present I just hope she's back to stay...

// Home Is Where A Kid Grows Up //

It may be down the south in Alabama
Or maybe just a little old one horse town
It could be on the back streets of Chicago
But if it's home it's still the greatest place around.

Home's where a kid grows up'
And spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be
No matter how far away.

There may be an old sweetheart still there waitin'
Can't tell I might even find a few old friends
I know my mom and dad would like to see me
And know I want so much to go back home again.

Home's where the kid grows up
And spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be
No matter how far away.

It may be down the south in Alabama...

// Good Times //

Now I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today.

And I want to talk about the leavin'
If you want to beg me to stay
I wanna live just for the moment
And everything is going my way.

And I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today.

I'm not gonna save any money
I'm gonna spend every dime I can
And I'll buy you everything that money can buy
While the good times are here at hand.

And I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today...

// Seeing Eye Dog //

Well, I'm gonna get me a seeing eye dog to help me find my way
I'm so much in love with you I can't even see the light of day
My mind is cloudy like a winter storm before the rain come pourin' down
I feel so good and I gotta get my feet on the ground on the ground.

Well. I'm walkin' real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometime I wanna holler out loud
Well I'm gonna take me a comin' down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I gotta get my feet on the ground on the ground.

Well. I'm walkin' real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometime I wanna holler out loud
Well I'm gonna take me a comin' down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I gotta get my feet on the ground on the ground...
