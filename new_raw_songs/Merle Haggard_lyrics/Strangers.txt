Album: Strangers

// (My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers //

Oh, the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned by back and you were gone

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through, ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that would be true
Why I should be taken out and tarred and feathered?
To have let myself be taken in by you

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through, ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone

// Falling For You //

You bring me happiness and leave me loneliness
My world is in distress 'cause I'm falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise and I'm falling for you

Oh, darling when you're near, my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear, I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's all a mystery
Why I'm falling for you

Oh, darling when you're near, my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear, I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's all a mystery
Why I'm falling for you

// Please Mr. D.J. //

Hello Mr. D.J. wont you play a song for me'
The girl I love just said good-by and I'm blue as I can be
Oh please Mr. D.J. play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today

You won't have to call her name she'll know it's meant for her
Play me that song of sadness and I'll be grateful to you sir
Oh please Mr. D.J. play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today

You won't have to call her name she'll know it's meant for her
Play me that song of sadness and I'll be grateful to you sir
Oh please Mr. D.J. play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today

// Sing A Sad Song //

Sing me a song of sadness 
And sing it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear it's because she's not here 
Sing a sad song and sing it for me

She's unhappy with me she told me so 
I'm unhappy without her 
And I still love her so
Oh sing me a song of sadness 
Pretend it's the end of the world
Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me

Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me

// Sam Hill //

There's a certain hill outside of town called Sam Hill   
And a certain guy used to go there every day     
They said a certain girl lived up in Sam Hill     
Aw, a pretty girl, not hep to city ways

This certain guy would come down the hill a smilin'
Headed back to town at the crack of dawn
And he had 'em all a wonderin' what he was doin'   
Yeah, wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on

We knew this certain guy was not a goldminer       
Cause he never took a shovel or a pick  
He only took a little box of candy    
And disappeared in Sam Hill mighty quick

We tried to follow him to his destination    
But he had a secret path and soon he was gone      
And he had us all a wonderin' what he was doin'      
Yeah, wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on

I know that you have wondered too about Sam Hill       
You've probably asked "What in Sam Hill's goin' on?"   
All I can say in answer to your question    
Is the goin's on are still goin' on

This certain guy's still takin' up his candy    
He's 99 and all his youth is gone     
But he climbs that hill and still comes down a smilin'         
And we're wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on      
Wish I knew             
What in Sam Hill's goin' on        
He won't tell us'       
What in Sam Hill's goin' on      
He just snickers       
What in Sam Hill's goin' on

// I'm Gonna Break Every Heart I Can //

I'm gonna break every heart I can 
I'd be a find-'em-and-fool-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna think of lotta good lies
I'm gonna laugh when a woman cries
I'm gonna have myself a style to recognize
I'm gonna travel all around the world 
I'd be a friend to the sweetest girl
I'm gonna break every heart I can 
And all my name ain't Merle

Well if I ever get around to you 
You gonna know about the things I do
They gonna tell about the harm 
I've done in the latest News
Cause if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart 
I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can 
I'd be a love-'em-and-leave-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan

Well if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find

// You Don't Even Try //

Our love keeps drifting and you keep giving me to blame
I go on loving you although it's all in vain
Now you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try

I've done all I can do and I'm standin' at the end
Although I know it's over my heart just won't give in
So you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try

I've done all I can do and I'm standin' at the end
Although I know it's over my heart just won't give in
So you stop carrying so what a chance have you and I
I give my everything but you don't even try

// I'd Trade All Of My Tomorrows //

I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good if I can't have your love
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's, they're worth less anyway
If I can't hold the one I'm dreamin' of

Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good without you anyhow

Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good without you anyhow

// The Worst Is Yet To Come //

Such a little time has passed since you went away
Where are all these heartaches coming from
I can hardly stand the pain of missing you today
And I know the worst is yet to come

If there was something I could find to drive these tears from me
Then I'd go right out and get me one
I've already cried enough to fill the deep blue sea
And I know the worst is yet to come

There'll be all those sleepless nights when I'll just lay and cry
And the hours seem to have no end
There'll be days when it won't matter if I live or die
Wishing I could have you back again

If there was something I could find to drive these tears from me
Then I'd go right out and get me one
I've already cried enough to fill the deep blue sea
And I know the worst is yet to come

// Walking The Floor Over You //

You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
That day has come and gone but you're still away from home
I'm walking the floor over you

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

Now darling, you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought you would love me and you always would be mine
You went away and left me here with troubles on my mind

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
