// Swinging Doors //

[Merle Haggard:]
This old smoke filled bar
Is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you
Satisfied
And I just called to let you know
Where I'd be living
It's not much
But I feel welcome here inside

[Chorus - Merle Haggard:]
I got swinging doors
And a jukebox
And a barstool
My new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me
Anytime you want to
Because I'm always here at home, till closing time

 Willie Nelson:]
Well, I got everything it takes
To drive me crazy
I've got everything I need
To lose my mind
And in here, the atmosphere
Is just right for it
And thanks to you
I'm always here till closing time

[Chorus - Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard:]
I got swinging doors
And a jukebox
And a barstool
My new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me
Anytime you want to
Because I'm always here at home, till closing time

// Somewhere Between //

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you

I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you

// Family Bible //

There's a family Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world
Of ours is full of trouble
And this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me
