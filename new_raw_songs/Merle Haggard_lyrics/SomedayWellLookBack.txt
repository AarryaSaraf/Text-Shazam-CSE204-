// Someday We'll Look Back //

Someday when our dream world finds us 
and these hard times are gone
We'll laugh and count our blessings
in a mansion all our own 
If we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come
Someday we'll look back and say it was fun

We live on love and pennies 
and the day dream out of sight
And I'm amazed the way you smile
when things don't turn out right
We climb each hill together each step one by one
And someday we'll look back and say it was fun

Someday when our dream world finds us 
and these hard times are gone
We'll laugh and count our blessings
in a mansion all our own 
If we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come
Someday we'll look back and say it was fun
And someday we'll look back and say it was fun

// Train Of Life //

I sit alone at my table and watch all the others have fun
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run
I'm tired of havin' no future, livin' on things that I've done
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life

I got no one to call me their darling, to hug me and call me their hon
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run
I'm tired of havin' no future, just livin' on things that I've done
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life, train of life

// One Sweet Hello //

One, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye
Two empty arms and these lonely nights to cry
Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye

These precious memories linger on
Haunting my mind since you're gone
These little things between us that really have no ties
Are all we have together and all we realize

Was one, sweet hello and one sad goodbye
Two, empty arms and these lonely nights to cry
Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye

Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye

// One Row At A Time //

The southeast Georgia red clay dust is groundin' to my blue jeans
A heavy hundred pound cotton sack draggin' along behind
Wanting to leave this place so bad, I forget how I got here
Workin' my way back home, one row at a time

It's a long old cotton road between here and Waco
Then, three days a-thumbin' through that California line
And two more days of pickin' to that house, just south of Fresno
Workin' my way back home, one row at a time

Mississippi delta mud is caked in layers on my brogans
Sunshine on snow white cotton, nearly makes me blind
I can almost see 'em now, a home folk runnin' out to meet me
Workin' my way back home, one row at a time

It's a long, old cotton road between here and Waco
Then, three days a-thumbin' through that California line, Lord, Lord
Two more days of pickin' to that house, just south of Fresno
Workin' my way back home, one row at a time
Workin' my way back home, one row at a time

// Big Time Annie's Square //

I came back to find my Annie'd moved away
To some town in California close in something somewhere close to east LA
Don't think finding her was easy cause something sure had changed my Tulsa girl
But I came here to show my love and try to understand her crazy world
I was thrilled because she treated me with joy
And was glad she still remembered
Well enough to know someone she called her boy
And I've heard about those sugar cutes before I ever came to find her there
I was glad to be excepted even though I've known as big time Annie's square
I'm just big time Annie's leaning post someone she can turn to now and then
Annie says I'm feeble but Annie's friends don't question
The square John known as big time Annie's friend

Well sometimes I feel happy through and through
And I always find excuses for anything my Annie wants to do
We don't agree on nothin' but I'll be dangled if we don't make the pair
My friends call her hippie and her friends call me big time Annie's square
I'm just big time Annie's leaning post...

// I'd Rather Be Gone //

I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you
And I can't understand this awful change you're going through
But lately, I've been watching you grow colder every day
And I'd rather be gone, than in your way

I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather see someone else here, in my place
And if I decide on leaving, my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone, than in your way

I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather see someone else here, in my place
And if I decide on leaving, my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather be gone

// California Cottonfields //

My driftin' memory goes back to the spring of '43,     
When I was just a child in momma's arms. 
My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave  
This run-down mortgaged Oklahoma farm.                        
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go.
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so.

California Cottonfields,     
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams.
California Cottonfields, 
As close to wealth as daddy ever came.

Nearly everything we had was sold or left behind,
From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned.
Some folks came to say farewell or see what all we had to sell;
Some just came to shake my daddy's hand.
That model A was loaded down and California bound;
A change of luck was just 4 days away.
But the only change that I remember seeing in my daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver grey.

California Cottonfields,     
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams.
California Cottonfields, 
As close to wealth as daddy ever came.

// Tulare Dust //

Tulare dust in a farm boy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standin' in the field by the railroad track 
Cursin' this strap on my cotton sack

I can see mom and dad with shoulders low 
Both of 'em pickin' on a double row
They do it for a livin' because they must 
That's life like it is in the Tulare dust

The California sun was something new 
That when we arrived in '42
And I can still remember how my daddy cussed
The tumbleweeds here in the Tulare dust

The wally fever was a comin' fate 
To the farmworkers here in the Golden State
And I miss Oklahoma but I'll stay 
If I must and help make a livin' in the Tulare dust

The Tulare dust in a farm boy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standin' in the field by the railroad track 
Cursin' this strap on my cotton sack

// Huntsville //

That old white haired judge in Dallas
Didn't pay my story no mind
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
I'm bringin' in a load of time

They caught me on a caper that I planned for days
And proved everything I done
I'm on my way to Huntsville 
Bt I'm looking for a chance to run

My hands don't fit no choppin' pole
And cotton never was my beg
The men better keep both eyes on me
Or they're gonna lose old Hag

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico 
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay

They got me chain and leg irons 
I guess they got a good excuse
They know I'm gonna run the first chance
I get cause they never gonna cut me loose

And I really don't care if they shoot me down
I'll never be free again
I've got two long life turns to do 
Both runnin' in the end

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico 
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
