Album: SoExcited

// I'm So Excited //

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night
I want to love you
Feel you
And wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you
I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around
Boy that's just fine

Let's get excited
We just can't hide it
No, no, no
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you
I want you

I want to love you
Feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you
I want you

I'm so excited
Look what you do to me
I just can't hide it
You got me burning up
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
I know I want you
I'm so excited
Look what you do to me
You got me burning up
I think I like it...

// See How The Love Goes //

I can hear somebody knockin'
At my bedroom door
I find it rather shockin'
It's my best friend's guy

Imagine my surprise
There's a hungry look in his eyes

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

He said, "I'm feelin' kinda lonely
And only you will do
Would you like to get to know me
Like I wanna know you"

No tellin' what a girl would do
Face to face with somebody like you

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?
Oh yeah, see how the love goes

I can hear him calling
That no one understands him
He is beggin' me to let him in
And he's waiting for my answer

Should I open up the door
And let trouble walk in?
Should I resist him even more
Or tell him, come on in?

No tellin' what this girl would do
Face to face with somebody like you

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here

// All Of You //

If you hold my love up to the light
And you see everything that can be yours tonight
Would you lay your heart out on the line
And give me anything that my heart can find

But don't ever stop believing
You won't end up breaking even

I don't want everything you have
I don't want everything that's true
I don't want everything
Just give me, just give me all of you

I don't want everything you have
I don't want everything that's true
I don't want everything
Just give me, just give me all of you

If you make a promise in the dark,
Could you make it to anyone?
Could you make it from the heart?
Well, I'm not just anyone, baby
And you better know for sure
That if you want all of me, it might take something more

But don't ever stop believing
You won't end up breaking even

[Chorus x2]

Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you

Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you

Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you

// Heart Beat //

Well we've sat around and talked for hours,
And I've really nothing left to say,
I just wish you'd open up as well,
As you hide your heart away.

Say what you want say what you will right now,
I think I know you better than you know yourself,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Save it all for somebody else.

I can feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Playing what you live to feel,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
And it tells me how you really feel.

You remind me of a lonely child,
Who's been hurt by love before,
Honey I've been down that road myself,
And there's one thing that I found for sure.

You're holding back you'll miss it all you take your chances,
That's the only way to go,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Come and let your feelings show.

I can feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Even now as you deny your fire,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat,
Moving to the rhythm of your true desire.

You're holding back you'll miss it all you take your chances,
That's the only way to go,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Come and let your feelings show.

Listen to your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Playing what you live to feel,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
And it tells me how you really feel.

Heart beat, heart beat baby,
Even now as you deny your fire,
Yeah heart beat, heart beat,
Moving to the rhythm of your true desire.

Heart beat, heart beat baby,
Heart beat, heart beat baby.

// If You Wanna Get Back Your Lady //

If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do

If you wanna get back your lady
Communicate for real, hey baby
Or ain't no way your lady's gonna find out
How you really feel, ooh

I was a young shy girl
I thought I found my world in you the day we met
You were so cool and wise
One look into your eyes and my heart started gettin' upset

Never had no trouble tellin' you I love you
But you never did me the same
You kept it all inside as if you had to hide your love
And that's a cryin' shame

Now we're apart, what can I do?
But get this message straight to you

If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh, yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do

Hey, baby

Take some time and figure out
If I'm the one you really miss
It's gettin' 4 a.m. and I'm lyin' here again
And I can't take much more of this

Didn't mean to hurt you, walk out and desert you
But I didn't know what else to do
It's just the chance I'm takin', hopin' I can wake you up
To what I'm goin' through

If you could find a way to start
The door's still open to my heart

If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do

If you wanna get back your lady
Communicate for real, hey baby
Or ain't no way your lady's gonna find out
How you really feel, ooh

If you wanna get back your lady
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh baby
If you wanna get back your lady
Now what can I do?

// I Feel For You //

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (For you girl)

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Play

I think it's love
I feel for you
I think it's love
I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think it's love

Play

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

// Heart To Heart //

Are those your arms squeezin' me to pieces?
Are those your lips pressin' next to mine?
Can you explain how we ever got here like this
Love is taking over
Now we can't get any closer

So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart

Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart
As long as we stay, ooh baby, heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts

My, oh my, where'd you learn to do that?
I'll surely die long before you're through
I've never dreamed, I've never dreamed
I could ever get you like this
When your body meets mine
It's a feeling of a lifetime

So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart

[Keyboard solo]

Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart

Heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts
(Ahhh, ahhh)

Heart to heart (Heart, heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Heart to heart (We got each other, baby)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Heart to heart (We are heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Gotta heart to heart)
Heart to heart (gotta heart, gotta heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)

// American Music //

Well, the rock still rolls
The beat goes on after all of this time
The faces change but the song's the same
So roll over Mister Dylan for the next in line

They want American music for drivin' with the radio
She said, I know that I would be alright
If I could just make somebody my baby tonight

American music for dancin' with the stereo
Oh do what you like feel what you feel
The music is right
Well, it almost feels real American

From the purple peaks to the city streets
People searching for the rock and roll scene
The power of the pounding beat
The magic in the dream

They want American music for travelin' with the radio
She said, I know that I would be alright
If I could just make somebody my baby tonight

American music for dancin' with the stereo
Oh do what you like feel what you feel
The music is right
Well, it almost feels real American

Just when you think that you've heard enough
Well, somebody say turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
