// Who Do You Love //

I walked miles of barbed wire, use a cobra snake for a necktie
Got a brand-new house on the roadside, made from rattlesnake hide
Got a brand-new chimney made on top, made from a human skull
Come on, Robbie, let's take a little walk, tell me who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Arlene took me by the hand,
Says "Who are you, Ricky? I understand"

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Come on, Robbie! I got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
I've turned I don't mind dyin'

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I ride around the county and use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy, Garth, don't you give me no lip

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

// All Your Love //

Easy days, when we can just relax
Easy days, that's when love can make you feel
That life is for real
We're just dreamin' and hopin' that someday soon

We'll have those easy days when we can lay around
And let the children play
And let choirs of angel sing our love to the world

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

When the sky's blue above and you're happy
Dreamin' of who you love but you only
Make believe he is near
There so much for you to see, do and go here
So relax your mind I'm sure you'll find

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

Easy days, sitting there all alone
Easy days, no one rings a telephone
They think you're not home
And you're glad that they could not get through it
And give you just one maybe two of those easy days

// Dreaming As One //

The morning dove singing
Her sweet lullaby
Her love is still thinking
Of how he replied
As I reach for you
You open your eyes
As if somehow you knew
The need in my life
As you always do
Slowly you come
And though we sleep as two
We're dreaming as one, dreaming as one

A child in his slumber
His world is at rest
I never wonder
Why I'm so blessed
As I lie with you
Awaking this day
I give my thoughts to you
I silently pray
That love will see us through
From darkness 'til dawn
Though we sleep as two
We're dreaming as one, dreaming as one
Oh now baby, dreaming as one,
Oh yeah, dreaming as one
Oh it feels so good, it feels so good sometimes
Wake up in the morning, just to wake up in the morning
And find you here beside me
I need you, baby, I need you, baby, oh yes
Oh it feels so good in the morning sometimes
Sometimes I just can't keep from crying

// Turned Up Too Late //

When you get inside my head
It just goes empty
With all that junk I been fed
You think I'd let you get me

Hey baby what are you blind
How long you been gone
I'm not the returning kind
I don't need you to lean on

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late

If you were the sun and moon
I'd still cloud over
Rain would still fall down too soon
And we would just grow colder

Hey baby I ain't ashamed
Of being turned down
I hope you got the same strength
You're gonna need it now

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late

Love takes a toll on ev'ryone Baby
You're gonna find out someday
It don't feel too good
It don't feel too great to tell you
It's turned up too late

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late
Turned up too late

// Happy //

Well I never kept a dollar past sunset
It always burned a hole in my pants
Never made a school mama happy
Never blew a second chance

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy

Always took candy from strangers
Didn't wanna get me no trade
Never want to be like papa
Working for the boss ev'ry night and day

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy

Never got a flash out of cocktails
When I got some flesh off the bone
Never got a lift out of Lear jets
When I can fly way back home

I need a love to keep me happy
I need a love to keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy
Baby, baby keep me happy

// Blind Faith //

Do you remember
Back in '64
You came knocking
Knocking on my door

Yeah, you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

I was such a young girl
I was so green
You were so experienced
You know what I mean

Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad

You said I never thanked you
For everything you'd done
Had to do a lot of walking
Before I could run

Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad, yes it did
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Oh! Blind faith was all

Yeah yeah

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad, yes it did
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad

// Don't Let A Thief Steal Into Your Heart //

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

How many days does a man think he has
That he can spend his whole time dreamin'
How many schemes is one man thinkin' of
And does he think he's the only one scheming

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Stop your lies and stop your cheating
It never did you no good, no good
How can you say you will when you want to
When you know you never would if you could

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Everyone is in love with money
Strange news 'cause they say that love is blind
How many times did you meet somebody
Who said they had some real peace of mind

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

// (She Got) The Fever //

When I get home from my job
I turn on the T.V.
But I can't keep my mind
On the show
When I lay down at night
I don't get no sleep
So I turn on the radio
But Lord the only thing
I hear is you
Whispering in my ear
The words that you used to say
Well now the days grow longer
My love grows stronger
The fever gets worse every day

I got the fever for this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Nothing that a girl can do
When she's got the fever
For this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Left this little girl blue

I used to see you walking home
I'd be standin' at the stove
With the dishes on the table
Dinner ready to go
Or maybe we'd o to a movie show
Something that you'd like to see
Oh you were my sun in the mornin'
You were my moon at night
When I think about it
Makes me feel alright
Well now the days grow longer
And my love grows stronger
And the fever gets so bad at night

I got the fever for this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Nothing that a girl can do
When she's got the fever
For this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Left this little girl blue

// The Shape I'm In //

Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Has anybody seen my lady
This living alone will drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I'm gonna go down by the water
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be looking for my maker
And I hear that that's where she's been? Oh!

Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I just spent 60 days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you trying to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
