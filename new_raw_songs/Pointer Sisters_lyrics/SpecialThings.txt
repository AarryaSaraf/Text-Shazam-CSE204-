// Could I Be Dreaming //

Through the night while I was fast asleep
I could feel you touching me
Felt like a dream
Then I slowly opened my eyes
You were laying by my side
Oh, what a night!
Could I be dreamin'?
Are you really with me, are you right
Here by my side?
Could I be dreamin'?
I've waited for this moment oh so long
And now you're mine
No, it's not a dream
Boy, you know I like your company
And I'm glad you said to me
"Baby, can I come inside?"
Aren't you glad I opened up my door
Because we both knew the score
And the time was right
No, I'm not dreamin'
You're really, really with me and I love
The way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment oh so long

And now it's real
No, it's not a dream
Life will come to show that
All things come and go but
I'm sure glad to know
I've got you here, and I love the feeling
So sincere, your love has got me spinning
I'm not dreamin'
You're really, really here with me and I love
The way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment oh so long
And now it's here
I should be screamin', Oh
Telling everybody just how good
You make me feel
No, I'm not dreamin', no
I've got you here beside me and this time
My love is real
Could I be dreamin'?
Or are you really with me, are you right
Here in my arms?
No, I'm not dreamin'
I love you, I love you from this moment on

// He's So Shy //

When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully

And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by, oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine

He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy
That I'll love him 'till the day I die

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
I said, he's so shy, he's so shy
That I'll love him 'till the day I die, oh yeah

And he's so shy
He's so shy
He's so shy
He's so shy

// The Love Too Good To Last //

Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinking about you
Here comes the rain
I don't know how to explain to you
What it feels like living without you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had The Love Too Good To Last
It burned too hot too fast
Too good to last
The best of love gone bad
Ain't it a shame

No one's to blame
What if I swear in the name of you
Could you see I need to be with you
Won't you come back
Feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had The Love Too Good To Last
It burned too hot too fast
Too good to last
The best of love gone bad
Ain't it a shame

No one's to blame
(No one)
What if I swear in the name of you
(What if I swear)
Could you see I need to be with you

Won't you come back
(I need you, I need you)
Feeling the hurt from the lack of you
Could we save this love too good to last
(Oh, hey)

Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinking and thinking about you

Won't you come back
I'm feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you
(Wanna give you, Wanna give you, Oh)

Won't you come back
(Won't you come back)
I'm feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you
(Wanna give you, Wanna give you, Oh)

// Evil //

Pretty poison, turns the girls on
And his kiss sure are nice
But he only wants you for just a minute
Then his lips turn cold as ice

He's evil, evil
Evil, he stole my love from me
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah...

Tryin' to shake him will only make him
Hold on tighter till you yield
His love's like quicksand
So you sink down and
He goes on to play the field

He's evil, evil
He stole your love from you
He's so evil, evil
But I know what to do

I'll be your lover, agent undercover
I'll find a way to break your heart of steel
You'll get a taste of your pretty poison
Soon you'll see how evil love can feel

Evil, evil
You stole my love from me
Yes, I'm evil, evil
I'll steal your love from you
You're evil, evil...

// Save This Night For Love //

Save this night for love- just me and you
When the darkness falls
We'll melt into the shadows of our fantasies
And leave them dancing on the wall

Make this night the one that never ends
And all we're dreaming of
Tracing every moment for remembering
In colors made from shades of love

Save this night for love
(Have ya ever been to heaven, baby)
Save this night for love
(We're gonna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

Save this night for love- let no one in
We'll take it on our own
And with our bodies pressing hard and closing in
We'll hang on 'til we can't go on

Save this night for love
(Can you feel the magic, baby)
Save this night for love
(We're gonna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

I can't hide what I'm feelin'
Wanna let it go all the way
Your love is the reason
And I can't enough of your touch and your taste

Save this night for love- and let it sing
In echoes with no end
We'll take it further, baby, sharing everything
Go back and do it all again

Save this night for love
(Let's go to heaven, baby)
Save this night for love
(I wanna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

Save this night for love
(I feel the magic, baby)
Save this night for love
(Late in the midnight hour)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

// We've Got The Power //

I know the rules for foolish games
They only fill a heart with pain
We need a rest, a change of pace
Come take my heart to a silent place
Where our dreams run wild
The simple joy of a little child lives here
Telling us to hold on a little longer

We can climb a mountain
To the top of the world
We've got the power
We've got the power
To take us anywhere we wanna go

We can live forever
At the top of the world
We've got the power
We've got the power
To live our dreams chasing after rainbows

With what we have is where we start
And what we build or tear apart
Depends on what we gain or lose
What we reject and what we choose
When I see your smile
The simple joy of a baby child is born
Reminding us to hold on a little longer

We can climb a mountain
To the top of the world
We've got the power
We've got the power
To take us anywhere we wanna go

We can live forever
At the top of the world
We've got the power
We've got the power
To live our dreams chasing after rainbows

// Where Did The Time Go //

Hey you, where did the time go
Never saw it passin' by me
You knew how to occupy me
Hey darlin'
Where did the time go
Never let a moment linger
Wrapped me up around your finger

Fools say anyone who ever loved
Someone like you and me
Anyone who ever loves becomes too blind
To see the time go by
And I'm tellin' you that I'm searchin'

Where did the time go
Ev'ry day became about you
Till I couldn't do without you
Where did our lives go
Slipped away without me knowing
Sure knew how to keep me goin'

// Special Things //

Special things from far away
Far beyond the dream
It was not so long ago
Out of reach they seemed

They're closer, I can see them passing through
They cannot stay
Take from it what is needed
What they cost is what you pay

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

Special things from far away
I've thought them, time to see them now
Life is motion not display
Even special things leave somehow

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

It's important at the time
You created in your mind
But your heart will come to see
What you want may not be what you need

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

// Here Is Where Your Love Belongs //

When the morning comes
I find myself just missing you
I find myself just wishing you were
Laying by my side

As the day goes on
I'm wondering if you're missing me
I'm wondering if you're wishing we were
Laying side by side

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I'll get the message loud and clear

Let yourself come home
Forget the others, bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs

When my evening comes
I'm wishing I was kissing you
I'm fishing for the words to lay on you
To make it right, make it right

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I'll get the message loud and clear

Let yourself come home
Forget the others, bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs

// Movin' On //

Have you heard I've been asking about you
Have you heard I'm still here
Have you heard that your leaving brought me tears
But they disappeared
And I got myself together
Started all over now
There's a change in my life
And I'm so proud
I can face the crowd

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
I'll find love again

I was so foolish and excited
Made myself believe a lie
And unaware that love was open wide
I just thought I'd die
But I got myself together
Started all over, now
(Started over)
There's a change in my life
And I'm so proud
It makes me wanna shout out loud

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
I'll find love again
I'll find love again

And I'm never gonna stop
Until I've got
All the things in life I need
'Cause I just can't live
My life
On faded memories
And I'm movin' on my own
And getting closer to
A better side of me
Pushing harder than before
And making sure
That I don't get hurt no more
I'm

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
(I'm gonna keep)
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
Movin' on
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
(Gonna find it)
(I'm gonna)
(Move on)
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
