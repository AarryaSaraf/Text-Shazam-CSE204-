// Shut Up And Dance //

Hey you, you wanna dance?

All I want to do with you is dance
I don't need no verbal expose
Hey

I wanna dance, that's all I want
Ride on that rhythm flowin'
Take the train where it's going so fast
And don't look back

Just met not long ago
Music was steady jammin'
You're out there body slammin' so hard
Then came a rap

Ohh, I ain't come here to lookin' for no converstion
(I ain't lookin' for no conversation)
And I ain't searchin' for my, for my romeo
(I ain't searchin' for my romeo)

Don't ask me nothin', don't tell me nothin'
Don't talk about romance
Just wanna move, jam on the groove
All you gotta do is shut up and dance
(Shut up and dance)
Yea, yea, yeah

Ohh, all I want to do with you is groove
(All I wanna do with you is groove)
I don't need no verbal expose
(I don't need no verbal expose)

Just let me dance, that's all I want
Ride on that rhythm flowin'
Take the train where it's going so fast
And don't look back, Jack

Don't ask me nothin', don't tell me nothin'
Don't talk about romance
Just wanna move, jam on the groove
All you gotta do is shut up and dance
(Shut up and dance)
Yea, yea, yeah

It's hard to be groovin'
When your mouth always movin'
The strangest thing I've ever seen
It's tough to be rockin'
When your rocker talkin' now
Do you know what I mean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean?

Play it for me one time
Uh!
Yea, yea, yeah

There's one thing that bothers me
You don't get a second change
It's a big mistake tryin' to rap to me
While I'm on the beat, just shut up and dance (dance)
Yea, yea, yeah
Hey

Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance, romance
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance, romance

Shut up!
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance
Shut up!
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance
Shut up, uh!

Uh! Uh!

Shut up! (Shut up)
Shut up! (And dance)
Shut up! (Don't talk)
Shut up! (Romance)
Shut up!

// Moonlight Dancing //

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

Oh, nobody's going to be there
Oh, so don't you want to go where
we could dance across the sky and leave the world behind us
Nothing that we couldn't do
Yeah, we could dance across the sky and leave the world behind us
Just the moon and me and you
Just the moon and me and you

We could hide inside the rhythm 'til the morning finds us
Share a little ecstasy 
Yeah, we could hide inside the rhythm 'til the morning finds us
If you come away with me
I'll show you how it feels to be
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

Oh, we're going to sail on the wind
Oh, so don't you want to begin?

Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

// He Turned Me Out //

I walked down feelin' sad and confused
Just out lookin' for someone to use
Have to find somethin' sweet and complete
Let these high heels hit the street now

So I made my way to Tony's grill
That's a place where I could find a thrill
Saw a man who can fit the bill
I need love so bad I could kill

He took control of me
The heart and soul of me
He gave me such good love
Now he's all that I dream of

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

I never knew how good it could be
He turned out the light
And turned on the love in me
In a flash, he touched me so deep
No more secrets I could keep

He set a spark in me
He lit the dark in me
He got that magic stuff
Now I can't get enough

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He took control of me
The heart and soul of me
He gave me such good love
Now he's all that I dream of

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

// Flirtatious //

Woo, mm
Oh, I'm just a flirt

Did you think I was a naughty girl
For making eyes at you?
Perhaps a little stimulation, ooh
You thought I choose to do
What you consider me intimate
I was in your arms
You'll never get to read the benefits
It's nothing more than a false alarm

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will
I probably won't
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious
Ooh, I'm just a flirt

Don't believe you'll get the best of me
Because I smile a lot
There's something 'bout your personality
I guess I just forgot
That you respond to a physical
And not what's in the park
You rather make it all sensual
And nothing more than a pleasure in the dark

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will (what)
I probably won't
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious
Ooh, I'm just a flirt

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will (maybe I will)
I probably won't (don't do it, girl)
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious

Sorry if I hurt you
I didn't mean to turn you on
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little bit too much
I'm flirtatious
Look, don't touch
Flirtatious
You might want it all
Flirtatious
To the ball...

Flirtatious
I know you probably wanna feel
Flirtatious
But baby, let's be real
Flirtatious
You know you want it all night
Flirtatious
Touch me, we're gonna start a fight

// My Life (Remix) //

Now's the time
To lay it on the line, boy
You better believe it
You had your chance
To break it down and dance
But you blew it
By trying to tell me how to
Run my life
Look at me
Just sit down and think it over
Can't you see
That I wasn't born yesterday
Working girl
In a world full of confusion
Far too cool
To be taken for a fool
This is my life
And I'm livin' like I'm walkin'
Crazy high life
So you better learn how to play
Doin' that fast life
Got you going 'round in circles
This is my life
And I'm calling all the shots this time
Boys like you
I know the way you do
Waiting something for nothing
All talk, no work
Go ahead and do the jerk
'Cause you blew it
You'll never hold me with your gangster love
Look at me
It should be so elementary
Can't you see
You know that I'm no stranger to the street
Mama said
In a world full of confusion
Take control
You were never born to lose

// I'm In Love //

Times are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
Cause your woman is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around

[Chorus:]
I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work
No more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah

Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in it's corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same

[Chorus]

// Pride //

Respect, you want
You want my breathless adoration
Where's your dedication?
Hey, hey baby baby don't look now
but you're about to lose

'Cause you make me so mad
Sad and a feeling blue
And you make me lonely
All from a lovin' you
And it's getting so bad
My crying don't get through

[Chorus:]
And you just hold on to your, hold on to your
Pride, pride 
Dignity or vanity?
Do you know the meaning?
Pride, pride
When your love lies helplessly
pride can be, baby, such a lonely feeling

You want my love
but you don't give me the satisfaction
Where's my satisfaction?
Tell me - why should I give you everything you're looking for?

'Cause you make me so mad
Sad and a feeling blue
And you make me lonely
All from a lovin' you
And it's getting so bad
My crying don't get through

[Chorus]

So mad
Lonely
So bad

[Chorus x2]

// Uh-Uh //

My bags are packed and set by the door
Just waitin' for the time to go
No matter what you had to do
You could find a way to let me know

That's it, I've had enough
It's been too tough
I'm leavin' with the mornin' sun, yeah
I've never given you a reason why
To treat me like you do

So I'm tellin' you now, bye
I'm hurt that you didn't try
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh

We had a talk just last week
And I thought I made it pretty clear
Things had to change before too long
Or this love affair would disappear

But that's it, I've had enough
It's been too tough
Sorry, but I've gotta run, oh...
My heart seems to be breakin' inside
I've gotta go before I change my mind

So I'm tellin' you now, bye
I'm hurt that you didn't try
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Don't wanna talk about it, baby)
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Ooh!)

Maybe you finally believe
What I've been tellin' you
It takes more than just talking
You've got to do something new

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh

Uh-uh
Uh-uh

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Baby)

Uh-uh, whoo!

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh
(I can't take no more, baby, please)

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Gotta get away, yeah)
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Whoo-whoo, I know, yeah)

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Goodbye, away
I'm outta here

// I Will Be There //

If you stick with me, baby, I won't do you wrong
And we're gonna have some fun
We're so good together in this crazy world
Where you can't count on anyone

I'd climb any mountain just to get you free
I would swim the ocean, can you do the same for me?

Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table, got no gas in my tank
With my life we're laying on the line
And I'm saying my prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

(Ooh)
You know that you can lie to me, baby
I will understand
As long as in the end you tell the truth
Ãâ¬~Cause it's give and it's take
It's no piece of cake and I know it works with you

You don't need no doctor
You don't need no pills
You don't need some cozy friends
Running up your bills

(Hey)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table, got no gas in my tank
With my life we're laying on the line
And I'm saying my prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

Bah boom, bah boom, bah boom, bah
Bah boom, bah boom, bah boom, bah

(Hey, hey)
Drop my kind of nectar, jam it to the floor
Where my best clothes out at night
And I'll just give you more

(Oh)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank
With my life we're laying on the line
And I'm saying my prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

(Oh)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank
With my life we're laying on the line
And I'm saying my prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there

(Oh)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank
With my life we're laying on the line
And I'm saying my prayer
I know you're gonna be there, be there
...
