// Sweet Lover Man //

Ooh my sweet sweet sweet lover man
Move me with the touch of your hand
Now, oh baby, now
Stay here inside of me
Show me what love can be
Please, oh baby, please
Fill me with sweet desire
Fill me with love
If I'm with someone else
I'm still alone
Of anyone I've ever know
It's you, it comes back to you
It comes back so tenderly
Watch time you're here with me
Now, oh baby, more 
Moment of ecstasy
Moment of sanity
More, oh baby, more
Fill me with all of you
Fill me with love
And if the pain of living
Grows too much 
As long as you and I can touch
It's real, I know that it's real
I know like I always knew
How good it is with you

// Someday We'll Be Together //

Kept the dream alive
Just why I don't know
You kept me hangin' on
If you really loved me
You'd have let me go
There's no time for regret
'Cause darling I know
Someday we'll be together
Someday, something in the future
You will turn around
See it's nowhere to be found
And you'll come running back
To me
Someday we'll be together
Played your part so well
You really had me fooled 
The big breakdown scene
But think about it now
Oh it was cruel
And it was mean
Oh but when I think of 
When I think of just how it
Could have been
When each love burns out
And it will without a doubt
You'll come running back
Back to me
Yes you will, you'll see

// Take My Heart, Take My Soul //

Hey boy, what you tryin' to do 
Are you tryin' to make me 
Fall in love with you

I said hey boy 
Somethin's goin' on 
Maybe I've been holdin' out 
For far too long

Come and get it 
If my love looks good to you 
Come and get it 
Honey why don't you

Take my heart, take my soul 
Take the wheel, take control 
Take my life, in your hand 
Make my world, wonderland

You've been right here on my mind 
When I look into my heart 
It's you I find yeah 
Baby, you mean everything to me 
'Cause there's nothing else my eyes 
Would rather see

Come and get it 
If my love looks good to you 
Come and get it 
Honey why don't you

Take my heart, take my soul 
Take the wheel, take control 
Take my life, in your hand 
Make my world, wonderland

// Slow Hand //

As the midnight moon, was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see

Darlin' don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night you say it's alright
We got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

I want it all night please say it's alright
It's not a fast move but a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand

I found a lover with a slow hand
A lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush

// We're Gonna Make It //

Got to really get it goin'
That's the only way of knowin'
Make it worth all that we're doin'
We must take it all the way

Followed plans that we perfected
Get results so unexpected
Learn your lessons and accept it
You will find a better way

Trust your heart
Hold onto your dreams and don't let go
Trust your heart

It will never let you down
It will never let you down

We're gonna make it
Yeah we're gonna make it through

Pleasin' yourself is better than pleasin' someone else
It won't be easy for you
It won't be easy for me
Don't stop or you will never know

We're gonna keep on pushin' till it all comes through
Think about what you wanna do
We're gonna make it
Yeah we're gonna make it through

Don't waste your time
You got to get in line
Don't waste your time

No one leaves here without stayin'
In this game of life we're playin'
Got to take a lot of chances
Broken hearts and hot romance

Nothing will be here forever
What is here we can make better
Everything is for a reason
You can do it your way

[repeat chorus]

We're gonna make it

// What A Surprise //

As the midnight moon, was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin' don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves
I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand.

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night
You say it's alright
We got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand.

If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand.

// Got to Find Love //

Down on my luck
Love don't come around much more
Sure seems funny
I've been down the road before
I walk these streets
Lookin' for some kinda sign
All things change in time
I wanna believe

That we have got to find love
Yeah, find love
We have got to find love, find love

If we just hold on
I know the best is yet to come
We've got to hold on
There is a heart for everyone

We have got to find love
Ooh, find love
We have got to find love, find love

The sun just won't shine
I need to see things brighter
Your love could build a fire
And warm my soul
But I ain't givin' up, no, no, no
Though I never was a fighter
Lord, my load could be so much lighter
So much lighter

And we have got to find love
Yeah, find love
We have got to find love, find love

If we just hold on
I know the best is yet to come
We've got to hold on
There is a heart for everyone

We have got to find love
We've got to find love
We have got to find love
We've got to find love

We have got to find love
We've got to find love
(We have got to find love)
We've got to come together
(Find love)
We've got to come together

(We have got to)
Whoo-ooh-ooh, find love
Why won't we find love
We have got to find love
We have got to, we have got to
(Find love)
We have got to find love...

// Fall in Love Again //

We have traveled down this road before
Let's stop and talk it out
What are we fighting for
Words don't always say the pain I feel
How can I prove myself
Boy, can't you see I'm real

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Fall in love again
Don't you wanna fall in love again
Fall in love again, baby, come on
Fall in love again

Ooh...

Loving you is sometimes a mystery
I can't tell when you're there
How do you really feel
And I can't stand to live my life alone
I need you here with me
Don't take my sanity, no

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Don't you want to
Fall in love again
Baby, fall in love
Fall in love again
Come on and fall in love again

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh, yes I do
Come on and fall in love again
Give me one more chance
Fall in love again
Baby, please, I wanna be your woman
Fall in love again
Come on, I'll be good to you

I got to have you, baby
Fall in love again
I got to, I can't help myself
Fall in love again
And when I'm with you
You can't be with no one else
Fall in love again
No, come on, come on, come on
Fall in love again

Fall in love again
Come on, fall in love
Just fall in love with me
Fall in love again
Baby, baby, baby
Fall in love again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, come on
Fall in love again
Yeah, I can't help myself

Fall in love again
Just can't help myself
Fall in love again
Come on, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Fall in love again
Oh, yeah
Fall in love again...

// Should I Do It //

I swore when he hurt me so
I wouldn't see him anymore
But today he called my name
Oh, I could feel the same old flame

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

I know when we're in his car
I couldn't go just so far
I wanna give him everything
So when I hear the telephone ring, yeah

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Oh, I'm so lonely and he's so fine
Maybe I should swallow my pride
Just one, one, one more time, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I really got to know

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
