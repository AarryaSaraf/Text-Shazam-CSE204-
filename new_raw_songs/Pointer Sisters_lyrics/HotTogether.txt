// My Life //

Now's the time
To lay it on the line, boy
You better believe it
You had your chance
To break it down and dance
But you blew it
By trying to tell me how to
Run my life
Look at me
Just sit down and think it over
Can't you see
That I wasn't born yesterday
Working girl
In a world full of confusion
Far too cool
To be taken for a fool
This is my life
And I'm livin' like I'm walkin'
Crazy high life
So you better learn how to play
Doin' that fast life
Got you going 'round in circles
This is my life
And I'm calling all the shots this time
Boys like you
I know the way you do
Waiting something for nothing
All talk, no work
Go ahead and do the jerk
'Cause you blew it
You'll never hold me with your gangster love
Look at me
It should be so elementary
Can't you see
You know that I'm no stranger to the street
Mama said
In a world full of confusion
Take control
You were never born to lose

// Mercury Rising //

Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me

In my mind I'm consumed
And my body wants it just to last
Got one eye full of you
Feel my willpower going fast
Don't stop
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me
What you want I can do
Any questions you got in your head
Let my hands speak the truth
Tell you things I bet you never dreamt
Don't stop me

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, you just turn me on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Keep it up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me come alive
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, you make me feel so right
I know just what you like

There no noise and no phone
Just a rumble coming from this bed
Love your skin on my bones
And my lips to turn to cherry red
Don't stop
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me
Got your paint on my brush
Any picture that you want we'll make
You say, ooh, and I say hush
Keep your fingers dancing on my legs
Don't stop

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, keep my my mind turned on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Let's stay up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me come alive
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, you just drive me wild
I know just what you like

Gonna get you to me tonight
Gonna get you to me
Gonna get you to me tonight
Gonna get you to me

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

No, I can't get enough
Go on and make me holler for more
No, I don't know enough
When to stop asking for more
Make me live for your touch
Come and find it, come and find it

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, you just turn me on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Let's stay up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me burn inside
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, it's the night in me, yeah
I know just what you like
Gonna get you to me tonight...

// Goldmine //

Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine

Flowers arrive, who else whould think of that but my guy
He's all heart and all mine
Ooh and I don't have to be Miss Perfect One
For him to love what he sees
And I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found is every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, what he does just keeps my heart in love, woah
My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, all he does just keeps me here in love
Keeps me right here in love

Five times a day
He calls me up to say
"How you doin' babe"
He's just that way

Leaves me little notes by my coffee cup
The sweetest poetry to me
Ooh and every night he tells me with his touch
The way he moves just makes me want to scream

My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, what he does just keeps my heart in love
Oh woa my baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, all he does just keeps me so in love
Keeps me right here in love, right here in love

His eyes were fire when my heart was cold
My arms were ready for new love to hold
He makes me feel something that I've never known
When you find someone like him, you don't let go

Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine
Gotta love that

Ooh I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found is every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, what he does just keeps my here in love, oh
My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, what he does just keeps me here, keeps me here in love

My baby he's a goldmine
He treats me kind, rain or shine
My baby he's a goldmine
Oh yeah baby, baby, baby bay oh baby
My baby he's a goldmine
Your eyes, your hands, your lips, your nose
Baby your tongue so

// All I Know Is The Way I Feel //

All I know is the way I feel
Anything that makes me feel so good
Just got to be
I can' help myself, it's the way I feel
It's scarin' me to death to think
What you could do to me
You're the one that I've been searching for
You were so hard to find
When you're near I need nothing more
You're so deep inside my heart
My soul and my mind
Lost in space is the way I feel
You got me sailin' way beyond
My wildest dreams
When we're lyin' here soft and warm
All the world is turnin' slow
Nothin' ever came so easy
Wonder just how far, how long
And where it will go
All I know is the way I feel
Nothin' in my life ever was so real
I know I said it a million times
And it always will be true
All I know is the way I feel
All I need to do is to
Keep on lovin' you
All I know is the way I feel
You got me goin' round in circles like
A spinning wheel
I can't help myself, it's got to be
It's scarin' me to death to think
What you could do to me
All I know is the way I feel
Nothin' in my life ever was so real

// Say The Word //

Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Whoo!

I've got my eye on you
Whatever my heart wants comes true
And, baby, I want you
I've got my mind made up
I'm puttin' the finger on you

'Cause I know you really want me
That's not gonna be enough
And it does no good to taunt me
'Cause what you're dreamin'
Is what I'm dreamin' of

Just say the word, yeah!
And open up the door
Just say the word, yeah!
And everything is yours
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love

Say it to me, baby, now

You whet my appetite
It's a crime
Makin' me hungry for more
I gotta have it
This love you get tonight
Is not like anything you had before

'Cause you've got to be my witness
And, boy, you've got to testify
And I'll cover you with kisses
My heart's the truth
And the truth, it never lies

Just say the word, yeah!
We're just one word away
Say the word, yeah!
It's what you wanna say
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
It's what you're dreamin' of

Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Let your heart believe
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love

Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, just say the word, ooh...

Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah

Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word out loud...

// Hot Together //

We could be so hot together, hot together
We could be so hot together, together

We happened to be at the same party
We left it up to chance
I'm remembering the time you kissed me
Now you're asking me to dance
They way we moved with each other
We could dance this dance forever

[Chorus:]
We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good

You led me through the crowded room
And out into the night
You kissed me like you did before
In the quiet of the moonlight
We're wondering if the other's alone
And thinking about taking it home

[Chorus:]
We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good

We could be so hot together, hot together
We could be so hot together, together
The way we moved with each other
We could dance this dance forever

[Chorus:]
We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good

// Sexual Power //

He's the master of persuasion
He's so hot to be so cool
And he shatters my defenses
When he walks into the room
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
I can feel his magnetism
He's seducing me again
I can feel his magnetism
He's seducing me again
He consumes me with emotions
And I'm falling deep with
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
Come to me, I hear him calling
Come to me
Helplessly, I feel myself fallin'
Come to me, come to me
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
He controls the deepest part of me
He fulfills my every fantasy
Overcome by sweet temptation
There's no resisting him
So I release my inhibitions
And surrender once again
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power

// Set Me Free //

It feels so cold, the world is on hold
Everybody's holding back
Too scared to make a connection
Seems as if we've lost the knack' babe
It's been so long since somebody moved me
Made me lose my self-control
I want the pain and the pleasure
Anything to shake my soul

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it the way it's done
I got this need inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Get me a shot of something hot
Oh' somebody set me free
Honey' please set me free

I wanna know the highs and the lows
Tired of living in between
I'll take the heat of the moment
You can keep the old routine, hey
I'm ready for all kinds of emotion
Everything is not too much
I'll buy the risk and the romance
I just wanna feel the rush

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it to someone else
I got this urge inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Give me a shot of something hot
Hey, somebody set me free
Oh' I wanna feel the fire burnin'
Wanna live dangerously
Give me a shot of something hot
Oh, somebody set me free, hey
Honey' please set me free, oh

Give me some chemistry, oh, yeah, yeah
Give me some chemistry, oh, chemistry, yeah

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it the way it's done
I got this need inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Get me a shot of something hot
Ooh, somebody set me free, hey
Hey, I wanna feel the fire burnin'
Wanna live dangerously
Get me a shot of something hot
Hey, somebody set me free
Oh, honey, please set me free, oh...

Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free, oh...
Somebody set me free
(Give me some chemistry)
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free...

My body's hot and my palms are sweaty baby
Don't look surprised when you

Temperature's risin', you know I'm hungry for ya
Just close your eyes and give me

I need a taste, give just a little bit
I've been waiting such a long time for your loving
Don't make me think I'm spending
My time just for nothing
Oh, baby please, give just a taste
Of your love, ooh

// Eyes Don't Lie //

Hot lights on the street
Slow groove I feel the heat
Deep inside a summer night, hypnotized
I saw his face, out in the crowd
I felt no shame starring so loud
Just for a instant and to my surprise
There was a vision of a future in his eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
They say desire is on your mind, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
Only a mirror of what's inside, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
And I know that I can trust
My heart and body and soul
To your eyes

Show me paradise
I've seen what it was like
Heaven knows it's gonna be ecstasy
The way we stared, broke every rule
Our souls were bared, melting love-cool
Instant attraction I was mesmerized
Held by the promise of pleasure in his eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
They say desire is on your mind, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
Only a mirror of what's inside, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
And I know that I can trust
My heart and body

They read me, they groove me
Have power to move me, I know, yeah
The magic, the wonder
The spell that I'm under in your
With your eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Desire is hard to hide, but, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
No sense in even trying, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
You can't hide of what you feel inside
No, no, no, baby
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Your eyes set me on fire, baby
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Ooh, you got me mesmerized
With your eyes
