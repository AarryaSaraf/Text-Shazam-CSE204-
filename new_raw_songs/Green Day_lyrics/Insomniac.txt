Album: Insomniac

// Armatage Shanks //

Fffff

Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
I'm branded, maladjusted
Never trusted anyone, let alone myself

I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
No meaning and no healing
Self-loathing freak, an introverted deviant

I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Say whatever, oh-oh, whoa-oh
Say whatever, oh-oh, whoa-oh
Shoot!

Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

I must insist on being the pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
I'm gettin' pissed, I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind

// Brat //

Mom and dad don't look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And get my inheritance

Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

Crow's feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parents' income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I'm a snot-nosed slob without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
But my future's looking good

Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
That nothing good can last

Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
That nothing good can last

// Stuck With Me //

I'm not part of your elite, I'm just alright
Class structures waving, colors bleeding from my throat
Not subservient to you, I'm just alright
Down-classed by the powers that be, give me loss of hope

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

What's my price, and will you pay it if it's alright?
Take it from my dignity and waste it 'til it's dead
Throw me back into the gutter 'cause it's alright
Find another pleasure-fucker, drag them down to hell

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

One, two, three, four!

Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

// Geek Stink Breath //

I'm on a mission, I've made my decision
Lead a path of self-destruction
A slow progression, killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth

I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face

Every hour, my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin, white line

I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!

I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
A wish in one hand, shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first

I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well I don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!

Geek! Stink! Breath!

// No Pride //

Well, I'm just a mutt
And nowhere is my home
Where dignity's a land mine
In the school of lost hope
I've panhandled for a life because
I'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost and founds
Of second hand regret

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

Well, sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No culture's worth a stream of piss
Or a bullet in my face
To hell with unity
Separation'll kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed
Before the final fall

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one
I got no pride

You better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You better digest your values
Because they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
I know I'm not the one

I got no pride
I got no pride
Close your eyes and die
I got no pride

// Bab's Uvula Who? //

I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies, and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short, and my blood pressure is high
I lose control, and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts, and I fly off the wall
I self-destruct, and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
I hate myself, and I'm all wound up
Loss of control, and I'm all wound up
I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!

Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut, and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure, it'll never come back
Loss of control, and I get myself all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps, and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion, panic attack
I slipped a gear, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Well I'm afraid now that I'm all wound up
I hate myself, and I'm all wound up
I like myself, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!

I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies, and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short, and my blood pressure is high
I lose control, and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts, and I fly off the wall
I'm on the run, and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Loss of control, and I'm all wound up
Panic attack, and I'm all wound up
Well I got fed up, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!

// 86 //

What brings you around?
Did you lose something the last time you were here?
You'll never find it now
It's buried deep with your identity

So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try

Exit out the back
And never show your head around again
Purchase your ticket
And quickly take the last train out of town

And stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try

There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
Don't even try

// Panic Song //

Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self-destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of anguish
Mass confusion

Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with "I don't care"

There's a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing's left
Torn out of reality
To a state of no opinion
Limp with hate

Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with "I don't care"

I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out

// Stuart And The Ave //

Standing on the corner of Stuart and the avenue
Ripping up my transfer and a photograph of you
You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existence
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before, it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Seasons change as well as minds, and I'm a two-faced clown
You're Mommy's little nightmare, driving Daddy's car around
I'm beat down and half brain dead, the long lost king of fools
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid enough to stay with you

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before, it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before, it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up
We're all fucked up
You're all fucked up

// Brain Stew //

I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
Still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Past the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

// Jaded //

Somebody keep my balance, I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways, leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5, hooray, we're gonna die
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere, in nowhere

// Westbound Sign //

Boxed up all of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and a westbound sign
Weighed out her choices on a scale
Prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a blank decision

She's taking off
Taking off
Taking off
Taking off

No time and no copping out
She's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rear-view mirror heading westward on
Strung out on a confusion road
And ten-minute nervous breakdowns
Xanax, a beer for thought, and she's determined

She's taking off
Taking off
Taking off
Taking off

Oh, is this salvation?
Or an escape from discontent?
Will she find her name
In the California cement?
Punched out of the grind
That punched her one too many times
Is tragedy 2000 miles away?
She's taking off

Alright!

// Tight Wad Hill //

Cheapskate on the hill
A thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs
One more night

Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn... Tight Wad Hill

Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie
But having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existence

Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn... Tight Wad Hill

Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn... Tight Wad Hill

// Walking Contradiction //

Do as I say, not as I do
Because the shit's so deep, you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
Agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I'll hit you again
A smart ass, but I'm playing dumb

Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind the gun
Call it as I see it, even if
I was born deaf, blind, and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
A victim of a catch-22

I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

Do as I say, not as I do
Because the shit's so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
Agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I'll hit you again
A smart ass, but I'm playing dumb

I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

Ay!
