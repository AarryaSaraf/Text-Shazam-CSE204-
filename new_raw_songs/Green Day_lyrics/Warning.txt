Album: Warning

// Warning //

This is a public service announcement, this is only a test
Emergency evacuation protest
May impair your ability to operate machinery
Can't quite tell just what it means to me
Keep out of reach of children, don't you talk to strangers
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker

Warning: Live without warning
I said, "Warning: Live without warning"
Without, alright

Better homes and safety-sealed communities
Did you remember to pay the utility?
Caution: Police line, you better not cross
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything
Or shut up and be a victim of authority

Warning: Live without warning!
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"
Without, alright

Better homes and safety-sealed communities
Did you remember to pay the utility?
Caution: Police line, you better not cross
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?
Sanitation, expiration date, question everything
Or shut up and be a victim of authority

Warning: Live without warning!
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"
I said, "Warning: Live without warning!"

This is a public service announcement, this is only a test

// Blood, Sex And Booze //

Head down! Head down! Head down!
Do you understand me?!
Aw shit!

Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair
It's so unfair
I don't dare to move
For the pain she puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed

I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"

My head is in the gutter
Thank you, sir, strike up another
Mandolin of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down to the wood
It feels so good

I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"

I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex and booze you give me

I'll show you a real time!

// Church On Sunday //

Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend everything's alright, now
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older
I'm not gonna say that yesterday never was

Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise

I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
And nothing but that truth is what I'll ever hear from you, now
"Trust" is a dirty word that comes from such a liar
But respect is something I will earn if you have faith

Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise

Let's go!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
And this compromise
Yes, I'll compromise

// Fashion Victim //

[Billie Joe Armstrong:]
He's a victim of his own time
In his vintage suit and tie
He's a casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And to follow your dress codes
What's in a name? Hey!

She's a scented magazine
Looking sharp and living clean
Living well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me
When you're dancing through your wardrobe
Do the anorex-a-go-go
Cloaked with style for pedophiles
As your credit card explodes

Well, you auction off your life
For the most expensive price
Going once, going twice, it's gone

Alright, hey!

[Benmont Tench:]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

[Billie Joe Armstrong & Benmont Tench:]
Well, you auction off your life (Going once)
For the most expensive price (Twice, it's gone)
Going once, going twice, it's gone

[Billie Joe Armstrong:]
Alright, hey!

What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name?

// Castaway //

Cha!

I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway

I'm riding on the night train and driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion on the corners of my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway

I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in the lurch and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway

Castaway
Castaway (Castaway)
Castaway (Castaway)

// Misery //

Virginia was a lot-lizard from FLA
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery
Mr. Whirly had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhandling misery

And he's gonna get high, high, high
When he's low, low, low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams, "Why, oh, why?"
I said, "I don't know"
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

The Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in Tinseltown
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat
In the name of misery
Then Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally

And they're gonna get high, high, high
When they're low, low, low
The fire burns from better days
And she screamed, "Why, oh, why?"
I said, "I don't know"
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

Well, hell hounds on your trail now once again, boy
It's groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
'Cause it's not what you make, it's what you leave

And we're gonna get high, high, high
When we're low, low, low
The fire burns for better days
And she screams, "Why, oh, why?"
I said, "I don't know"
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

// Deadbeat Holiday //

Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone
"Icon" is the last chance for hope
When there's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find
That you're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Holiday!
Suicide!

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When all you wanna do
Not to give up! (Give up!)

Deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Holiday!

// Hold On //

As I step to the edge on the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum that hammers on and on
'Til I reach the break of day
When the sun beats down on the halfway house
Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear, the will to persevere
As I reach the break of day

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
Got to hold on, hold on to yourself

A cry of hope, a plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It's not what I want, for it's all that I need
To reach the break of day
So I run to the edge on the shadow of a doubt
With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth, the lost treasures of my youth
As I hold to the break of day

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
Gotta hold on, hold on to yourself

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
Gotta hold on, gotta hold on
Hold on, hold on to yourself

// Jackass //

Alright!

To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
Well, I don't mind if you don't mind
Well, I am not the one that's gonna die
I guess I just can't listen
To this one-sided conversation again
'Cause I don't care if I don't care
Well, no one ever said that life is fair

Well, everybody loves a joke, but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse, and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

The center of attention
Got an honorable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
You're a figment of your own imagination

Well, everybody loves a joke, but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse, and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
Well, I don't mind if you don't mind
You're wasting all your time

// Waiting //

I've been waiting a long time
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Downtown, lights will be shining
On me like a new diamond
Ring out under the midnight hour
Well, no one can touch me now, well
And I can't turn my back, it's
Too late, ready or not at all

Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!

Dawning of a new era
Calling, don't let it catch ya
Falling, ready or not at all
Oh, so close enough to taste it
Almost, I can embrace this
Feeling on the tip of my tongue

Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!

You better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!

Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!

You better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!

I've been waiting a lifetime
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck, color me stupid
Good luck, you're gonna need it
Where I'm going, if I get there at all
Wake up! You better thank your lucky stars!

// Minority //

I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog, there of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd unsung against the mold
Without a doubt, singled out, the only way I know

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat, now
The only way I know

One light, one mind flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority (Hey!)

One light, one mind, flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority

// Macy's Day Parade //

Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With a credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh-oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
Lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted

What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout the only road
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
