// Nuclear Family //

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel that keeps breaking down
Drinking angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action, so gimme my turn

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill
Ba-baby, baby it's a blow out, oh yeah
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel that keeps breaking down
Scream, screaming, screaming bloody murder
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too

I say ten! (Whoa-oh) Nine! (Whoa-oh)
Eight! (Whoa-oh) Seven! (Whoa-oh)
Six! (Whoa-oh) Five! (Whoa-oh)
Four! (Whoa-oh) Three! (Whoa-oh)
Five, four, three, two, one!

// Stay The Night //

Well, I ain't got much time, so I'll get to the point
Do you wanna share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint?
I've got an impulse so repulsive that it burns
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach churn

I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

Say you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye
Say you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye

Well, you're so sick and tired of feeling so alone
Well, I don't understand the point if you have to go home
So won't you stay and count the circles 'round my eyes?
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise

I got to know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

Say, you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye
Say, you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye

Tonight
I got to know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

Say, you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye
Say, you'll stay the night, because we're running out of time
So stay the night, I don't wanna say goodbye

// Carpe Diem //

Breaking in a sweat like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out?
Nothing left to lose, detonate the fuse
Another breaking news blowout
Ain't it beautiful? So unusual
Life's a gas and it's running out
Living a cliche, gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets that celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

A blink of an eye, barely scraping by
Dominated by passersby
Feeling out of luck when the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind
Getting off a binge, get a second wind
Another promise to make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range
Ain't it strange? Ain't it strange?

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving, alright?

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?
Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Are we all too young to die?
Ask a reason, and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

// Let Yourself Go //

Shut your mouth, 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain

It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth, 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!

Cut the crap, 'cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face

You're getting on my utter last nerve
Everything you said, I've already heard
I'm sick to death of your every last breath
(Shut the fuck up!)
And I don't give a fuck anyway

Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!

Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fuck, fucking with my head now
Always fucking with my head and I gotta

Let it go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

// Kill The DJ //

Wow! Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy in the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldiers filled with jive and mind-control

The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death unless youâ

Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"

We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Ooh, beer goggles left in the club, a pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah in the century of thrills

The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death unless youâ

Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Hold him underwater 'til that motherfucker drowns

We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Someone's gonna get you, boy
Shoot that fucker down!

Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ
Shoot that fucker down, wow!

Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"

// Fell For You //

I woke up in a pool of sweat
At first, I thought that I pissed the bed
All the stars in the midnight hour
A kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower

And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight, but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you

I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination too?

Break a leg and you crushed my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings, going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive

And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight, but not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you

I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, crash into you
Did you crash in my imagination?

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you

And I fell for you
And I fell for you, oh-oh

// Loss Of Control //

Wow!

I'm takin' down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit-talkin' drama queens, and they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral than into this high school reunion

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But now you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control

Hangin' out all by myself, at least I'm in good company
Hey, isn't that ol' what's-his-face that I see walking down the street?
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common, and I never liked you anyway

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But when you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker serving shit to the pigs

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But now you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control

// Troublemaker //

Yeah! Woo-ooh-ooh!

Hey! You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest when I'm sitting at the traffic light
Hey! I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium delirium on the lower east side of your mind

Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker

Hey! I like your BMW
I like your BM-excellent tits with a tattoo of a pig sniffin' glue
Hey! You're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell, sunburned in a pink bathing suit

Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker

Hey!
Woo-ooh-ooh!
Woo-ooh-ooh!
Woo-ooh-ooh!
Yeah!

Easy come and go, gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron
I wouldn't say I'm straight, 'cause I'm bent out of shape
From now 'til death do we party, just before it's too late

Hey! Aww, you're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest when I'm sitting at the traffic light
Hey! Woo-ooh-ooh!
Hey! Woo-ooh-ooh!
Hey! Woo-ooh-ooh!
Hey! Woo-ooh-ooh!

// Angel Blue //

Gotta build it up just to burn it down
You're the princess, I'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses, 'cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid, and no one ever gives you a break
You want a seÃ±orita, and now your heart is gonna break

You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
As my tears are putting out my cigarette

We'll hit the cemetery so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everything'll be alright

You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces

Alright, stuck in the middle of heaven and hell
Alright, trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses, 'cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid, and no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita, and now it's on you're gonna break

You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces

// Sweet 16 //

Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown-eyed girl
That's throwing down a bottle of Olde English
Back in the warehouse

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16

Asleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab out my heart like a dartboard
Brown-skinned girl
That I dream about a long, long time, now
From the Midwest to the beach

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16

Say wha?

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16

// Rusty James //

This whiskey's sour, amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
Someday, we will fight again, well
Your enemies, your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at?

And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound, alright!

This broken scene is turning green
And brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living
I wanna ride on the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang, man?

And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound

So long
You didn't even say a goodnight
So long
There's nowhere to go when you're hiding in plain sight!

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound

// Oh Love //

Oh love, oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh life, oh life
Please don't pass me by
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop when the red lights flash
Oh ride, free ride
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away, waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away, waste away tonight
Tonight, my heart's on the loose (Yeah)

Oh lights and action
I just can't be satisfied
Oh losers and choosers
Won't you please hold on to my life?
Oh hours, and hours
Like the dog years of the day
Old story, same old story
Won't you see the light of day?

Far away, far away, waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away, waste away tonight
Tonight, my heart's on the loose

Talk myself out of feeling
Talk my way out of control
Talk myself out of falling in love
Falling in love with you, say!

Oh love, oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh ride, free ride
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away, waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away, waste away tonight
Tonight, my heart's on the loose
Far away, far away, waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away, far away, waste away tonight
Tonight, my heart's on the loose
Tonight, my heart's on the loose
Tonight, my heart's on the loose
