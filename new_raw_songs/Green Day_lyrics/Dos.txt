// See You Tonight //

Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight

Wherever the night takes you
Maybe you'll see me too

The colder it gets, you won't see me anymore
But there's still a chance I might walk to your door

Maybe the time is not right
I won't be seeing you tonight

Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight

// Fuck Time //

Oh, drop your laundry and slam the door
I want your love, so give me more
I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime
Ahhhh

Oh baby baby
It's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed, WHOA

Oh Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I want to choke you 'til you're blue in the face
Got dirty thoughts and a dirty mind
Ahhhh

Oh baby baby
It's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Ahhhh, ahh, ha-ha-ha, yeah, WHOA

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

// Stop When The Red Light Flash //

Uncomfortable silence
I'll kill it if you want me to
I'm like ultra-violence
I'll kill it if you want me to
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind

I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender

Stop when the red lights flash
I'll trade you blood for dirty cash

Life in the catacombs
You make me feel like I'm at home
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind

I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender

Out of sight, out of mind
Just give in one more time

I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender

// Lazy Bones //

I'm too tired to be bored
I'm too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening
It's like picking at a sore

I'm too mental to go crazy
I'm too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me
And I can't sleep tonight

'Cause I'm so tired
I can't take it anymore
Out with all the liars
Like a prisoner of war

I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear it anymore

It's good to see you
But I really must admit
There's an odor in the air
And I think you look like shit

I can't stand from falling down
I'm too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking
And they can't shut the fuck up

'Cause I'm so tired
I can't take it anymore
With all the liars
Like a prisoner of war

I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear it anymore

I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your honesty
I just want to get some peace of mind
It's only in my head
As I roll over and play dead
I don't want to hear about it
I don't want to scream about it
I don't want to hear it anymore

// Wild One //

She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in panic, her eyes look so manic, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
My heart is a chaser, she's strung out on razors, now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in danger, from shadows and strangers, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
She's covered in angels and demons and halos, now

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

Wild one
Wild one

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

Little wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in danger, she's strung out on razors now
My heart is in danger, she's strung out on razors now

// Makeout Party //

Hey, you got yourself a pretty little mouth
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way
Do you wanna spin the bottle, play a game of chicken?
Well, it's a tongue twister 'til your lips are bleeding

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intention

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intention

Oh, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Oh kiss me there
Kiss me there

// Stray Heart //

I lost my way
Oh baby this stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover baby?
Oh you're the only one that I'm dreamin' of
Your precious heart
Was torn apart by me and you

You're not alone
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

I said a thousand times
And now a thousand one
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart

We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you
You're not alone
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

You're not alone
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just can't have you

Everything that I want
I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need
I need from you
But I just
Just can't have you

// Ashley //

Ashley
Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?

Ashley
Are you bumming around?
Yeah, you're crying on my cold shoulder

You used to dangle my heart with your puppet strings
You dangled your desires right in front of my face
You led me to the well but wouldn't let me drink
Swallowing my pride and never even got the taste

But time comes around and I'm not so naive
I finally lost touch 'cause you're so out of reach
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint

Ashley
Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?

Ashley
Are you bumming around?
Yeah, you're crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley
Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?

Ashley
Are you bumming around?
Yeah, you're crying on my cold shoulder

You are where you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought in my memory

I taste the cigarettes and liquor on your breath
We used to call it speed but now it's crystal meth
Back when I loved you but you're scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less

But time comes around and I'm not so naive
I finally lost touch 'cause you're so out of reach
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint

Ashley
Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?

Ashley
Are you bumming around?
Yeah, you're crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley
Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?

Ashley
Are you bumming around?
Yeah, you're crying on my cold shoulder

// Baby Eyes //

Go! Go! Go!

Year of the rat, last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter
They say my middle name is "Danger"
The kind you keep away from strangers

I say whoa, I'm out of control
Well, baby, when I see your pretty face
I say whoa, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby I was born to kill

I pulled the trigger for the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car
I am the cherub in the Arab spring
I am the bullet in your magazine

I say whoa, I'm out of control
Well, baby, when I see your pretty face
I say whoa, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby eyes

Well, baby, baby eyes
Well, baby, baby I was born to... Kill!

// Lady Cobra //

Well, I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes

Well, she just wants to get me high (she don't want)
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell, lost in temptation (she don't need)
Rubbing on my inner demons

I don't wanna suicide
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight

Do you wanna play a game of Twister (she don't)
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter?

I don't wanna suicide
I don't want this to end
Well, I just wanna be your friend

Well, I don't want to make you cry (she don't want)
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawing blood and lonely stars (she don't need)
Drinking piss for cheap guitars

I don't wanna a suicide
I don't want this to end
I just wanna be your friend

Oh, your friend

// Nightlife //

[Billie Joe Armstrong:]
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife

[Lady Cobra:]
What's that I hear? You want to go for a ride?
Oh, don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got that thing that you want, the fix that you need
And have this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying, "Hey, boy, come over"
For my black heart beats crimson and clover
So operator, operator, patch my boy in
This is nightlife, and I'll get under your skin

[Billie Joe Armstrong:]
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife

[Lady Cobra:]
Short of breath, heartbeat fast
Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet halls line these sugar-coated walls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes, mistakes, and whiskey shakes
It's too late, I already cut the brakes

[Billie Joe Armstrong & Lady Cobra:]
Well, I am rolling, strolling into town (Come inside)
Is it me, or am I going crazy? (It's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (Sugar town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife

[Lady Cobra:]
Come inside
It's just you
Sugar town

Gonna make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl coco dancing the cooch
One hand on my knee, one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round?
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
'Cause I'm a ringleader, I run the show
And only when I tell ya it will be time to go

[Billie Joe Armstrong:]
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife

[Billie Joe Armstrong & Lady Cobra:]
(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey, boy) She is my nightlife
(See you later) She is my nightlife

// Wow! That's Loud //

Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes

Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal, nuclear and so delightful
Wearing Day-Glo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes

Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes

// Amy //

Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame

Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harm's way?
Warding off all evil signs
But never really kept you safe
Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
Twenty-seven, gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink

Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of

Amy, please don't go
Amy, please don't go

Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance, if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby
So we can sing you to sleep?

Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
