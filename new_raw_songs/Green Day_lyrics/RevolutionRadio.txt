// Somewhere Now //

I'm running late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so dull?

(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes

I got a seat in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can vote
At the speed of life
I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shooting star
There's a soldier that's freaking out
P.S. This is war

(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Here comes nothing, there's nothing to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!

(Ooh) Hallelujah, I found my soul
(Ooh) Under the sofa pillows
(Ooh) Congratulations, I found myself
(One, two!) Somewhere now
Somewhere now, somewhere now

// Bang Bang //

This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution. The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions. Described as severely mentally disturbed. It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group. Deserve to be annihilated.

I get my kicks and I want to start a rager
I want to dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for violent behavior
I'm sweating bullets like a modern Romeo

Bang Bang! Give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio
I got my photo bomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

Bang Bang! Give me fame
Shoot me up to entertain
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed
Give me death or give me head
Broadcasting from my room and playing with my toys

I want to be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang bang), hurrah (bang bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

I want to be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private ho (ho) ly (war)
Oh baby baby this is Viva Vendetta
For this is love or it's (World War Zero)

I want to be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang bang), hurrah (bang bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

I want to be a celebrity martyr
The leading man in my own private drama
Hurrah (bang bang), hurrah (bang bang)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

// Revolution Radio //

Scream! With your hands up in the sky
Like you wanna testify
For the life that's been deleted
Scream! Like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated

We will be seen, but not be heard

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

(Gimme) Rage! Like there's tear gas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise! Of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves
For the anti-social media

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

We will be seen, but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

// Say Goodbye //

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Goodbye to the ones that we love

Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering (the suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we

(Roll... Roll...)

Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the ones in control

Teach your children well
From the bottom of the well
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering (the suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we

(Roll... Roll... Roll...)

Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
Oh Lord have mercy on my soul
Kindred Spirits sing
For the sick and suffering (the suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we

Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say a prayer for the ones we love
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

(This is how we)

Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say a prayer for the ones we love
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love

(This is how we)

// Outlaws //

Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a fading memory

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

Scars, broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our life beyond the stars

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

I got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirit's place to roam
I plead my innocence
I plead my innocence
But that's my best defense
When you are young

Outlaws
When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now you'll roam

// Bouncing Off The Wall //

Concrete dream (Hey!)
I'm gonna make a scene
The radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

Bombs away (Hey!)
It's just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn't sweat it
Everybody's bouncing off the walls

I'm bouncing off the walls

Alright

Concrete kiss (Hey!)
Come on and do the twist
The radio
My little exorcist
We're all getting pissed
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

I'm bouncing off the walls

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

// Still Breathing //

I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you

I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away, away...

As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way, away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away
'Cause I'm still breathing (My way to you)
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own (My way to you)
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away
My way to you

// Youngblood //

Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch drunk and youngblood

She's a loner, not a stoner
Bleeding heart and the soul of Ms. Teresa
Supernova, Cherry Cola
She's the cedar in the trees of Minnesota

I'm a rough boy around the edges
Getting drunk and falling into hedges
She's my weakness, fucking genius
Swear to God and I'm not even superstitious

Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch drunk and youngblood

I wanna hold you like a gun
We'll shoot the moon into the sun (daylight)
Alright (alright)
Alright

Are you stranded, like I'm stranded?
Do you wanna watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken, like I'm broken?
Are you restless? She said: "Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!"

Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Youngblood
Punch drunk and youngblood

// Too Dumb To Die //

Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Going off on the weekends
Smoking dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends
Me and my friends sang
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Here's to the middle of the road
At least it's better than here"

Looking for a buzz
But all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that everything will be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter
The picket line screamed
"Woah-uh-oh-oh-oh (woah-uh-oh)
Don't cross, don't cross the line
Because you'll be a scab, not a martyr"

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to... (haha, yeah, hey!)

Looking for a cause
But all I got was Camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high, too scared to dream
But too dumb to die

// Troubled Times //

What good is love and peace on earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

What part of history we learn
When it's repeated
Some things will never overcome
If we don't seek it
The world stops turning
Paradise burning
So don't think twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

We run for cover
Like a skyscraper's falling down
Then I wonder like a troubled mind

What good is love and peace on earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't look twice

We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times

// Forever Now //

[Part 1: "I'm Freaking Out"]

My name is Billie and I'm freaking out
I thought therefore I was well I can't really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories as if I was never there

Standing at the edge of the world
It's giving me the chills
But looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!

I'm like a punk rocker on Labor Day
How the hell did I work so hard to be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well (freaking out)
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell

Standing at the edge of the world
It's giving me the chills
But looking down the edge of the world
Lost in a tango, it's freaking me out
Burning lights and blackouts

(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!

[Part 2: "A Better Way To Die"]

If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life
I want a better way to die

Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up
I want a better way to die

[Part 3: "Somewhere Now (Reprise)"]

I'm running late to somewhere now that I don't want to be
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side ever get so full?

Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere

Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about it, oh
It doesn't matter anyway

(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh I
I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day

// Ordinary World //

Where can I find the city of shining light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?

The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world?
I'd walk to the end of the earth and afar
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Where can I find the city of shining light?
In an ordinary world
How can I leave a buried treasure behind?
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
