// Brutal Love //

Turn out the lights
Close your eyes
Turn up the silence
The heartache of your life
Dance forever
Under the lights
This brutal love

Oh how you want it
You're begging for it
But you can't have it
Even if you try
It's in the clutches
In the hands of
This brutal love

Old toys
This plastic heart
Loners and fools
Are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love

Danger
Not quite at home
The eyes of temptation
The flesh on my bones
Hello stranger
I'm a disaster
This brutal love

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad sex
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled mind

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool
Bad love
Kiss me I'm loaded
Something for my troubled mind

Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out
Drop dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
This brutal love

// Missing You //

Waking up, feeling naked
In my clothes, inside a room that's vacant
Lost my nerve, and it's un-nerving
I know there is something I'm forgetting

Oh, I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement, looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Remember, was the first time (First time)
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Don't forget, 'cause it's not over (Over)
I'm not lost, 'cause I'm just missing you

I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement, looking

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you... Say hey!

Well she's my blood, well she's my soul
I get so lost out in the cold
Feels so far, like this lone star
It gets so hard when I'm missing you

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around
And I'm a fucking disaster
I'm missing you

// 8th Avenue Serenade //

Say "hello" from your window
Say "goodbye" from your car
Say "goodnight" from your pillow
Say "so long" from the stars

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Take a walk out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs for a mid-life
Don't forget to pass me by

As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

// Drama Queen //

She is my drama queen
She is so wet and reckless
She is my drama queen
She dangles from her necklace

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

She is my drama queen
Her life is now unfolding
There goes my drama queen
What do you think she's holding?

Hey, little drama queen
Or did you find your savior?
Oh little drama queen
You better call a lawyer

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

Hey, little drama queen
From New York to San Francisco?
Everyone's drama queen
I think she's going psycho

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
Everyone's drama queen
Is old enough to bleed now

She's old enough to bleed now
She's old enough to bleed now

// X-Kid //

Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your own glory, even now it's gone

I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
And then I crashed into a wall
And then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out again

I once was old enough to know better
Then I was too young to care, but who cares?
I probably would, but Hollywood is dead and gone

You fell in love, but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head, you're an X-Kid
And you never even got started again

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out

And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart

Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
You're an X-kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out, over and over and out

// Sex, Drugs & Violence //

All my life, trouble follows me like a mystery girl
I've been chasing round a memory like a mystery girl
I've been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up, and it's freaking me out

Back at school, it never made much sense
And now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes, I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger

Well, I don't wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way

All my life I've been running wild like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me, like a stowaway

Back at home, it never made much sense
Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes, I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger, hey!

Back at home, it never made much sense
And I can pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, I guess, but that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to

Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Sex, drugs, and violence
English, math, and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger

// Little Boy Named Train //

Where did you come from? Where have you been?
It looks like you fell into the trash bin
I caught the train, I'm crashing the car
Packing for daylight, shooting for the stars

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination

'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
A little boy named Train
I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been... Ay!

Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious
I'm always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions, and I'll get lost again

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination

'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
A little boy named Train
I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been... Say!

Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination

'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
A little boy named Train
I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been
I said I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been

// Amanda //

Amanda, don't you know
That I still walk around
This foggy roundabout
When I get back in town?
I was a different man
From five seconds ago
And you're a different woman, that's for certain
And I don't know a thing about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man

Amanda, don't you know
I wasn't strong enough?
And in your wild mind
I wasn't smart enough
I was a different kid
From fifteen years ago
And you're a different woman, that's for certain
And I wanna know about

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man

I'm not playing with your mind
Unless you think I am
'Cause you're crushing my heart
Like a battering-ram

Is this some kind of love
That only hate would understand?
Amanda, I couldn't be your man

// Walk Away //

This time
I've gotta put my guard down
And pick myself up off the ground
And take the pain
It'll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains remind me
That I'm still living

Well, it's not too late
Oh, it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, it's time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away

Did you win?
Or maybe did you lose?
Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway
It goes back to you
When you fall
You're gonna need a parachute
Or a used pair of shoes to go
And walk away

Well, it's not too late
Oh, it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, it's time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away

Walk away
Ay, ay-ay-ay, ay, walk away
Ay, ay-ay-ay, ay, walk away

Well, the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Walk away
Walk away

// Dirty Rotten Bastards //

[Part I]

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery
Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects, and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers, ra da-da da-dee!
The bottom-feeders' frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers, sing along with me
'Cause we don't say "no," scream one, two, three!

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Hey!

[Part II]

We're too old to be misbehaved
We sold our souls, and so ashamed of ourselves
So we wait for Miss Judgment Day
Write me a letter,and send it to my grave, yeah

[Part III]

All fucked up, beyond intervention
Fuck the world, this is my revolution!
Long lost souls and living in cages
I'm on a bender, it's one for the ages

I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well, Juliana Homicide
Oh, won't you be my blushing bride?

I chopped me a line of my best friend's ashes
Dust to dust when the red light flashes
What the fuck does "ok" stand for?
When the afterlife is only worth dying for

I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well, Juliana Homicide
Oh, won't you be my blushing bride? Alright!

Well, California's burning to the ground
And Juliana walks on holy ground
Where there's smoke, there's fire burning out the lights
'Cause California's burning down tonight, tonight

[Part IV]

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery
Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers, ra da-da da-dee!
The bottom-feeders' frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers, sing along with me
'Cause we don't say "no," scream one, two, three!

[Part V]

We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away

// 99 Revolutions //

There's a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A "going out of business" sale
And a race to bankruptcy
It's not one to ninety-nine, it's ninety-nine to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

There's a rat in the company
A bailout on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff (Whoa-oh)
Become so obsolete?
Hit the lights and bang the drum
And let your flag unfold
'Cause history will prove itself
In the halls of justice and lost souls

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I'm ninety-nine percent sure
That something's wrong
It's all wrong!

It's ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight
Ninety-nine revolutions tonight

Nine! Nine! To one! To one!

// The Forgotten //

Where in the world's the forgotten?
They're lost inside your memory
You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history
Where in the world did the time go?
It's where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream
Well, don't look away, sometimes, you're better lost than to be seen

I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I can't quite put my finger on it
But it's like a child that was left behind
So where in the world's the forgotten?
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away, sometimes, you're better lost than to be seen

Well, don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
Well, don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of love

Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away; sometimes, you're better lost than to be seen

Well, don't look away from the arms of a moment
Well, don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
Well, don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of love
