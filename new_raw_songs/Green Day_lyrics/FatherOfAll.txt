Album: FatherOfAll

// Father Of All Motherfuckers //

I woke up to a message of love
Choking up on the smoke from above
I'm obsessed with the poison and us
What a mess? Cause there's no one to trust

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us
I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
Crackin' up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us

I'm impressed with the presence of none
I'm possessed by the heat of the sun
Hurry up cause I'm making a fuss
Fingers up
Cause there's no one to trust

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us
I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
Crackin' up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us

Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lying in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Oh, yeah

Feed the creeps with a stick and bone

// Oh Yeah! //

Oh (Yeah)
'Kay, I got it

I'm in the crowd full of angels and demons
I'm looking out for the jingoes and heathens
Nobody move and nobody gonna get hurt
Reach for the sky with your face in the dirt (Yeah)

Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)

I got blood on my hands in my pockets
That's what you get turning bullets into rockets (Rockâ)
I am a kid of a bad education
The shooting star of a lowered expectation

Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)

I'm just a face in the crowd of spectators
To the sound of the voice of a traitor
Dirty looks and I'm looking for a payback
Burning books in a bulletproof backpack

Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Everybody is a star)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (Everybody is a star, ow)

// Meet Me On The Roof //

I'm crawling on the dance floor (Dance floor)
I think I lost my phone
Feeling like a toothache (Toothache)
My face is going numb
I beg a thousand pardons
All my friends are crazy
Hanging from the window (Window)
And all you gotta do is jump

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?

I'm hanging with the cholos (Cholo)
Cruising down the strip
Sleeping with a pillow (Don't wake me up don't wake me up)
Waking up in spit
I'm taking drowning lessons
Secret words and true
Confessionals (Confessionals)
And the worst is yet to come

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?

So meet me where the good times go, ooh
How high is your low? As far as I can go

Come meet me on the roof tonight girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go girl?

// I Was A Teenage Teenager //

I don't want to freak you out but I cannot lie
I don't want to freak you out but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? Who's holding the drugs?
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie

I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I am an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers

I don't want to freak you out but I cannot lie
I don't want to freak you out but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? Who's holding the drugs?
I don't want to freak you out, but I cannot lie

I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I am an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers

I was a teenage teenager full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager, I am an alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers

// Stab You In The Heart //

Baby infidel in a dirty magazine
Telling dirty lies, everybody can see
Kick it in the head and now I wanna see you dead
With a switchblade edge to the chest

I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
And you know it ain't right

Pictures don't lie when you're front-page news
Dagger to the heart coming down on you

I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
Girl, you know it ain't right

Daggers in my eyes and a rusty tambourine
Gimme my stiletto, gonna do some surgery

Right to the heart (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
I wanna stab you in the heart (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
And you know it ain't right

// Sugar Youth //

What are the symptoms of our happiness and Civil War?
Mano y mano in the stereo without a cure
I've got a fever a non-believer and it's killing me
Like a high school loser that will never ever ever ever fuck the prom queen

I got the shakes and I'm on fire
I got a feeling and it's dangerous
I'm gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and heaven only knows
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo, no

I'm hearing voices up inside my head
(Oh what you thinkin'?)
I need a sugar fix it's making me sick
(Oh what you drinkin'?)
I wanna drink all the poison in the water
I wanna choke like a dog that's on a collar
I am the child of coyote and bandito
I'm drinking whiskey by the river doing yeyo!

I got the shakes and I'm on fire
I got a feeling and it's dangerous
I'm gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and heaven only knows
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo, no

// Junkies On A High //

My mama said to me
"You're gonna have your enemies
Don't beg, don't follow"
I've heard it all before
I smashed my fingers in the door
My downward spiral, oh yeah

Rock 'n' roll tragedy
I think the next one could be me
Heaven's my rival
I sing in revelry
I got my own conspiracies
What hides in shadows? Oh yeah

Junkies on a high
Get back, lay down, go low
Subdivision smile
Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up
As we watch the world burn
As we watch the world burn

I'm not a soldier
This ain't no new world order
My path, don't follow
My name is "Nobody"
My pride is my pornography
Kool-Aid's my motto, "Oh yeah!"

Junkies on a high
Get back, lay down, go low
Subdivision smile
Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
Oh yeah, burn (Junkies on a high)
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
Oh yeah

// Take The Money And Crawl //

High on a low life
Hit me with a dull knife
Sweet soul sickness
Can I get a witness?

This is the wildlife
I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please"
When I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl

Illegal tender
Going on a bender
Cold-blooded killers
Of all motherfuckers

Well, I'm a nervous wreck
Enough to make you sick
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck
But I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl

This is the wildlife
I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please"
When I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl
So you can take a walk
Or you can suck my cock
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck
But I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl

// Graffitia //

Another one down at the mining town
Breakin' it down for the lame wager
Callin' the shots from the capital (Whoa-oh)
But all that we got was the banks of hope

Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?

This city isn't big enough for dreamers
We were all believers
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)

Another black kid was shot in town (Whoa-oh)
A man with a badge and a daytime show
Darkness falls on Graffitia (Whoa-oh)
Death of a town in the afterglow

Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?

All souls go to heaven in Graffitia
Singing Hallelujah
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)
If we're goin' down for a good time
Life during war time
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)

Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten? (Another one down at the mining town)
Are we the long lost love? (Breakin' it down for the lame wager)
Are we the last forgotten? (Callin' the shots from the capital)
Are we the long lost love? (All that we got was the banks of hope)

Another one down at the mining town
(Are we the last forgotten?)
Callin' the shots from the capital
(Are we the last forgotten?)
Another one down at the mining town
(Are we the last forgotten?)
Callin' the shots from the capital
(Are we the last forgotten?)
