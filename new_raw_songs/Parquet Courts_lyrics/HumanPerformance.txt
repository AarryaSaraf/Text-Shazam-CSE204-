// Dust //

It comes through the window
It comes through the floor
It comes through the roof
And it comes through the door

Dust is everywhere
Sweep
Sweep
Dust is everywhere
Sweep

It sneaks in ignored
It stacks up around
It follows, now swallow
You're biting it now

Suffocate, suffocate
Breathe
Dust is everywhere
Sweep

It comes through the window
It comes through the floor
It comes through the roof
And it comes through the door

Dust is everywhere
Sweep
Sweep
Dust is everywhere
Sweep

// Human Performance //

I know exactly, where I was when I
First saw you the way I see you now, through these eyes, waiting to retry

Those pristine days I, recall so fondly
So few are trials when a life isn't lonely, and now if only

I'd never felt it, I'd never heard it
I know I loved you did I even deserve it, when you returned it

There's no suspicion, no hesitation
Believing through the eyes of sore, adoration

Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house, closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours

Ashtray is crowded, bottle is empty
No music plays and nothing moves with-out drifting, into a memory

Busy apartment, no room for grieving
Sink full of dishes and no trouble believing, that you are leaving

Mid-sentence tremors, mind at its weakest
One way of shaking off the thoughts that it sleeps with

Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house, closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours

In walks the darkness, I pitch without you
Asks me do I realize what I'd done and who I'd done to, indeed I do know

It never leaves me, just visits less often
It isn't gone and I won't feel its grip soften, without a coffin

Breathing beside me, feeling its warmness
Phantom affection gives a human, performance

Witness and know, fracture and hurt
Eyes in the fire, blink unrehearsed
Shield like a house, closing its doors
Curved in the dark, rinses of yours

// Outside //

I saw a name in the graveyard that I knew
Glowing, like the neon in a lounge light
Spelled just the same as the twinge that crawls through you
As it, passes slowly through a fast night
Dear everything i've harmed the fault lies on my tongue
And I, take it holy as a last rite
I picked away all the gray hairs that i'd grown
That remained on the

Outside
And I'm wound tight
And bound by
The secrets you saved
The pieces you kept
They've risen and slept
Without you

I tried to break all the objects that I threw
When I, kept the tidiness of town life
I tried to sing all the verses that I knew
Of it, screaming softly in a loud mic
How do i blame all my carelessness on you
Tell me, taking is mostly what it sounds like
Hard words to sing but I laughed cause they were true
And it's seen on the

Outside
And I'm wound tight
And bound by
The pieces you saved
The secrets you kept
They've risen and slept
Without you

// I Was Just Here //

My keys don't work
This knob don't turn
My eyes feel like
Cigarette burnt
I'll cut my hair
But I don't care
I'll brush my teeth
That's good for me
Apologies
It's been two weeks
Should I unwind
And go to sleep?
Creature comforts
Straight from the source
I was just here
I was just here
My mind's worn out
Without a doubt
A cancelled plan
You understand
Just stopping by
Another time
I must have lost
My train of thought
You look so nice
Chinese fried rice
Wouldn't you know
That place just closed

I was just here
I was just here
I was just here
I was just here
I was just here

// Paraphrased //

Paraphrased
Can't be quoted it's hard to say
Paralyzed
Doesn't move it just blinks its eyes
Paranoid
Just another trap to avoid
Parallel
Never crosses, goes straight as hell

It's child-like persuading
It's night-time lactating
It's pre-season training
Object
A doorman's composure
A patient's disclosure
Imposter's exposure
Subject

Understood
No confession, you said it good
Undeclared
Doesn't know if it's live or dead
Undesired
Cannot see that its charm expired
Unconcerned
When interest cannot be returned

It's christened, the entry
It's paid off this century
It's here, evidently
Object
An actor portraying
A cleric obeying
Informer betraying
Subject

Sometimes my
Thoughts are infrequent explosions
Sometimes I
Drop definition from my words
Sometimes my
Speech recalls moments of violence
Sometimes I
Can't be repeated, I can't be
Paraphrased
No

// Steady On My Mind //

"Where could I start?"
Those are the words I write
A late sentiment a bit misplaced
But that comes as no surprise
At a loss, I'm overwhelmed
Like my memory over time
Just remember that I'll keep you in
A place that I can find
Steady on my mind

You know when it all moves too quick
And can get out of hand?
Sometimes I need a reprieve
I know you'll understand
You lift the weight in the distance
When my eloquence subsides
And I'll always hold you close
When you can't be by my side
Steady on my mind

Wherever you may stay
That's where I'll return
I've never felt committed to much
But that don't mean that I can't learn
To dedicate and reciprocate
What you send my way
And I promise that I'll say "hello"
As often as "goodbye"
Steady on my mind

// One Man, No City //

Where I'm from, well no one lived there.
I look back now, nothing's changed.
Where I'm from now, still no one lives there.
Look back again and lock the door.
Yeah, I maintain, I still remain
One man solitary and no city.
One man solitary and no city.
One man solitary and no city.

"Cogito ergo sum" people say,
But think again 'cause I have no faith.
I find building blocks filled with nothing.
Seen an ink blot page and I said nothing.
"Outside? I'll check it out it's just a mirror."
"Look back now!" An empty page.
Yet I maintain, I still remain,
One man solitary and no city.
One man solitary and no city.
One man solitary and no city.

No town and no city
No identity and no city
No thoughts, no feelings and no city
No, you just me I think and no city
No words I speak and no city
No outside and no city
Nothing at all and no city
No way home and no city
No relief and no city
No sympathy and no city
No understanding and no city
There's no one else and no city
Yet I maintain, I still remain,
One man solitary and no city

// Berlin Got Blurry //

DÃ¶ner wrapper done right, an extinguished
Crotch of a rollie inside yellow fingers
Nothing lasts but nearly everything lingers in life

Cellphone service is not that expensive
But that takes commitment and you just don't have it
It feels so effortless to be a stranger
But feeling foreign is such a lonely habit

You can't crop yourself out of a picture
You're out of focus but still framed inside

Well Berlin got blurry
And my heart started hurting for you

Loud mouth living got you some attention
And second chances given without doubt
'Guess you've got a history but it's not worth a mention tonight

Kind ears captive to the beers you've purchased
Sipping through scenes of plastered confession
Telling pretty stories, is it your sole purpose?
Telling everybody that you learned your lesson

But no one's falling for that nice guy bullshit
They waited years, you can wait one night

Well Berlin got blurry
When my eyes started telling it to

Funny how it charms you, that Teutonic frankness
Listen and it arms you with a new type of patience
Maybe it alarms you because it tastes so familiar and wild

French fries, hot dog, ketchup, main ingredients
Swears in flawless English it's the best in town
Funny how a sameness can not be distinguished
Strangeness is relieving when you point it out

But email poems slogans an example
Of three things I can't unify

Well Berlin got blurry
As my thoughts all hurried to you

// Keep It Even //

There's a drawer in my house that I try
To keep closed but it's open. there's
A commitment that I made to be
Somewhere but it's broken. an oblique
Mantra in my head it lies there on
The floor like a bed that would
Collapse like a trap, if it was spoken
You gotta keep it even, even when
You're uptight

Even when you're happy
Even when you're reaching for some
Line I've had in mind, it's been re-
Pressed over time, so I'm breathing
Seduced by an excuse that could
Not be made but I'm speaking

There's a phone with a number that
I try not to call but it's ringing
For someone I've tried to keep to
Myself but I'm singing. it's logic
That's twisted and paraphrased and
Justified by a distance that separates
A bond, bound of persistence

You gotta keep it even, even when
You're uptight
Even when you're happy
Even when you're reaching for
That drawer in my house that I try
To keep closed but its open

// Two Dead Cops //

Framed plant portrait
On the wall
Christmas commercial
How many times
Somebody shouted
"Last call"
And I knew he means it
At least this night
Stained white sweater
Fluorescent light
One quarter short
"Get me next time"
Somebody shouted
"Get outside"
And we fell in rank to
Watch him bolt by
"Where the fuck is he?"
"Down the stairs"
"What did he look like?"
"Dark and tall"

Somebody shouted
"They had it coming!"
"Freeze!"
Bang!
Bang!
"Shoot!"

Protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do

Protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do

When shots are heard
When lives are lost
Nobody cries in the ghetto
For two dead cops

Off duty portrait
Cracked from the cold
Guadalupe candle
No permit for fire
Bears holding hearts
And some a rose
Said a police bastard
"We lost two lives"

G train delayed
"What else is new"
B 43 dead
"Called a car"
Tompkins is blocked
And there's helicopters
Flood lights and guards
Somebody follows you
Home in the dark
Can't look back
All the gates are down
He could do anything
There's no one around
Plant a bag in my pants

Protect you
Is what they want, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
[x4]

Nobody cries in the ghetto
For two dead cops

// Pathos Prairie //

Faster than hope flies cold through my veins
Faster than cruelty could drain it out
I commit crimes and I call them mistakes
Nothing denies like a heart in doubt
This I know!
People flow like streams where I bathe
Then drift along to a foreign place
The past like a servant that bends for our sake
Into the lines we tell it to trace

Like how we are wired
Like how we decide
Like how we are taught
Like how we are not
Like how we hide ourselves in vain

Laughter in sunshine, laughter in pain
Keeps pace of heart in an honest life
But after the fondness for life is erased
What races on in my soul besides
Rabid mutts that fight and fuck and howl till they faint
They too run on when the moon is lit
Faster than love turns itself into rage
Faster than i attempt to forget

Like how we desire
Like how we embrace
Like how we give up
Like how we make love
Like how we taste
When we're spit away

Like how we are wild
Like how we are pure
Like how we despise
Like how we tell lies
Like how we're sure that we're gonna change
That we're gonna change [x2]

// It's Gonna Happen //

Earth's plastic faces feel cold and
Uncommon like they've got some
Place to be
So turn to me
They always come around
I'm not an imposter
I'm not an imposter
At first old conventions seemed
Staged and uncommon
It's gonna happen every single time
So rehearse with me in mind

// Already Dead //

Dead, forgot how long it's been
A dusty trunk where you can find your junk ruined
I'm already dead
Alarm clock in my head
That's just who I am
A broken dial you watch
When you're sleeping in
Torn up beyond repair
I'm laid out threadbare
I'm wash-stained clothes that's filled with holes
That can't be sewn
My thoughts are rocks upstairs
Bones are just mortar for my organs
'Cause I'm already

[female spoken voice:]
Instrumental break
With your eyes open, or your eyes closed
Take a moment to connect with where you are
Feel your feet on the ground
Without looking at anything at all
Just listen
Rest with a sense of hearing
Experience the show of sound
That is happening around you right now
Life in stereo
Allow the instruments into your globe of sound
And when the next part comes along
Let it be there
Without engaging, just listening to the sounds
And wish them well as they pass on through

Dead
My blood's all filled with lead
A crooked leaky cup to keep your pencils in
I'm already dead
A landfill here I said
Really got no place
I'm just some waste compressed
I'm already dead
