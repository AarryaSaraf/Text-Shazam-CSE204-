// Bodies Made Of //

Bodies made of slugs and guts
Bodies made of slugs and guts
Rusted bench seats been stuck in ruts full of bodies
Made of slugs and guts
Sludged all the way through the mud to orate to some
Bodies made of slugs and guts
Mister's suit was stained like a sweatshop
I said, "It's my soul, I wanna keep it on the inside."

Bodies made of sparks and dust
Slumped and prone to the lore and lust
Christened, then soaked futile
Listless souls dampened the aisle of bodies made of slugs and guts
Spoke like a layman but resounded like tongues to the bodies made of
Slugs and guts
He spit when he spoke and sang like a wasp nest
I said, "It's my soul, I wanna keep it on the inside"

// Black And White //

Nothing makes my heart so wild as being
In possession of a potent night
Racing down the stairs in a nude descension
Shedding and discarding my hide
But the bold strokes crack so quickly
And it's often that I wonder why
Dripping at the slow-motion rate of surrender
Hanging to my bones as they dry
How can I want something more than a new hell in which to fry
When I see in mostly black and white?

There's a sinful sort of side of being
So contained, a bit like being lost
Stumbling through the background like a small town loner
Quietly a-whisperin' my thoughts into my cupped hands
Folded and monk-like, at least that's what I've always said
How does writing letters from the lonely margins feel
When there is no hair on my head?
Is the solitude I seek a trap where I've been blindly led?
Tell me, where then do I go instead?

When atonement comes in distant waves
I might wait until the next to break
Choking through forgiveness at a sunfly prompter
Staring through the back of my face
Its a vulgar, hidden part of being tethered to the world right now;
Spending all my dollars to remain a member
Nothing in my eyes but a scowl
Do I bother to define myself beyond what they allow?
Have I already forgotten how?

// Dear Ramona //

An air of self delusion that no two arms could ever contain
This lady is a hypnosis poet and when she speaks her words weep like rain
She tiptoes through the side streets in the morning and wears dark sunshades at night
However she might be spending her time I don't know you'd have to ask her neighbors

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
My dear Ramona

Born in some unnatural state that no one father would claim
This daughter saving up commissions from acting but no one's ever seen her play
She fixes breakfast for two in the morning and drinks dark coffee at night
Whoever she might be going to bed with, you can read about that in her Moleskine

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
My dear Ramona

// What Color Is Blood? //

What color is blood? Still the same that it was?
Is it still good at what it does? (Bleeding)
Cause I've been needing a new vein line
Going from my guts to my heart to my mind
What's sharp as a knife, followed me all my life
Waits never rests, till it eats me alive?
Snarlin', darlin I don't fear nothing
Gushing, I can hear myself leak
I'm roaming outside of the signal
Where it slips in and out
Charges apply, but your heart beats louder
Beyond the dominion of doubt

Excuse me as I slip on out

How is agency built in a life unfulfilled?
Tanned slow and low in the amines of guilt
Hung, stretched, beaten and dried like skin
Smooth, new and shiny but so paper-thin
What tastes like betrayal, gazes naked and pale?
Sneaks into you like it got outta jail?
The blues creeping down you from your head to your tail
The kind that don't let you sing along
I'm listening to a different station
Frequent on a different band
Slightly harder to find but with tuning and time
You won't touch that dial again

Excuse me as I slip on out

// Vienna II //

"How'd it die?"
We broke its neck
We raised it to the power of ten
Gurre-Lieder
They cheered my name
No punches thrown
Their joy
My shame

Nobody wanted to be
"Vienna II"
Someone had to be
"Vienna II"
So I let it be
"Vienna II"
Let it be me

// Always Back In Town //

Always back in town
Always at your door
Always marking days
Off the calender
Always my last night
Always saying goodbye
Always hear your roar
Always see your stripes
Always passing through
Always hanging my hat
Always on my mind
Always "Feed my cat?"

And I'm always packing my bags
I'm always back in town
According to you

Always back in town
Always making amends
Always staying clean
Always on again
Always gone for good
Always "How it's been?"
Always find my room
Just as I left it
Always won't be long
Always never call
Always leaving soon
Always back for more

And I'm always packing my bags
I'm always back in town
According to you

Always back in town
Always at your door
Always marking days
Off the calender
Always my last night
Always saying goodbye
Always hear your roar
Always see your stripes
Always passing through
Always hanging my hat
Always on my mind
Always "Feed my cat?"

And I'm always packing my bags
I'm always back in town
According to you

// She's Rolling //

She's rolling down a hill
And I
Can still see her
When I close my eyes

She's racing through the dark
And I
Can feel her burning in the back of my mind

// Sunbathing Animal //

One creature I return to, one habit I neglect
I cannot slow the pace at which I yearn
Frank and unabashed I become a frozen servant
Smiling asking nothing in return
Fang-tooth woman foaming at the mouth as she addressed me
Not with moving lips, but with the rabid wild arresting
Words not yet intended to identify emotion
Scrawling bold and oblique in my head
I've hung out at your service jobs
I've watched you, waited and be ignored
Bled into the clatter, as they sipped at what you poured
I cling to your perimeter as you float in their margins
Oblivious to being stung, there satellite becomes my son
I've flown into that trap before
When things have gotten dark
In the depths of strangers glances lies the most ferocious spark

Most freedom is deceiving
If such a thing exists
When I was young I knew but didn't care
Faces change and shape to represent the same old beast
I want to flee but I can only stare
It's the sound a captive heart makes as it sizzles into vapor
The title hum of fondness like a spike-wave oscillator
The rabid UV grin that beckons me into approaching
Grasping as it recedes into space
Who greets me first when I arise
Who breaking into my half shut eyes
It's in the blaze of your embrace where I feel more real and alive
The bosom of 1000 watts into my skin into my guts
Running circles so proud until he got caught
In his brief emancipation he can feel what I cannot

There's a patch of light that hits the floor I'll often occupy
Stretch my arms and legs and close my eyes
I now can hear my pulse alone, this manic pace I cannot slow
I do not miss the child you stole
Frying and abiding, I'm in your control
Like a sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sun

// Instant Disassembly //

Mamacita, catch me now as I sink
Into darkness I thought to be extinct
Chilled my eyeballs as the curtains were torn
And shed a light so bright
Shining like the day I was born

Mamasita, take from me what I stole
Oh, I get a look from you that strips me
To a blank page in my soul
Like the left open window ignored
It cuts to my core when I see you cry

Mamasita, I've prepared my defense
Flawed as ever in the drunkest tense
Kept repeating, kept repeating myself
In my native tongue the parlance of problem itself

Mamasita, hold me now as I ache
She's got a real firm grip and she's rockin'
Trying to shake me awake
Turn on the white noise murmur of the AM band
And the last classic rock band's last solid record creeps in
A call out of the blue from an old, old friend

Instant, instant disassembly

Mamasita, into pieces I fall
Oh, you did your heart no favors
Darling, when you taught me to crawl
Don't beseech me for the answers you seek
Oh, I kept explaining that I was too tired
To continue to speak

Mamasita, hear me now I insist
Oh, you've got to trust me when I say
Long for something better than this
Kept repeating, kept repeating myself
There's nothing left to dismantle
The house it just collapsed on itself

Instant, instant disassembly

Mamasita, tie me loose as I flee
Oh, it seems that you've got a spotlight
Cast on the dark side of me
I feel a pain so acute like I'm being impaled
And I can't breathe, can't breathe, it's hard to inhale

And it's worth repeating
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
When you're near
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
It's hard to inhale yeah
I can't breathe, I can't breatheâ¦

// Ducking & Dodging //

You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit this lock no more
That key you've got won't fit this lock no more
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't let you in my door
That key you've got won't let you in my door

My eyes have seen the glory and
The sound and image, synchronized
Right there on the silver screen
Heard the sounds suggesting
Lineage of influence, yeah
Saw it there in the motherland
Steps and gables, steeples, stairways
Wind away from origin
In untrampled vintage floats the proof
I cannot be freed
The concert stage, the velvet cage
The glass perimeter of me
All my friends are disappearing
All my letters are in codes
All I ever think and feel
In your shadow, it erodes
Waiting, waiting by the silent phone
I draft my next apology
Burn my letters once they're read
Unalloyed joy, I thrice repeat
Unalloyed joy
Unalloyed joy
Listen to what I just heard
It's written on the sun, jailbird
And just like you
The way it moves
A fog that creeps in, grinning always
In your hair
And in your hallways
Got detained in San Francisco
On your way to get fresh air
The U.S.A. didn't want you there
Juggled oranges, but no one cared

You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more

You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't won't let you in that door
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more

Lady Macbeth, rock me mama
Like my back ain't got no bone
Like clicks heard on the telephone
Like a sudden unhinged moan
That leaks out from your broken structure
Like a wall of unbound stone
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
They said the finale was a formal reply
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
They said the finale was a formal reply
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
Buried everything, I'm telling you guy
Contest prizes, grand pianos
Gagged by comfort, shamed by words
Empty anthems, cloaked in strange fur
Stripes and bars, is it yours?
Stripes and bars
Stripes and bars
Stripes and bars, and are you sure?
Stripes and bars will lock you in
Lock you in or camouflage you
Feel the sun, but cannot walk to
Hear the yelp, but cannot talk to
Trembling, cloaked in what you swore
Were stripes and bars
That's what they're for
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more

// Raw Milk //

Awake in an unmade nest, peepers hacking into day
I've heard that sound so many times
It terrifies and comforts me
Scratching at the door
It's time
First she summons, next she feeds
And I'm going back home to my old used-to-be

Chula dances for me like a dervish whirling
In my eyes
Spin around me rabid child
I won't see you for some time...

She gets feisty when she's been drinking
Never can tell what the hell she's thinking
Smiles like she's got one eye winking at you
Dog walkers in the living room and the
Strange one is in the kitchen and she's
Brewing something bitchin
Just for you

// Into the Garden //

Time waits over
Behind your shoulder
And the onset of your wandering years
Until you're not the same old fool you once took yourself for

Let me slip into
My insomniac shoes
Step out the door
Into the garden of my unpaid dues
