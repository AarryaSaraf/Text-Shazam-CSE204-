// Master Of My Craft //

I got a gold medal record time, gold record, diamond mine
Name in print, tongue, t-shirts and minds
Thread count - high
Commissions - high
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Forget about it

I didn't come here to dream or teach the world things,
Define paradigms, or curate no livin' days,
With high thread counts and staircases high.
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Forget about it

Thread count - high
Commissions - high
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Forget about it

People die I don't care, you should see the wall of ambivalence I'm building
I got no love for the living
Thread count - high
Commissions - high
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Forget about it

Death to all false profits around here we praise a dollar you fuckin' hippie
Wanna walk around in my shoes and then tell me how it feels
Thread count - high
Commissions - high
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Forget about it

From the hands of my mother, said I'm master of my craft

Thread count - high
Commissions - high
Hourly rates - high
A minute of your time?
Ya know Socrates died in the fuckin' gutter!

// Borrowed Time //

I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling of the museless existence
Of the drunk, bored and listless
Endless waiting for something that I knew wasn't coming

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this

I was up to my neck in motivation neglect when
I felt soft waves of purpose crashing onto the surface
I was feeling nostalgic for the days when
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this

// Donuts Only //

Like a red state's Baptist fervor.
Like a small town's unsolved murder.
Some secrets are just best resting in the tombs of buried thought-slums.
As for Texas: donuts only - you cannot find bagels here.
And I'll reserve my highest Hosannas
For the communion song that served with light beer,
And a chorus that inspires the score played in my myth-steeped years.

"There's a hole you shan't fall into,"
Sang the church choir's young male leeds,
In our home team's jersey robes sewn by our sisters, moms and nieces.
This you gave us, although worthless, fed five decades' dormant hustle.
In result, his life was rubbish.
Celebrated? Yes, but rubbish.

// Yr No Stoner //

Two young fingers in wet cement
There's a new impression built in front of my apartment
BG & EE that's so sweet
I wonder what E's gonna say when she sees

It's a pretty far walk to the DMV

Storm chasin' hippies at a discount mall
Megaphone muppet poster on the wall
Speaking in stones like we've never heard before
You take the risk, I'll get the reward

I don't know too much I just got the keys

There's billionaire buses on my unlit street
Hey who's that walkin' up? That looks like E
Let's hide in the bushes so that we can hear her say
"Who would build a monument for me anyway?"

That's B! BG! He'll build it for you babe
You know BG, he'll give you what you need

// Yonder Is Closer To The Heart //

Pocket contents: Rizla pack, spare change, receipts in wads
Stacked in camps across my desk, each day another pile
Time was measured in balls of lent, laundry claim tags and number of cents
It takes to drown your brain into a just-dowsed former fire

Coffee breaks and lamb's tail shakes aren't arbitrary marks
Paycheck stubs, good sex and drugs can fade away distractions of the
Mantras of "keep going" that are lodged into my thoughts
They replay on days when yonder is closer to the heart

This thickness is just enough to wade through

Pocket contents: Rizla pack, spare change, receipts in wads
Stacked in camps across my desk, each day another pile
Time was measured in balls of lent, laundry claim tags and number of cents
It takes to drown your brain into a just-dowsed former fire

Coffee breaks and lamb's tail shakes aren't arbitrary marks
Paycheck stubs, good sex and drugs can fade away distractions of the
Mantras of "keep going" that are lodged into my thoughts
They replay on days when yonder is closer to the heart

This thickness is just enough to wade through

// Careers In Combat //

There are no more summer lifeguard jobs
There are no more art museums to guard
The lab is out of white lab coats
Cause there are no more slides and microscopes
But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my son

There are no more roles on TV shows
There are no road-cone dispensing jobs
There are no spots left for park ranger
Cause there are no bears left to save you from
But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my son

// Light Up Gold I //

There are no more summer lifeguard jobs
There are no more art museums to guard
The lab is out of white lab coats
Cause there are no more slides and microscopes
But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my son

There are no more roles on TV shows
There are no road-cone dispensing jobs
There are no spots left for park ranger
Cause there are no bears left to save you from
But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my son

// Light Up Gold II //

Twice an era comes a knock at my door
Suspended in a window-crashing gaze of a poor spark of recognition
It's the thrill that dies first, but
I can think of something worse: the curse, the curse
Light up gold was the color of something I was looking for
Light up gold was the color of something I was looking for

Steady was the pace kept in that tear-leaking sway
Sifting like a miner through the conscience debris
Hunched down, gleaning embers from a burning field
Trying to find something warm and real

Cause light up gold was the color of something I was looking for
Light up gold was the color of something I was looking for

Yeah light up gold was the color of something I was looking for
Light up gold was the color of something I was looking for

// N Dakota //

Train death paintings, anti-meth murals
Color the ghettos of N. Dakota
Bismark tractor association, coffee and toothpaste
This was vacation
I saw, while squinting, the hidden layer
In those lost-era grain elevators
Feudal beginnings, amber wave looseness
Post-Nordic grinning tired and toothless

Cigarette advertisement country
Wild and perfect, but lacking something
In Manitoba they called it boring
At night we hum to Canada's snoring
Westbound taken, exiled Texan
From a former Dutch trade encampment
Former slave quarters tucked by the alley
Serf population too high to tally

// Stoned & Starving //

I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so stoned and starving

I was reading ingredients
Asking myself "should I eat this?"
I was so stoned and starving

I was scratching off silver ink
I was deciding what to drink
I was so stoned and starving

I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so stoned and starving

I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so stoned and starving

I was debating Swedish Fish
Roasted peanuts or licorice
I was so stoned and starving

I was holding some wadded bills
I was reading that smoking kills
I was so stoned and starving

I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so stoned and starving

// No Ideas //

What could I even say to you Rene?
If I could stop reacting then I'd be acting like your fool because
What could I even say to you Rene?
I could follow you but then you'd never see me right behind you

I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas

What could I even say to you Rene?
I could meditate and sleep all day but
I'd never know what the first step to take was
What could I even say to you Rene?
Are we candles or are we wax, and with facts like that I'll never know how to relax

I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink and he found my brain
And I have no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas

// Caster Of Worthless Spells //

We measured the distance of the space between islands
Gazing out into the river Styx she said "It's no river at all
It's a tidal estuary," was her only line, she delivered it well
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

They called it the pyrex age, the glass dawn of our thought process
Later to be chronicled in violent history books
"You suffer" on karaoke, cause there was no English translation for hell
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

// Disney P.T. //

My girl is a bowl of hash, a familiar looking rash
My girl's my secret stash, my shampooed pile of trash
My girl's a borealis-lit fjord
My girl's a summons ignored
My girl's a beer, freshly poured
A lost tribe's library stored

You've been getting lots of similes but I want your disease
I want your disease
I want your disease

My girl is off-track betting
My girl is a traffic light
My girl is an unmade bed
My girl is a moonless night
My girl is choppy air
My girl is a Golden Corall
My girl is a curse word screamed
My girl is not their scene

You've been getting lots of similes but I want your disease
I want your disease
I want your

// Tears O Plenty //

I drank right from your tears of plenty and
I exchanged all the gifts you sent me
Dreary beats over fast-rapped verses
Leaked through windows in hatchback hearses

Snacker's conference at the buffet table
Double dip in the goose pate mold
Posthumous pranks left in the casket
Plain Jane shining in her spotlight moment

She lived for the same moments we did
Morning coffee refilled and endless
He stumbled into some dinero
Weeping at the wake like a Catholic hero

// Picture Of Health //

My last guilt-themed solicitation
Delivered slowly in hesitation
It could not soothe me, could not seduce me
Into repainting these strokes so loosely
How I remember my ex-blue t-shirt
Where the hole in it fell

Plain-dressed, wilting and wired
You were the picture of health

Wine glass drowning, postponed narration
Make every new drag no mere frustration
I fell in debt to those country crooners
Mourning lost love like Spanish funerals
Dye the grey hair you grew in secret
To a root-colored shell

Frozen mid-sentenced smile
You were the picture of health
No prognosis implied
You were the picture of health
Plain-dressed, wilting and wired
You were the picture of health
