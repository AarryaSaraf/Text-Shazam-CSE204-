Album: SympathyForLife

// Walking At A Downtown Pace //

I'm making plans for the day all of this is through
Seeing my path and hearing the song I'll sing
And food that I'll taste and all the drinks that I'll consume
Return the smile on an unmasked friend
As we take streets I don't walk down 'cause I want to avoid
Fighting temptation, walk at a downtown pace
And treasure the crowds that once made me act so annoyed
Sometimes I wonder how long 'til I'm a face in one?

You'd be surprised to learn what you could bear to lose
Wanting and needing, not getting either one
And planning the future as if time is yours to choose
Pick out a movie, a sandwich from a screen
Yeah, how many days in life will I spend underground?
Hours in total, as many as it takes
And how many ways of feeling lousy have I found?
Lately uncounted

I've found a reason to exist
Written on the tile
Of the platform wall
Begging not to go extinct
To all those who saw

How many times now have I walked into that room
With the day shining through purple film?
Combining sound from the corners that you use yourself to tune
Like a piano, well-tuned and walking slowly
Socks on the carpet while some kid watches my shoes
Feeling the sine like a bolt of lightning
House of dreams, you were once my cure for New York City blues
Is this goodbye then?

Will you be on the other side?
Waiting there for me?
Nothing left to want
Cashing in my claim to a life lived mostly free

On the other side
Waiting there for me
Nothing left to want
Cashing in my claim to a life lived mostly free

// Black Widow Spider //

I'm trying to forget about someone I love
I'm trying to leave a person behind
I'm trying not to think about someone dear
But trying don't work sometimes
I'm trying not to picture a face I saw
A face that has been burned in my mind
I'm trying not to think of seeing it again
Was that the final time?

I'm trying to save the money for something I want
Something I hope will give peace of mind
But peace comes in pieces of pea-sized bits
Will I get enough in time?
I go out to a movie in the city
When I can't seem to shake off a mood
I like to watch an actor and act like them
Pretend I'm a different dude

Eyes on my every move
Black widow spider
Climb, climb, climb into me
Black widow spider

I never wanted nothing from no one
No, I never asked for anything more
But lies are to be suffered and never told
The way I did before
I'm trying to forget about someone I love
I'm trying to leave the person behind
I'm trying not to think about someone dear
But trying don't work sometimes

Always my company
Black widow spider
Climb, climb, climb into me
Black widow spider

// Marathon Of Anger //

This city has changed as the kettle got tighter
We changed our shape and shot the truth up like a cure
We've got the power
The streets are walkin', a marathon of anger

Now it's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)
It's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)

Our hands is wringin', neighborhood is wakin'
Nostalgia Rx, discontinued 2020
We've got the power
More than surviving a marathon of anger

Now it's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)
It's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)

// Just Shadows //

Delivery, mouth watering
Optimized for pleasure it seems
I fucks with it not
It can't be helped, thy police state
Fodder to a vast database
Under influence
Trash goes in green, glass goes in blue
This heart of mine's audience to
Pesky inner voice

Then suddenly I am alone
In the truest sense of the word
With nothing else to hear or watch
Just shadows
Like an inmate that's finished his term

My merry way, on it I saw
Civilization rise and fall
Now you've gone and done
Algorithm waltz sets the pace
Indicates an authentic taste
Tell me what I love
No cleaning charge, no shipping fee
Holy and hosed off like a beast
Economic crash

Then suddenly everything's calm
And there's black winter mud on your feet
And the thick net of fibers that you passed through
Are like a memory you dragged to delete

Amazon fire, twenty percent off
Global cost, vast species death
Suggested for you
Curated life agrees with me
Programmed to know when I should sleep
And when to wake up
Preferences set, authorizing
Life is not as modern as it seems
Can't pick you who you love

// Plant Life //

Hanging on a limb warm from the wind
Cracking in the night just like a whip
Grown up a plastic commodity
Domestic rain will sanitize the scene

Natural inclination
Wicked, it sure stacks up pretty quick
The soil's got a fever!

Fever
Fever
Fever
Fever

Once just letters pressed in wet cement
Ink turned them to names on a debtor's list
Just loose leafs sat shakin' in a cell
While cinder blocks, they pile all around

Natural inclination
Left to grow and now we're in the shade
The soil's got a fever!

Fever
Fever
Fever
Fever

Fever
Fever
Fever
Fever

Fever
Fever
Fever
Fever

// Application/Apparatus //

Application, soothing like a mother's voice
Speaks instructions to me in my native tongue
Bluetooth option paying for itself in stars
Conversation difficult with anyone

Operating mechanism with a name
Limo license picture shows a friendly face
Information liquid-crystal looking glass
Navigation effortless as shifting lanes

Crowd-sourced data, satellite delivery
"This is for your people," I was told to say
Destination entered into a machine
Unfamiliar neighborhood, but not for her

Soft narration in a soothing female voice
Body reacts, I'm thinking of something else
Rear-view mirror, foreign conversation eyes
Silent greeting, executed flawlessly

Apparatus subject to an engine's will
Arrow pointing digital light to a field
Time and distance factored into everything
Cop rehearsal, say what you were told to say

Mass migration, occupying forces stayed
Satisfaction rating advertised with pride
Rebel soldiers, freedom fighters some would say
Charging cable offered as a sign of peace

Waiting for a stranger on a crowded street
Urban living standards rising constantly
Western cities, people driving orderly
Phone-card hustle, calculation constantly

Friendly speaker tells me "In 1,000 feet"
5G signal, guides my hands to shift the gears
Grim reminder, war cannot be truly fled
Worker status on the dash for all to see

Young people enjoying urban habitation
Headlights beaming with western potential
Carried though a noisy, crowded city
Carriage sleeping children into the light of morning

The operating mechanism
Returns to its resting human state

// Homo Sapien //

What a time to be alive
A TV set in the fridge
A voice that recites the news
And leaves out the gloomy bits
A god for the modern soul
With even, paternal speech
Hardwired to your desire
The meaning of luxury
Ever since the stone we carved
The ore that became the blade
The spices we died to trade
The gun that we used to say

"Stand straight up and down"
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently

The sensual touch of glass
So smooth on the fingertips
The erotic quality of not feeling meaningless
Reflecting a lovely gaze
Commanding and amorous
A matte-finished wishing well
Seductive and glamorous
The primal desire to fuck
The primitive urge to kill
The endorphins of the hunt
Jump like begging dogs

Standing straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently

// Sympathy For Life //

Hands free
I bet you are
Touch, scream
Express yourself
Feel free
Come one common feeling

Reaching out for anything
And hold on to a sympathy

Be here
Now you are
Lose all
Distraction from
Hands on a shoulder for
React reaction

The motion it communicates
To hold on to a sympathy

Hands free
I bet you are
Touch, scream
Express yourself
Feel free
Come one common feeling

The motion it communicates
To hold on to a sympathy

// Zoom Out //

We got dancing
We got screaming
We got laughin'
And we got feelin'
We got smokin'
We got dreaming
We got relations
And we got feelin'

When you zoom out tomorrow is now
When you zoom out together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passÃ©
When you zoom out tomorrow is now
When you zoom out together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passÃ©

We got louder
We got sleeping
We got heaven
And we got feelin'
We got sunset
We got moonlight
We got ego
And we got feeling

When you zoom out tomorrow is now
When you zoom out together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passÃ©
When you zoom out tomorrow is now
When you zoom out together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passÃ©

// Trullo //

I've grown tired of living inside a house that's not a head
Tempted to the porch, walk through the door, that's how it's fed
A bedlike tongue to cradle my bones and hair to catch the rain
I've grown bored of living inside a house without a brain

And now I'm staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball

I've grown tired of living inside a house that's not a head
Two glass eyes to wash so it cries the fingerprints from it
I'll build two, and one will be blue, the other will be pink
I am done with living inside a house that cannot think

And now I'm staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball

// Pulcinella //

I want things so much more than I want to sometimes
And it feels like my brain is the binary code's problem now
But I'd rather be stuffed with straw than made of tin
Because the mind wanders home like a cat does
When it knows it's time to feed again

There are some places I won't go near
You can measure their fright by the shade I turn
Right when they're asked about
I drag a chain of faces and names
Some I've cut off, some were lost
Some will always be locked to me

I know you, at least I knew that I'd know you someday
You're no more a stranger than the
Smile that shines out from the moon
And I'm not in the mood to be lonely no more
So I act like someone on familiar terms
With the uneasy side of love

I got so wrecked up waiting for you
Now your cheeks are pushed high
With the salt from your eyes in the taste of them
Who am I when I can't be unwound?
"Darling it's me," as the mask comes off
"It always was"
