// When They Ring Those Golden Bells //

There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by fate you see
Yes I want to see my Jesus shake his hand and hear him greet us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells a ringing can't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
[ ac.guitar + banjo ]
When our days have known the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
There'll be no more stormy weather we'll live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells a ringing...

// Peace In The Valley //

Oh well I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till my Lord comes and calls me calls me away oh yes
Oh well the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
And the night night is as black as the sea oh yes
There will be peace peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness no sorrow no troubles I'll see
There will be peace peace in the valley for me
[ ac.guitar ]
Well the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down down by the lamb oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by little child
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am oh yes
There will be peace...

// If I Could Hear My Mother Pray Again //

How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again if I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be with who means so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
[ ac.guitar ]
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely and always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could hear my mother...

// The Third Man //

Last night, I dreamed I took a walk up Cavalry's lonely hill
The things I saw with my own eyes could not have been more real

I saw up on three crosses, three men in agony
Two cried out for mercy, the third man looked at me
And oh the hurt in this man's eyes just broke my heart in two
It seemed that I could hear him say, "I'm doing this for you"
I knelt beneath the third man's cross and slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet and stained my hands with red
And when I heard him cry in pain, I raised my eyes to see
The blood spilled from the third man's side and some of it spilled on me
The third man wore a crown of thorns, spikes held him to the tree
I heard him say, "Oh God, my God, hast thou forsaken me?"
And there within the mighty crowd, the ones who mocked him cried
"King, save thyself if thy art King" and then the third man died
Suddenly, I heard the thunder roll, saw lightning pierce the sky
The third man was still hanging there and I began to cry
I saw the boulders fall and heard the breaking of the ground
Then I awoke and, though I'd dreamed, I touched my cheek and found

My eyes were wet where I had cried
A dream I wished I new
I still can hear the third man say
"I'm doing this for you"

// How Great Thou Art //

Oh Lord my God when I in all some wonder
Considered all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars I hear the roaring thunder Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul Thy save dear God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
Then sings my soul...
[ ac.guitar ]
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim my God how great Thou art
Then sings my soul...

// Old Camp Meetin' Time //

How I like the old time preachin' prayin' singin' shoutin'
How I like the old time readin' of God's words
How I like to hear that old time hallelujah glory
How I like the old time worship of the Lord

Long ago when just a child at old camp meetin' time
How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Callin' all the saints of God onto the house of prayer
Oh such prayin' singin' shoutin' for the Lord was there
How I like the old time preachin'...
[ banjo ]
Preachin' in them good ole days was still the world acclaim
Preachin' for the souls of men and not for wordly fame
Under such old fashion preachin' sinners knelt and pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way
How I like the old time preachin'...

// When I Hear My Children Pray //

(Someday I'll be strong enough to make that church bells ring
And when my voice grows steady I can help the choir sing
Somehow I can be usefull so put me to the test
I know I can't do very much but Lord I'll do my best)
Last night just at bed time I looked in upon my son
And the picture I saw as I stood there was surely a blessed one
Proudly I watched and listened to all he tried to say
Cause it makes my heart just burst with pride when I hear my children pray
And he said dear Lord I'm just a little boy and I don't know how to pray
But so many of your people has slowly turned away
Well maybe there's something I can do to help in your great plan
I know I can't do very much but I'll do the best I can
Couldn't I light the little candles or maybe sweep the pews
I'll do anything dear Lord just as long as it's for you
Why can I open up the doors or dust your sacred stand
I know I can do something if you'll just hold my hand
Yes proudly I stood and listened to all he tried to say
And it makes my heart just burst with pride when I hear my children pray
(I know I can't do very much but Lord I'll do my best)

// In The Sweet Bye And Bye //

In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore

There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by...
[ guitar ]
To a wonderful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and by...

// Where I Learned To Pray //

In our little one room country school it's where I learned to pray
A church without a steeple that's where I learned to pray
Every Sunday morning about the hour of ten
The door would open to our school the preacher did walk in
He'd smile and say good morning how everything today
We'd bow our heads and close our eyes and then he'd say let's pray
In our little one room country school it's where I learned to pray
Our church that had no steeple is no longer there today
From Monday until Friday at school we'd learn and play
Then back at school on Sunday that's where I learned to pray
[ piano ]
Our clothes were clean but faded sometimes our feet were bare
But no one noticed anything except the Lord was there
We'd come from all directions searching for the way
Harmonizes at school on Sunday that's where I learned to pray
In our little one room...

// I'd Rather Have Jesus //

I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold
I'd rather be his than have riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land
I'd rather be led by his nail scarred hands

Than to be the queen of the best domain
And be held in sin's dreads way
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today

I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause
I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause
I'd rather have Jesus then worldwide fame
I'd rather be true to his holy name

Than to be the queen of the best domain
And be held in sin's dreads way
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today
