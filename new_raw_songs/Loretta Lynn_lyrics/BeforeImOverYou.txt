Album: BeforeImOverYou

// Singing The Blues //

Well I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night
Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you you've got me singing the blues
Well the moon and the stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do but cry cry cry cry over you
Well I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay
Without you you've got me singing the blues
[ ac.guitar ]
Well the moon and the stars...

// Before I'm Over You //

I just can't get it through my head you love another now instead
Can't make myself believe we're really through
I'm walking up and down the hall talking to the silent wall
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
I think I've almost lost my mind I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy yes I know and I don't have far to go
The way you treat me is a shame but I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
[ guitar - piano ]
I keep your letters I should burn I wear your ring I should return
But there's a million foolish things I do
It makes me cry but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
I think I've almost lost my mind...

// You Don't Have To Be A Baby To Cry //

You don't have to be a baby to cry all you need is for love to go wrong
You don't have to be a baby to cry or to lay awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
Then you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes why should I lie you don't have to be a baby to cry
[ ac.guitar ]
When you leave me...
A little bitty baby you don't have to be a baby to cry

// Who'll Help Me Get Over You //

I'll help you get over your old love who'll help me get over you
I furnished the shoulder you cried on when she hurt you by turning you down
You still come to me when you're lonely I love you so I've stayed around
I'll help you get over your old love now my heart is breaking in two
I'll help you get over your lost love who'll help me get over you
[ piano - steel ]
Your heart keeps on searching for someone so I caught you when she let you fall
I've loved you so long now in silence but you'll never love me at all
I'll help you get over your heartbreak now my heart is breaking in two
Who'll help me get over my heartache who'll help me get over you

// Loose Talk //

So long we've been married last burden we've carried
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life all our own
I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone
[ ac.guitar ]
They say you are leavin' that you are deceivin'
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here...
[ steel ]
When I go out walkin' there's lots of loose talkin'
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling that's not true because I still love you and I do with all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

// Where Were You //

(Where were you where were you)
Where were you when you left my heart alone
And the nights you didn't bother to come home
Now you say my love's grown cold I guess it's true
But when loneliness within where were you
Where were you when we lost the love we had
When I wanted you and needed you so bad
Now you're blaming me for things I didn't do
All the nights I spent a crying where were you
The lonely hours were just too much for me with only tears to keep me company
That's what destroyed the love that we once knew
Stop and think when it happened where were you
[ steel ]
The lonely hours were just too much...

// Wine Women And Song //

Well I'm at home a workin' and a slavin' this way
You're out of misbehavin' spendin' all of your pay on wine women and song
Well I'm a makin' bed you're out a makin' time
You robbed my piggy bank and spent my last thin dime on wine woman and song
Well one of these nights you gonna come home you find it's comin' home to you
You see what you've done and what's good for one it's also good for two
When you in the doghouse with the mingy ole pup
You may start to thinkin' and a givin' up your wine women and song
[ piano ]
Well one of these nights...

// End Of The World //

Why does the sun go on shining why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world cause you don't love me anymore
Why do the birds go on singing why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand no I can't understand why life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye
[ piano ]
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye

// My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You //

I may say that I don't care hold up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
[ guitar - piano ]
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter how I cry
And my arms keep reaching...

// Fool No. 1 //

Am I fool number one or am I fool number two
How many other girls have been fooled by you
I suppose that the number is far from being small
But I'll bet that I'm the biggest fool of all

If I had the chance I guess I'd do it all again
I'd go down that same old road even knowing at the end
You'd leave me when your heart hears a new love call
So I guess that I'm the biggest fool of all
[ piano ]
Am I fool number one...

// This Haunted House //

I watched you leave that's how I know you're gone
But this heart of mine keeps telling me I'm wrong
I see your face before me every night
In this haunted house when I turn off the light
Sometimes I hear you walk across the floor
And my arms reach out to hold you like before
I live for all the things we used to do
In this haunted house I filled with love for you
This haunted house I'm living in is killing me
And the ghost of your love won't set me free
Each morning finds me crying and alone
In this haunted house we used to call our home
Each morning finds me crying...

// Get Set For A Heartache //

It wasn't very long ago that he held me so close
But the little love he had has died for me who loved him most
He left me for another and didn't say goodbye
And if you're next to love him then you'll be next to cry
Get set for a heartache that's all I can say get set for a heartache on its way
[ fiddle - steel ]
He'll make you think he loves you too but you'll find it's not true
You'll learn that when you need him most he'll be with someone new
Your love will all be wasted that's how it was with me
And soon heartaches will tell you you're just his used to be
Get set for a heartache that's all I can say get set for a heartache on its way
