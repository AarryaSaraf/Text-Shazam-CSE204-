// Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town //

Oh you better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm a tellin' you why Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's a makin' a list he's a checkin' in twice gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin' he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out...
[ guitar ]
Oh you better watch out...
He's a makin' a list he's a checkin' in twice...
Santa Claus is a comin' to town

// Silver Bells //

Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day

City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells silver bells...
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells) silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day

// It Won't Seem Like Christmas //

Everybody's busy decorating Christmas trees
And outside icicles hanging from the eaves
And the snowlakes are flyin' just as far as I can see
But it won't seem like Christmas to me
No it won't seem like Christmas you'll be there and I'll be here
So I'll decorate a heartache with my tears
So have a merry merry Christmas wherever you may be
Oh but it won't seem like Christmas to me
[ guitar ]
No it won't seem like Christmas what Christmas without you
I'll be lonely but my darling I'll be true
So have a merry merry Christmas...
No it won't seem like Christmas to me

// Christmas Without Daddy //

Christmas Day is getting closer but there's sadness mixed with joy
Every day a few more questions from our little girl and boy
Not alone but there'll be lonely for their daddy won't be here
And just like the air at Christmas there'll be a chill upon the chill
Christmas without daddy will be such a lonesome day
We'll send a prayer and all our love to you so far away
Your son just wrote to Santa asked him to send you home
Yes Christmas without daddy we'll be blue and all alone
[ steel ]
Christmas without daddy I don't know what we're gonna do
On the present from your baby she wrote daddy I love you
Your son just wrote to Santa asked him to send you home
Yes Christmas without daddy we'll be blue and all alone

// I Won't Decorate Your Christmas Tree //

Well I wrote to Santa just today I told him I don't plan to stay
Cause you've been bad yes you've been treatin' me wrong
So listen to me here's Christmas cheers because you won't be with me here
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year
You can stay out there to toast and cheer with all of your friends
Don't hang on me a bein' here when you come back again
Your bags are burnt out and your fancy don't shine I just won't be a waitin' this time
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year
[ guitar ]
Well I won't be here this Christmas Day I wouldn't give a present anyway
But have a good time and be concerned about me
I'm going back to my mom and dad they love me more than you ever had
I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year
You can stay out there...
No I won't decorate your Christmas tree this year

// Gift Of The Blues //

I hope you had a very very merry and that your seasons wishes came true
But mine will of white the contrary for I recieved a gift of the blues
I travel miles and miles to see my baby all this way just to share his charms
Travel miles and miles to find my baby wrapped up so neatly in someone else's arms
I hope you had a cool and a franic we laugh at resolutions were few
But there are those of us near panic were the ones who got a gift of the blues
I travel miles and miles to find my baby all this way just to share his charms
Travel miles and miles to find my baby wrapped up so neatly in someone else's arms
I hope you had a very very merry and that your seasons wishes came true
But mine will of white the contrary for I recieved a gift of the blues
