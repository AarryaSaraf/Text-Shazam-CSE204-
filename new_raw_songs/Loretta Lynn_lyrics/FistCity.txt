// Jackson Ain't A Very Big Town //

Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walkin' I count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town
[ steel ]
Jackson is a mighty small town...

// You Didn't Like My Lovin' //

Don't you think it's a little too late to show those tears
Just look out the way you're treatin' me all these years
I'm a full grown woman but you're treatin' me like a kid
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
And the one I found really made me flip my lid
After all that past I'm learnin' to live at last
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
[ steel - dobro ]
Far as I'm concerned you can turn and walk out that door
Cause the way we'd made it don't make it with me no more
Where your head used to lay there's another head there instead
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
You didn't like my lovin'...
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did

// I've Got Texas In My Heart //

I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather
I crave the smell of good ole saddle leather I've got Texas in my heart
I've got a lotta friends in Amarrilo I like Dallas Forth Worth Houston San Antone
Got a pinin' in my heart to be in Texas I've said I'll wind up makin' it my home
I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces
The Lone Star State has won my heart doggone it
And long horn steak with lots of ketchup on it I've got Texas in my heart
[ banjo ]
I love the western way they grab in Texas where that Lone Star hat is mighty plain
You can bet your boots and saddle I love Texas gonna hang and to go back there again
I'm packin' up my old suitcases to go see old familiar faces
Give me blue skies and sunny Texas weather
I crave the smell of good old saddle leather I've got Texas in my heart
(The eyes of Texas are upon you) I've got Texas in my heart

// You Never Were Mine //

It's late almost morning you just walk in the door
Don't bother explaining I've heard it all before
Just turn around and leave me I've made up my mind
That I'll never lose you for you never were mine
I'll hurt if you leave me but I'll hurt if you'd stay
My heart knows no difference it would break either way
They all say I've lost you but someday they'll find
That I didn't lose you for you never were mine
I can't say that's over it never did start guess I lose my mind after losin' my heart
Oh no I'm not cryin' I've had too much wine
How can I lose you when you never were mine
Oh no I'm not cryin'...

// Somebody's Back In Town //

I just heard the saddest news somebody's back in town
And I know just what she's gonna do
She'll pick up what she left off her last time around
Oh how it hurts to keep on losin' you
Somebody's back in town to steal your love from me
The fear I've had so long is now reality
The only chance I have is when she throws you down
My chance is gone somebody's back in town
[ steel ]
I know that I can't change your way we've been through that before
Her trap is set and you will walk right in
She only wants of love an up-affair and nothing more
And you're just fool enough to fall again
Somebody's back in town why can't she stay away
You should know she never loved you anyway
She'll let you live a little then she'll throw you down
Sad news today somebody's back in town

// Satisfied Mind //

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was winning in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened I lost every dime but I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
[ steel ]
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a proper at time compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When life has ended and time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

// How Long Will It Take //

(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me
I keep a waitin' and a wonderin' how long will it take
Well you keep a tellin' me your love I'm winnin'
Then you turn right around and you treat me hard and cold
Well I ain't got but one life here I'm livin'
So if you're gonna love me baby I've gotta know
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you want me
How much longer has this old heart gotta break
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me
I keep a waitin' and a wonderin' how long will it take
[ steel ]
Now there ain't a thing on earth that don't need a lovin'
And baby I'm no exception to the rule
But if you keep a puttin' everything above me
Well how in this world will I ever get through to you
(How long will it take...

// I Don't Wanna Play House //

Today I sat alone at the window and I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But somethin' didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't wanna play house I know it can't be fun
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye
I don't wanna play house...

// I'm Shootin' For Tomorrow //

It's a breakin' day and here you come with eyes as red as far
You tell me that you've done nothin' and you don't know how right you are
With the little home chores you used to do and they've all gone to pot
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
After all I'm gonna take and honey that's a lot
Well you used to think you's the only man but I found out you're not
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
[ dobro ]
I used to keep the home from burnin' but I let 'em all go out
So don't hand me that ---
Now this old house is a gettin' cold and I'm a goin' where the climate's hot
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow...
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot

// What Kind Of A Girl (Do You Think I Am) //

You want me to prove my love for you
I'm surprised that's the way you're askin' me to
You've known me so long I can't understand what kind of a girl do you think I am
What kind of a girl do you want for a wife
Do you want a girl who knows that much about life
Well if that's what you want take me out of your plans
What kind of a girl do you think I am
[ steel ]
What kind of a girl would do the things you're askin' me to without wedding rings
Is it what you must do to prove you're a man what kind of a girl do you think I am
What kind of a girl...
