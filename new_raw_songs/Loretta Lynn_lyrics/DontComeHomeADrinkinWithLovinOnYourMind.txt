// Don't Come Home A Drinkin' (With Lovin' On Your Mind) //

Well you thought I'd be waitin' up when you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys and you ended up half tight
But liquor and love that just don't mix leave a bottle or me behind
And don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find
Cause if you want that kind of love well you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
[ steel - guitar ]
You never take me anywhere because you're always gone
Many a night I've laid awake and cried dear all alone
And you come in a kissin' on me it happens every time
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin'...
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

// I Really Don't Want To Know //

How many arms have held you and hated to let you go
How many how many I wonder no I really don't want to know
How many lips have kissed you and set your heart aglow
How many how many I wonder but I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder always make me guess
And even if I ask you oh darling don't confess
Just let it remain your secret cause darling I love you so
No wonder no wonder I wonder no I really don't want to know
No I really don't want to know

// Tomorrow Never Comes //

Now you tell me that you love me yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married but tomorrow is never there
No tomorrow never comes no tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me but tomorrow never comes
[ guitar ]
Many weeks now I have waited many long nights I have cried
Just to see that happy morning when I'd have you by my side
But tomorrow never comes...

// There Goes My Everything //

I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possesion there goes my everything

As my memory turns back the pages I can see the happy years we had before
And the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living...

// Shoe Goes On The Other Foot Tonight //

How long did you think you could go on hurtin' me
And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone
Well you go out and have your fun like you are free
Tonight I'll have some pleasures of my own
Cause a shoe goes on the other foot tonight
We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
Cause a shoe goes on the other foot tonight
[ steel - dobro ]
Each time you walk out the door you walk on me
And you leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you are free
You must think there's wings upon your shoes
But a shoe goes on...
Yes a shoe goes on the other foot tonight

// Saint To A Sinner //

You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad
But while you were busy with business and booze
I lost the wings and the halo I had
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you can't blame me for it all
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you don't know how it hurt me to fall
[ piano - steel ]
You didn't think that your angel could wander but I'm just like you flesh and blood
While you had your drinkin' your buddies and business
I guess I had too much time all alone
You say I went...

// Devil Gets His Dues //

Well you think you're the hardest thing a goin'
The way things come to you you think you're in
But one of these days that wind's a gonna start blowin'
You may not lose the big boy you won't win
Cause the devil gets his dues and you'll start payin'
When he collects you know you'll pay your debt
The devil gets his dues like I been sayin'
You hurt just like you've hurt me you can bet
[ guitar ]
When it comes to love you wear the devil's menu
And you bribe a lot that you just can't be hurt
You're not the only one who knows the trick or two
Some day I might rub your face in the dirt
Well your little play house is sittin' on sticks of dynamite
And I get mad tonight and light the fuze
If you come in and find out that my dog bites
You'll know the devil's here collectin' dues
Cause the devil gets his dues...

// I Can't Keep Away From You //

By your side each minute's where I wanna be
Can't get you off my mind and let it rest in peace
So every step you make I wanna make it too oh I can't keep away from you
Well I don't care where you are as long as you're with me
You're every dream I dream you're every breath I breathe
My shadow follows you loves everything you do why I can't keep away from you
Oh I can't keep away from you I couldn't if I wanted to
No matter how hard I try or what I do
You've got my heart and soul that's why I need you so
You're holding on to me I know I can't let go
But all what I go through to prove my love is true oh I can't keep away from you
[ steel ]
Baby I can't keep away from you

// I'm Living In Two Worlds //

I'm living in two worlds dividing my time
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine

When I'm in your world I just pretend that I'm really happy though I don't fit in
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone I'm living in two worlds where do I belong
I'm living in two worlds...
[ piano ]
Old friends in your world are new friends to me
So I can't take part in your old memories
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same
We both have our own worlds and neither can change
I'm living in two worlds...

// Get What'cha Got And Go //

A pretty boy Charlie's the name that you've been a given
And you act like the whole wide world all you were livin'
You tell me you can get any girl you know
You say it got what it takes to me you're just a heartache
So get what'cha got and go
You think you're the greatest thing in this whole town
Oh number one but everyone no one can put you down
Every night you go downtown where the go-gos go
Oh well you think you're so hot and you tell me you're not
So get what'cha got and go
[ steel ]
You better watch that sneaky smile right off of your face
For I just might to knock it off and put it in your place
Just like the wild wild wind all you do is blow
Just say I'm holdin' you back but baby I'll have to pack
So get what'cha got and go
You think you're the greatest thing...

// Making Plans //

You say tomorrow you're going it's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling like a tree that shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the teardrops cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome cause you're making plans to leave
[ steel ]
Yes you're making plans to leave

// I Got Caught //

You're standin' there a sayin' I'm no good and I'm so ashamed I'd die if I could
But you're no better than I am or have you given this one thought
The only thing that's different I got caught
Over night you left me all alone and the only arms close to me was my own
And now you're blame on me but it's not all my fault
The only thing that's different I got caught
Yeah I got caught but honey you're a pro
There's not a thing about cheatin' you don't know
That same old line you sell is the same old line I bought
The thing you've got away with I got caught
[ guitar - steel ]
Yeah I got caught...
Yeah the thing you've got away with I got caught
