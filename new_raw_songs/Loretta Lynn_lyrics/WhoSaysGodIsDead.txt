Album: WhoSaysGodIsDead

// Who Says God Is Dead //

(Who says God is dead who says God is dead)
Who says God is dead I'm a talkin' to him now
Who says God is dead he's with us all right now
He knows every move that you make he knows every time you make a mistake
The rumor has been spread who says God is dead
Who says God is dead that's stooped and mighty low
I like to meet 'em face to face and tell 'em it's not so
I've got my Saviour by the hand he's leadin' me to the Promised Land
No I'm not out of my head who says God is dead
[ guitar ]
Who says God is dead he's a watchin' you right now
Who says God is dead he's a reachin' for you now
If I were you I'd kneel and pray cause we're not promised one more day
Remember blood was shed who says God is dead
Who says God is dead...
Who says God is dead who says God is dead who says God is dead

// I Believe //

I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows
I believe for every one who goes astray someone will come to show the way
I believe I believe
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
(I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word)
Every time I hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe I believe

// Standing Room Only //

Standing room only not even room to kneel and pray
Standing room only on the Judgement Day
Last night I have an awful dream that the end of time had come
The trumpet had been sounded and life on earth has done
An angel stood one foot on land the other foot on sea
And as I tried to kneel and pray a voice said unto me
There's standing room only it's too late now to pray
There's standing room only this is the Judgement Day
People filled each church and churchyard just as far as I could see
I heard the pitiful cry for mercy and then I realized it was me
I saw the Saviour then appear as he split the eastern sky
I saw tears of joy on a Christian's face and I heard the sinners cry
And as I tried to touch his hand with one last people plea
I cried again have mercy have mercy Lord on me
I saw a tear come to his eye as he turned my soul away
I didn't know him yesterday and he knew me not today
The earth was burning all around the world wound up in smoke
And as the flames engulfed me thank God I awoke
Then I got out of bed and got down on my knees and you should've heard me pray
For in my dream I witnessed God's great Judgement Day
Standing room only on God's great Judgement Day

// Old Rugged Cross //

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
[ piano ]
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross...

// Harp With Golden Strings //

I love to hear those good old songs they sing unto the Lord
I love to play my old guitar with them and I wanna choir
I'm looking forward to the day when I'll reach glory land
I'll have a harp with golden strings to play with the angel band
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings
I'm gonna play like David did unto my Lord and pain
We'll gather round the great white throne and make the heaven's ring
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings
[ ac.guitar ]
I hear songs of every time that gives my heart a trill
Songs of love and happiness and songs about the hills
But of all the songs I've ever heard there's none that can compare
To the songs that helps the angels sing when I get over there
I'm gonna trade my old guitar...
I'm gonna trade my old guitar for a harp with golden strings

// If You Miss Heaven (You'll Miss It All) //

If you're tired of sinnin' take your Saviour's hand
There's a mansion worth winnin' in the great Promised Land
Many debtors are grinnin' don't you slip and fall if you miss heaven you'll miss it all
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all for me to reach heaven I'd gladly crawl
The smallest and weakest who love him or toss if you miss heaven you'll miss it all
[ steel ]
Our loving Saviour gave us a sake of birth
And his salvation frees us from the sorrows of earth
Forever with Jesus may life seem so small if you miss heaven you'll miss it all
If you miss heaven...

// I'm A Getting Ready To Go //

I get down on my knees everyday and I pray
These tears I'm a cryin' are tears of joy cause it wash my sins away
I'm a livin' for the Lord and I want everybody to know
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go
Yeah I'm a gettin' ready to go to a place called heaven
I'm gonna praise my Saviour's name everyday that I'm livin'
Glory hallelujah I'm not ashamed to let the salvation show
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go
[ piano ]
I'm gonna walkin' there with Jesus and my God
I wanna know everything'sa gonna be alright when they lay me under to sod
When he gathers his sheep I wanna be as white as snow
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go
Yeah I'm a gettin' ready to go...
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go

// In The Garden //

I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
[ guitar ]
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me...

// Ten Thousand Angels //

He could have caught ten thousand angels

They bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he pray
They led him through the street in shame
They spat upon the Savior so pure and free from sin
They said crucify him he's to blame
He could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free
He could have called ten thousand angels but he died alone for you and me

Upon his precious head they placed a crown of thorns
They laughed and said behold the king
They struck him and they cursed him and mocked his holy name
And all alone he suffered everything
He could have caught

// He's Got The Whole World In His Hands //

He's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole wide world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands

He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got the little bitty baby in his hands
He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands...

He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got you and me sister in his hands
He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands...

He's got everybody here in his hands he's got everybody here in his hands
He's got everybody here in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands...
He's got the whole world in his hands...

// Mama Why //

(Oh mama why did God take my daddy cause I'd been good just like he said to be
I heard daddy pray dear Lord don't take me from them
Oh mama why did God take him from me)
Come here son you've asked mama somethin' that's even hard for me to understand
For there's one thing I do know
Daddy wouldn't gonna see those tears in the eyes of this big man
So stop cryin' now and listen real careful to every word mama has to say
You see son God picks the sweetest most beautiful flowers that grow
And he makes them the brightest shiniest stars that glow
Now daddy talk with the Lord every day and daddy and God'll be real close
So let's just say it seems that God takes the ones he loves the most
(Oh mama why did God take my daddy)
Son you haven't heard a word that mama said
So come on now let's say your prayers and mama tuck you in bed
And we must have questioned God cause he already has everything planned
And honey daddy can't ever come back to us though we can go to him
(Oh mama why did God take him from me)
