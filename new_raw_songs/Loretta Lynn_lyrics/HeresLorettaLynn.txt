// Blue Steel //

Well I was feelin' mighty lonesome through my tears I could hardly see
When the flashin' lights of the honky tonk was inviting me
Oh well I sat down at my table with my head in my hand
And I watched him dance so close to her to the honky tonk band

It was then I heard the fiddle play the guitar it played too
And that old steel guitar it cried and it kept on playin' the blues

Oh well I ordered up just one more drink I thought would ease my mind
But I found out it didn't help for a love sick heart that's blind
Old memories keep comin' back old memories of you
And all the time that you once said that no one else would do

It was then I heard the fiddle play the guitar it played too
And that old steel guitar it cried and it kept on playin' the blues

// New Rainbow //

There's a new rainbow in the sky
I can see the starlight in your eyes
Those love beams shine from cupid's bow
I'm in love with you I know

I've been searchin' all around to find someone like you
And now I'm gonna settle down I've found someone that's true
That rainbow will never fade away
For I know our love is here to stay

You put a rainbow in my heart
I know you won't tear it apart
And if you say you love me too
Then our dreams will all come true

I've been searchin' all around to find someone like you
And now I'm gonna settle down I've found someone that's true
That rainbow will never fade away
For I know our love is here to stay

// Stop //

Stop you're foolin' me oh stop and let me be
I can't understand a love that's second hand
When it's on true and just like driftin' sand

Stop danger's in sight oh stop it's just not right
To break a heart like mine and then leave me behind
Oh please stop cause you know I'm not your kind

Why do you want to do me this a way
When you have yourself a new girl every day

Oh please stop danger's ahead oh stop just like you've led
Someday you will see just what you've done to me
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry

Stop you're foolin' me oh stop and let me be
I can't understand a love that's second hand
When it's on true and just like driftin' sand

Stop danger's in sight oh stop it's just not right
To break a heart like mine and then leave me behind
Oh please stop cause you know I'm not your kind

Why do you want to do me this a way
When you have yourself a new girl every day

Oh please stop danger's ahead oh stop just like you've led
Someday you will see just what you've done to me
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry

// Heartaches Meet Mr. Blues //

Well here I am with my head bowed low my tears they're rolling down
My baby's with somebody new in a honky tonk in town

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues

When my baby left this mornin' said he wouldn't be home no more
I can hear still hear the echo of him a slammin' my back door

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues

// The Darkest Day //

Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Darlin' when you told me you were leavin'
I thought that you were only foolin' me
But here I am to face old blue tomorrow
With a broken heart that's filled with misery

It seems that my world is to an end
Just dreamin' of things that could have been
Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Oh how I wished that ole sayin' is true
It's always darkest just before dawn
And only God in heaven knows my heart is achin'
And only you can keep this heart of mine from breakin'

It seems that my world is to an end
Just dreamin' of things that could have been
Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

// My Life Story //

Here's the story of my life so listen and I'll tell it nice
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey
Well I was born in old Kentucky in them hills where folks are lucky
And it's paradise to me

Well the hogs are gruntin' and the roosters' a crowin'
Way back here in parts unknowin'
Pa's a milkin' and maw's a sweepin'
Brothers stand and you're asleep just too lazy to move

The kids are yellin' maw's got leven a way back here in paradise heaven
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey
The banjo's a goin' and so is the fiddle I think I'll just do a little
Of that ole hillbilly hoedown

Well I got a feller right over the hill
If he asks me to marry well I know I will
He asked me to marry got kissed before
And I'm tellin' you I don't want no more
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey

Well I got a feller right over the hill
If he asks me to marry well I know I will
He asked me to marry got kissed before
And I'm tellin' you I don't want no more
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey

// Gonna Pack My Troubles //

I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump'em in the deep blue sea
Come all your lovers from misery lane and a tag along with me
Well I'm tired of livin' this kind of life wantin' things that just can't be
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea

Well then that ole sun it'll start to shine and I won't be blue no more
Well then I'll find myself a brand new love that's a what I'm longin' for
Well the loves I had they've made me sad left my heart swingin' from a tree
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea

Well then that ole sun it'll start to shine and I won't be blue no more
Well then I'll find myself a brand new love that's a what I'm longin' for
Well the loves I had they've made me sad left my heart swingin' from a tree
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea
And dump them in the deep blue sea
