Album: YouAintWomanEnough

// Put It Off Until Tomorrow //

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're goin' away but leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today

// These Boots Are Made For Walkin' //

You keep a sayin' you got something for me something you call love but confess yes
You've been a messin' where you shouldn't been a messin'
And now someone else is a gettin' all your best
These boots are made for walkin' and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lyin' when you ought to be true then
And you keep loosin' when you ought enough bad
You keep a samin' when you oughta be a changin'
The what's right is right and you ain't been right yet
These boots are made for walkin'...

You keep a playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep a thinkin' that you'll never get burned
I've just found me a brand new box of matches yeah
And what he knows you ain't that time to learn
These boots are made for walkin'...
Come on boots let's walk all over

// God Gave Me A Heart To Forgive //

It's midnight now and I'm still all alone
It's always late each night when you come home
I stay and take each heartache that you give cause God gave me a heart to forgive
Yes I could call these tears my closest friends
They stay with me till you come home again
You brought me every mis'ry that there is but God gave me a heart to forgive
You hurt me as much as you can
Then you tell me that you're just weak like any other man
Still you're the only reason that I live and God gave me a heart to forgive

You hurt me as much as you can...

// Keep Your Change //

You need a change of scenery that's all I ever heard
And when you left and you said goodbye I never said a word
You're back but I don't want you back to you that might seem strange
But I ain't find what she bought so honey keep your change
Yeah honey keep your change and the trouble that she brings
You've worked real hard for what you got so honey keep your change

What happened to the scenery that look so good to you
Did you get hard of the change you made or did she get hard of you
You're like a travelin' salesman and I hear they're all the same
So travel right on back to her yeah honey keep your change
Yeah honey keep your change...
Yeah honey keep your change...
Yeah honey keep your change yeah honey keep your change

// Someone Before Me //

Someone before me still turns you inside out
When we're together she's all you talk about
You're always wanting me to do the things she used to do
Someone before me sure left her mark on you
I've tried to get inside your heart but I don't have a chance
Now I can see she's on your mind with every little glance
You're living on old mem'ries my love can't get through to you
Someone before me sure left her mark on you

I've tried to get inside your heart...

// Tippy Toeing //

Well mama go a tippy tippy toein' through the house
Gotta see what's the matter with the baby
It's been a bawlin' and a squallin' and a kickin' on the wall
Well I guess it's dropped its little bottle maybe
Oh daddy come a runnin' with the water and a rag
Gonna need another little diaper maybe
No need a hesitatin' or a wonderin' and a waitin' I know what's the matter with baby
Oh mama rock a baby daddy rock a baby too
It's a yawnin' and a gettin' sleepy maybe
So mama keep a rockin' daddy rock a little too and at last it's a sleepin' little baby

Well mama tippy toein' daddy tippy toein' too gonna try to do a little sleepin' maybe
Whether it'll be a minute or an hour or two is depending entirely on the baby
Well I hear the clock a ringin' just a dongin' and a dingin'
Daddy go and make a little money maybe
Mama sleep a little longer but remember while he's gone
Won't you please take care of the baby
Oh mama rock a baby...
And at last it's a sleepin' little baby after all it's a sleepin' little baby
After all it's a sleepin' little baby after all it's a sleepin' little baby

// Talking To The Wall //

Oh I might as well be talking to the wall
I've known so long with me you've been unsatisfied
So I finally found the strenght to say goodbye
Why already I forgot a million memories and leaving you was easy as could be
But I might as well be talking to the wall when I tell myself I'm not missin' you at all
Cause every time you come around I fall and I might as well be talking to the wall

It seems there's not a day that some friends of mine
Don't bring back the mem'ries I'll recall
But I smile and say you know it's been a long long time
And I hardly remember him at all
But I might as well be...
Yes I might as well be talking to the wall

// Man I Hardly Know //

In a booth back in a corner where the lights are way down low
In the arms of a man I hardly know

I let the devil take over this heart of mine
When I lost your love well I almost lost my mind
I never thought I'd ever fall this low but here I am with a man I hardly know
In a booth back in a corner...

I do the things a proper lady wouldn't do
And it all started that first night when I lost you
To see me now you wouldn't know me I'm changed so
Cause here I am with a man I hardly know
In a booth back in a corner...

// Is It Wrong (For Loving You) //

Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true
Tell me darling tell me please is it wrong
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you

Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart
Yes the only true love I ever knew
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you

Is it wrong for loving you..

// It's Another World //

It's another world when I'm with you
Roses everywhere blue skies up above everybody is in love
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be
Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with you
It's another world when I'm with you
Nights are made for love days are never long nothing nothing can go wrong
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be

Never a day goes by when I'm blue there's no tears in my eyes when I'm with you
It's another world when I'm with you
And it's here right now let me hold you close love you know just grows and grows
It's another world when I'm with you and that's where I wanna be
