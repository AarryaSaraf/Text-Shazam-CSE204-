// Ball For The Coach //

Big house, fast car, baby, you'll go so far
But not me
High wage, no kid, baby, you're free
But not me
Let a climate who's designing your heart
These days

Clown face, drag race, sleep alone in silk sheets
With no peace

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach

Fat check, white lace, baby, you're a disgrace
But not me
Bye, bye, sell, sell, winding up in hell
Don't come free
Doesn't matter, bug fat platter
Vacation retreat

Clown face, drag race, sleep alone in silk sheets
With no peace

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach

// Change The World //

If I could reach the stars
I'd pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
That I can
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom that we had made
'Til then I'll be a fool
Wishing for a day
That I can
Change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could
Change the world

Build me a brand new heart
Toss me a brand new start

Just let me come out and play

China

Watch every step I take
When I'm back late from break
I can behave
Just let me come out and play

// Cowboy Shit //

A dusty old bear and cowboy boots
Snakeskin in the wind
A tumbleweed rolling down the road tonight
A storm cloud's coming in
Tired old horse lays down it's head
Soon it'll begin

Dream about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
Dream about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit

The sheriff sits back and shines his badge
What a dirty old pig he is
The navaho chief sheds a tear
Instead of flipping lips
A dusty old horse picks up its head
Soon it'll begin

I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
Uh
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit

// Enter Sandman //

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep (Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

// Father Of The Year //

When the lights come on, take the alley?
There's no driving drunk in the Valley
Sweet heart know
I'll be back around in a few years
Try some other town, sink a few beers
Sweet heart know

I'm the father of the year

Everything I've said has been bullshit
Went and settled down with some new kids
Sweet heart know
Shrug it off and make sure your tune's up
On a street with dimes and your tink up
Sweet heart know

I'm the father of the year

// Fooled By Love //

I told her that I loved her
A little early on
There's no use left in crying
Honey, I've been fooled by love, this way before

There's no more conversation
No knocking at her door
There's no use in denying
Baby, I've been fooled by love, this way before

Why am I still crying?
There's no use left in crying
But I'm still out here crying
When I've been fooled by love before

No more early mornings
Waking up alone
And though it feels like dying
Honey, I've been fooled by love, this way before

I told her that I loved her
But what's it even for?
What's the use in crying?
Baby, I've been fooled by love, this way before

Why am I still crying?
There's no use left in crying
But I'm still out here crying
When I've been fooled by love before

// Goodnight Baby //

Goodnight, baby
Lick the blood from the blade
Place the rose on the grave
Goodnight, baby
Baby, goodnight

Goodnight, brother
Wash the blood from the hands
Toss the gloves in garbage cans
Goodnight, brother
Brother, goodnight
Goodnight, brother
Brother, goodnight

Goodnight, mama
Hide the axe in the shed
Tuck the body in the bed
Goodnight, mama
Mama, goodnight

Goodnight, papa
Ditch the skin, keep the bones
Sitting there, on his throne
Goodnight, papa
Papa, goodnight
Goodnight, papa
Papa, goodnight

// I Like Her //

I'd give the world to her
As long as my heart still beating
As long as she's next to me
As long as this love still fleeting

Because I like her

I'd kill in cold blood
I'd draw my own blood
Long as she's there beside me
Life could feel so good

Because I like her

Could it be make believe?
Am I just walking through a dream?
Haven't felt this way in
Such a long time, I do believe

That I like her

// Inside The Beavers Dam //

Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver has a metal
The metal has a trophy
A trophy is for bowling
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
Somewhere, there's a chair
The beaver's sitting there
Looking at that trophy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver's wife is grumpy
Because the beaver's lazy
But still loves him like crazy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver's baby is crying
The beaver's wife is sighing
But man, look at that trophy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam

// Is It Boy (Demo) //

Exercise to stay alive
Another year has gone and passed you by
Waking up to coffee cup
Stretch it off, rip it up

When the old man gets to see it
He'll be whistling
All his worries away
And I know just how you see them
Keep believin'
That you'll find your foot someday

But you won't, will you boy
But no you won't, will you boy
It's not what you want, is it boy
It's not what you want

Exercise another way
To live your life, some other day ahead
Sleepin' in the day begins
You decide to rise up from your bed

When the old man gets to see it
Understand that all his dreamin' days are gone
And I hope now that you'll feel it
Your belief in all this nonsense is done

But it's not, is it boy
No it's not, is it boy
So take what you've got, can't you boy
Take what you've got

// No Doubt About It //

It's not as though I choose my love
If I win or lose in love
Sharing one last dance with you is enough
It's not as though I tell my heart
If it can or can't be bought
Of path in love that it'll choose

It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You

It's sad to see your heart divided
Little use in trying to hide it
Sharing one last dance with you has proved
It's not as though I understand
Another day, a new demand
On the path of love, a heart will choose

It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You
It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You

// No Sunny Days (Demo) //

Talk about a total change of pace
Another day, another lonely face
Another town to kick your boots around in
Never time to learn a single phrase

Suddenly you're home and through your door
It's not the best, but best you can't afford
Wave and kiss goodbye to feeling lonely
A week or two at home and you'll want more

There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away

Talk about a total change of heart
Handed out and fully ripped apart
Cheers to you for never breaking down
So surprised you ever came this far

Once you're home and settled in your bed
Don't act as though you've simply been misled
Let her know you love her if you do, boy
Let her know what's on the road ahead

There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away
There's no sunny days in outer space
And truthfully told
I'd have it no other way

// On The Yangtze //

Take a swim just you and me
On the yangtze
Take a dip try a sip
Of the yangtze

Havin' fun out in the sun
On the yangtze
Chores are done nowhere to run
On the yangtze

And so we see a captain
Skimmin' down the shoreline
He asks if we're chilly
And we tell him, cap' we're just fine

Dippin' in its love again
On the yangtze
Swimmin' down we're passin' towns
On the yangtze

Crystal clear the hills are here
On the yangtze
Dippin' in it's love again
On the yangtze

And so we see a young girl
Standin' at the shoreline
She asks if we're happy
And I tell her girl, we're havin' a great time

// Proud True Toyota //

Six feet, with the brown seats and the power windows
Light brown with a hundred thousand on the rodeo
Drunk space, now my new case come wherever I go
New wheels, waterproof seals at the wash and blow

Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota

Topped up in my new truck and we're hitting the road
Break down, not a chance to, not in this Toyo'
Night drive with the moon up at the passenger door
Drive a couple thousand then a thousand more

Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota

Toyota

// Round Here //

Let that happy head down
You can relax round here
I closed all my doors
You can kick back round here
Round here

It's in the past
Man, time moves fast round here
Come settle down
No need to frown round here
Round here

// Scarecrow //

Scarecrow
What you stand for?
Could I be cold?
What do they know
About it?
Scarecrow
Do you feel alone?
Could I be cold?
What do they know
About it?

Scared crow
Where'd your heart go?
Could I be cold?
Now they all know
About it
Scared crow
Soon you'll be alone
Could I be cold
Now they all know
About it

// She Get The Gold Star //

She get the gold star
The keys to my new car
The deed to my heart
Right from the start of it
Oh, how our love grove
Best one that I've known
But since you've been gone
I can't go on with it

But tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go

She get the set up
She got me messed up
I give her my heart
She can take all of it
How much does love know
Of how much our love grows?
Just one day more
Till we get back to it

But tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go
Tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go

Ooh
Ya, ya
Cool, it's cool
It's cool

// She Want The Sandwich //

She want the sandwich, baby
She want the sandwich, baby
Lettuce and tomato, baby
With mayo on a roll, I'll go anywhere she goes

I'll get the sandwich, baby
I'll get the sandwich, baby
Lettuce and tomato, baby
I love her but I don't think she even knows

Oh

For a moment
I could see you
In my mind
Fuckin' lookin'
Like maybe
Tonight's the night
Everybody
Standin' out
Admiring your style
Baby could I be the Corona
To your lime

My muthafuckin' baby

// Stratocaster //

Stratocastor
Played me that one you used to play
Doesn't matter
My heart belongs to yesterday

Just
Me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon

Live below no master
And all of your troubles blow away
Hold my stratocastor
Play me that one we used to play

Just
Me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon

// The Truth //

She taught me to see it all
For what it is now
Made me believe in love again
Boy, it's been years now
But debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go, leave her alone
And keep my heart from the truth
The truth

She saw me how I believed
Nobody could now
I'm so relieved, or so it seems
Everything's clear now
The debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go reap what I've sewn
And keep my heart from the truth
The truth

// Trouble Believing (Demo) //

(One two three four)
Trouble believing
What's been going on
Find yourself a new home
Who knows for how long

Is it wrong to feel afraid
Of things that don't affect you know
But surely will someday?
Is it wrong to try to change
The style of your conversation
Just to get your way

These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in

Trouble believing
Anything you're told
Nothing is much easier
Only that you've grown

Getting harder now to tell
What's right from wrong by yourself
Getting harder now to see
No one ever understands just what you need

These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in
These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in

(Nipples)

// Turn My TV On //

Now she's gone
I'll turn my TB on
I should mow my lawn (No)
I'll turn my TV on
Write another song (No)
I'll turn my TV on
Hope it isn't long
Till I turn my TV on

So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV

All my tears are gone
When I turn my TV on
Nothing's ever wrong
When I turn my TV on
I should call my mom (Not today)
I'll turn my TV on
Hope it isn't long
Till I turn my TV on

So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV
So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV

// You Made The Bed //

How you supposed to love her
When you can't look in the mirror?
Another empty bottle
Don't make anything clearer

You made the bed
Sleep, boy

Thought you said you'd call him
But his phone hasn't been ringin'
Thought it was your problem
It turns out you were just singin'

You made the bed
Sleep, boy
You made the bed
Sleep, boy
