// Eyes On Me //

Thought she'd be coming back home, tomorrow
She wrote a note that she won't be
All of my tears have been borrowed
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

Think I'd tell her that I loved her, tomorrow
Hope that she sees things the same way that I see
I learnt to swim through my sorrows
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
(Yeah)
I only cry, cry cry little baby, cry
(Cry when I know that your eyes are on me, mother fucker)
(Yeah)

// Powers Back On //

One, Two, Three

All the love

(I'm back)

All the lovely people

All the lovely people, love people

(Cool)

// Out Of My Head //

(Be quiet)
Check, yeah, uhhuh
Whatever
(One, Two, Three)
Yep

Drove out of town, just to see some stars
Out of my head, over how things are

Out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
Like out of my car

Drove to the church, my time to confess
Jesus was there, she looked really pissed

Out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
What a fucking mess

// Seeing Red //

(One, Two Three)

The blood's on your hands
Your heart's in your mouth
Chew and spit out
Baby

It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, oh, oh
You've been seeing red

The gun's in your mouth
Finger on the the trigger
Which man turns out victor?
Baby

It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
No need to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, oh, oh
You've been seeing red

// New You //

Oh no
Just as things got better
Trouble comes along
To sing it's favorite song
And it sounds alright
A tune that you remember
So sing a bar or two
And wave goodbye to the new you
