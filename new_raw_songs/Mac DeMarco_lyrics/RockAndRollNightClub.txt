// Rock And Roll Night Club //

Cruising in the Moonlight, heading downtown
Looking for some fast love, gotta get down
Boogie Woogie woman looking my way
So, if you want a good time you know just where I stay

At the Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club

Meet me on the dance floor, let me shake my stuff
Know you aren't just players in the rock and roll game
Boogie Woogie woman join me for a dance
So if you want a good time, girl you know my plans

At the Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club

Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club, Rock and Roll Night Club

// Baby's Wearing Blue Jeans //

Standing on the corner, trying to keep it clean
A fine lookin' woman, in a pair of Lees
Take her back to my place, lay her down in bed
And after she's stripped down, I say leave 'em on instead

Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans

I see you in the evening, keep 'em on in the tub
Washin wearing Wranglers, I think that I'm in love
Straight fit over bootcut, I'm begging down and please
Stay with me forever, don't take off those jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans, baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans, baby's wearing blue jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans...

// One More Tear To Cry //

Take it on the base, take it on the westbound line
Every time I love, I always seem to end up crying
So this is my goodbye, wrote it on the way back home
You say you never loved me, I wish somehow I could have known

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights

Back in Massachusetts, walking by the old high school
It's just the way I left it, except this time it's without you
Sleeping under starlight, just can't keep it from my dreams
My modus operandi is ripping right down, it seems

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights
One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights

// European Vegas //

So you think you're lonely, you think that you're the only one
Baby, listen closely, let me be your number one
The city's getting colder, the streets are turning into ice
So baby, hold me closer, let me stay for one more night

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

So baby, take my hand walking down the avenue
I know you wanted Paris, I guess that this will have to do
So come on quit your dreaming,girl I got the master plan
The city isn't so bad,when your with your lover man

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

// She's Really All I Need //

Up out of bed at three
And I feel like I'm dying
But if she's there next to me
Then there's no use in crying
Cause she's really all I need
It's true my heart is flying
Life can be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

I smell your arts degree
It's telling me I'm lazy
I'm working so I can eat
So keep that shit away from me
Cause she's really all I need
And up until I'm dying
Life will be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now
Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

// Moving Like Mike //

Take a step to the left and you're alright, got the snake skins on
Another step to the right in the moonlight, shake it all night long

You really gotta let it all hang loose when you're moving like Mike
You really gotta let me shake my boots when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let me hear you shout when you're moving like Mike

Dipping down to the slow spotlight, baby, take my hand
Another step to the right in the moonlight, baby, I'm your man

You really gotta let it all hang loose when you're moving like Mike
You really gotta let me shake my boots when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let me hear you shout when you're moving like Mike

You really gotta let it all hang loose when you're moving like Mike
You really gotta let me shake my boots when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let it all hang out when you're moving like Mike
So come on baby, let me hear you shout when you're moving like Mike

// Me And Jon, Hanging On //

Sweetheart, wipe those tears away and let me love you, baby
Oh darling, come out of your cave and let me love you, baby
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh

It's just me and Jon, we're hanging on
Trying it out, singing our song
It's just Jon and me and all that we've seen
Trying it out, plain as can be

Sweetheart, wipe those tears away and let me love you, baby
Oh darling, come out of your cave and let me love you, baby
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh

It's just me and Jon, we're hanging on
Trying it out, singing our song
It's just Jon and me and all that we've seen
Trying it out, plain as can be

// I'm A Man //

Creeping around up in downtown
Got the late night shift rolling up like this
Got a fresh pack of roys, the vice of this boy
Try to struck as I walk when I'm on my block

'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)
'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)

Try to keep myself clean for no one I've seen
Wearing all kind of shit that really don't fit
Five hundred and ones fit for this son
A pair of Levis jeans, you know what I mean

'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)
'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)
'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)
'Cause I'm a man (man), 'cause I'm a man (man)

// Only You //

Only you, only you, only you can treat me like you do
And only she, only she, only she shows me where I'll be
So sorry, boo, we're through

I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down
'Cause I'm done crying over her

Here I am, brand new day, now things do, let me show you, boo
And only she, only she, only she shows me where I'll be
So sorry, boo, we're through

'Cause I'm done getting over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt, I think I'll go lay down

Lay down, lay down, lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down, lay down

// Me And Mine //

Ah

Me and Mine we'll be alright
Long as she's standing at my side
Long as she's loving me
Mine and me we'll be unified

Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine

Mine and me, you and me oh
Looks like the echoes running low
Personal hope you weren't home
Too many lost but not alone

Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
Me, me, me and mine
