Album: AnotherOne

// The Way You'd Love Her //

How's your heart been beating
How's your skin been keeping
How's the dream been going
Since you came back home 
This time you left her out there somewhere
Told her how you feel but
Never really got your chance to show her, what it really means to love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

Closer to the ending
She's still out pretending
Prying eyes won't recognize the way she feels about him
She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Knowing all the time she'll never understand just what it means to love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

// Another One //

Feelin' so confused
You dont know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does and hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin at her door

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
[x2]

The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says shes true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
[x2]

// No Other Heart //

Is it true?
You've been feeling sort of low these days
Just don't have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

If it's so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Is it wrong? To think my love could really help you out
It's simply just my stubborn heart no doubt, rambling away
If it's not

Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
[x2]

// Just To Put Me Down //

She couldn't be from up above
I never want another one
Like her coming around

Picking me up
Just to put me down

She couldn't be from down below
For if she was, my heart would know
And when it knows it just won't go
Down

Picking me up
Just to put me down
[repeat]

// A Heart Like Hers //

Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone away my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And once this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

// I've Been Waiting For Her //

Give up my life for the rhythm
For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

// Without Me //

Will she love me again tomorrow
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

Without me [x4]

Will she find love again tomorrow
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

Without me [x4]
