Album: Polygondwanaland

// Crumbling Castle //

Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine
Under a void on the ghost land
The castle is a pimple on the face of the world
The embers burned for ghouls to tread if youâd please try

I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

We pray for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all of our holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out the
Fall of the end of the world if that were
[?] crumble down

In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
When my walls are safe from world weather
The build forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be visible
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

On this very day, in one thousand
Years the earth will be relative to the
Sun and the moon and a new world will be
Created, I know because it is written here

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

// Polygondwanaland //

Goodbye kinsman, polygon
I'm gone abroad, gondwanaland
Drift until I've poly-gone
Into my stop, gondwanaland
Grand and never been
Seen by man, veil of a dream

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

Exit, snow melts, polygon
Flown on rain drops, gondwanaland
It will get hot, polygon
Fasten seatbelts, gondwanaland
Sand and mountain
Unbosom his hidden hand

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

Polygondwanaland
Can I see the eye
That sees me? Please show me these

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

// The Castle In The Air //

The river opened her mouth and spat into a vast sea larger and bluer than a cloudless sky. Muscular, prodigious, immortal. But our vessel was invulnerable. It was well built, the boat rocked me into sleep and I floated through a deep dream, smooth sailing through the castle in the air.

One-eyed people living peaceful
With monopods and astomia
Without malice or kown
Without covetousness

Ohh, ahh

And there's men whose heads do
Grow beneath their shoulders
Maybe we'll find the world's center
Where equinox does not shatter
Spread our teaching
Alleviate their damnation

Ohh, ahh
Ohh, ahh

Without us they will go to hell
We are casting spells

Could it be
Faithful?
Could it seem
More real?
As I opened my eyes
The dream decolourised
Until it was un-skewered
And the harsh reality hit me like salty water

// Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet //

Deserted dunes welcome weary feet
Feel euphoric, Polygondwanaland
And so novel, Polygondwanaland
Prehistoric, Polygondwanaland
Living fossil, Polygondwanaland

It's full of dinosaurs

Nervous natives watch pompous pilgrims
Foreign nature, Polygondwanaland
Eerie jungle, Polygondwanaland
Our bodies are, Polygondwanaland
Tasty morsels, Polygondwanaland

It's full of dinosaurs

// Inner Cell //

Meet with me, in the dark
Of the street, there we'll start
Believing, secretly
Utopia, freedom in
The inner cell
Look for me, with a beak
A crocodont, scent of leaves
A void between, foul stench
Of those above, whispering
Inner cell

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

From under the skin, insurrection
From hollow logs, from shallow streams
And drying seas

Let us walk through the night
To a place clandestine
Free your mind, disregard
All you know, infiltrate
The inner cell
You must not accept
His sick version of
Life itself, disrespect
Everything, multiply
Inner cell

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

From under the skin, the flesh has rotted
Poison has spread, through words unsaid
Anemic rule, now hear me say
Our time has come, transcending us
Above the one, to ego death
For now he sits inside the fire
Oblivious that we will keep
Him in the spire, have found resolve
And our own crimes to commit
In cold blood as he did his

// Loyalty //

I see all there is
And has ever been
I am not a man
I am everything
Picture of purity
Deific reign
Ordained unto me
Prehistoric god
Theophany
I shall not move

Those who try
I will drink their blood

I'll be watching them
I am everywhere
Floating on the wind
Hiding in the dark
Pure omniscience
Traitors will quake
At the thought of me
Hang them on a hook
Put them on display
Examples must be made

Here's a test
I am Lord, fear my wrath
This is a test
I am Lord, I am death

What is with these crimes of treason?
I will fight this inquisition if I have to
I will not surrender if I'm backed into a corner
I will draw and quarter all their children
Just to prove I'm not a coward
I will put them all on Judas Cradle
Just to show them a god incarnate

Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
No man - no problem

// Horology //

Once upon a time
There was a great hermit dominion
Veiled from inside and out
Ruled by a lone eremite
Bringer of an inferno
Controller to Satan himself
To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set
A demented figurehead
Heinous looking thing, he was
Cold and terrible
A long and aquiline nose
Between swelling temples
His green eyes are windows
To the Ninth Circle of Hell
A tiny neck supporting a head
Filled with an unending desolation

Seditious bands storm the bastion
Alive with revenge
Grand intentions
Unbeknownst protomartyrs
Indoctrinated
With impalement

Just like that the plot was crushed
Brushed away without a thought
Some were found alive, though
Left to run without their skin
Cauterized and blistering
Forever marked for all to see
Reminding those who think dissent
Is a bridge across the sea
One did make a pilgrimage
In search of a family
Evaporated in the dark
Stolen by the despot
A journey made all the worse
Having had his eyes gouged
Left without the gift of sight
To face his true destroyer

Across the land he walked with death
Parading his
Oscillation
Upon reaching the castle walls
A twist of fate
His mind opens

Sit down weary traveler
I am that what you seek
Join me in a meal
To hear of my repentance
Lift the veil from your eyes
And look beyond the three
Now you know the truth behind:
It's tetrachromacy

// Tetrachromacy //

I've heard a story, could be true
About a colour under blue
You couldn't see it with your eyes
Or invent with intellect

Like the inverse of colourblindness
It shadows light in natural gas
I've got to see it for myself
Settle my own curiousness

Back and forth screaming like a tide
I look to the left and to the right
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

The story man was glassy-eyed
He told me about the power lines
And subarctic colored blue ice
The metal wires bursting to life

They flick across the territory
Resplendent like the sky
Some of the snow absorbs UV
Unseeable crumbs and dye

Picking up clues, bat my eyes
I screw them as the iris of the storm's eye
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

Polygondwanaland

Inconspicuous you and me
Crown in candle is lost in me
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

// Searching... //

Searching for the way
Try to brighten up my day
Searching for the gold
Inside the rainbow
Looking through rose-coloured glasses won't work
It won't change anything

My body's not a temple
It is a vessel
And a blank slate
An empty hard drive
Doctor please, I'll do anything
Alter me, let me see
Give me more
I want to see the world differently

Searching... searching...
Searching... searching...

I've been born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I'm analyzing information
Now I am a god

// The Fourth Colour //

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy

I'm back to birth
I see the light
Even in my face
My brain keeps information
Now I'm a god in a photon
I see through walls
I see your heat
I can see your terror
Can see your future

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour
I can see, tetrachromacy
I see the fourth colour

Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy
Seen green and Tiona has me
But I will be
Third eye is free
I am not a body
Tetrachromacy

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

I'm back to birth
I see the light
Even in my face
I analyze information
Now I am a god
