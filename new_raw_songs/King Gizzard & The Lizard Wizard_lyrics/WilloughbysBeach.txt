// Black Tooth //

Mama said I'm not OK
Cause I've been talking in my sleep
And dad said I'm not OK
Cause I don't ever brush my teeth

A-oh-ah...

Mama said I'm not OK
Cause I been talking in my sleep
And dad said I'm not OK
Because I never brush my teeth

A-oh-ah...

They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning
They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning
They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning

A-oh-oh...

They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning
They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning
They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning, morning
They make me get up in the morning, morning, morning

A-oh-oh...

Pull my finger
Punch my face
You're all happy
Cause my nose is bleedin' all over the place
I go whoa-oh-oh-oh...

Pull my finger

It is good 'cause it is good
It's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope this gets me high
'Cause I've got a simple mind

Wo-oh-oh...

And it is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope you get me high
'Cause I've got a simple mind

Wo-oh-oh...
