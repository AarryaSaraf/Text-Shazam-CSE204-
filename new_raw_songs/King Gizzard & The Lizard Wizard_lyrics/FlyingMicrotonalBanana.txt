// Rattlesnake //

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Vegetation
Aggravation
Found him hiding
Snake is smiling
Whips his tail
Leaves you riling

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle

Hibernation
Altercation
Don't get angry
Snake is cranky
Whips his tail
In a frenzy

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
While you're immobile
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

// Melting //

Thawing ices
Worse than ISIS
Worse than the most deadly virus
Living harmonious
Is desirous
How can we with absent-mindedness?

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

Conflagrated
And cremated
When the world is consummated
Devastated
Populated
World of isolated mortal folk

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

Toxic air is
Here to scare us
Fatal fumes from melting ferrous
All we discuss
Is superfluous
If we can't keep our hands to ourselves

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

// Open Water //

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
How'd I falter?
Open water

Height of the sea
Will bury me
And all I see is
Open water

Open water
Open water

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
How'd I falter?
Open water

Plight of poor me
No use for screaming here
I'll drown in
Open water

Open water
Open water

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
How'd I falter?
Open water

The sea is all
That I can see
I'll die alone in
Open water

Open water
Open water

I know something's been lurking
In the depths of murky water
There are ripples and bubbles appearing
Over by the sunken ship
And bells are ringing in my head
I think I'm done - I think I'm dead
As something pulls my paddling leg under...
Asphyxiate, it's more than I can take
This briny tangy salty water in my lungs
And deeper darker bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

I know something's been lurking

Asphyxiate, it's more than I can take
This briny tangy salty water in my lungs
And deeper darker bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

Where'd the shore gone?
How'd I falter?

// Sleep Drifter //

Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting
Drifting in and out of sleep
Reality begins to fray
You'll become so close to me
In a hotel far away

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting

Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting

I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting

I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting

Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, sleep drifter

I can feel you touch me...
And I can hear you breathing...
Please no one wake me...
When I'm sleep drifting

// Billabong Valley //

Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in

Bloodthirsty tendencies
Anti-authority
Mad dog Morgan
He never gave a warning
Mad dog Morgan
Shot in the back by morning

Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in

He never gave a warning

// Anoxia //

I don't care
"Take a chance" you said
Melt the coins in your pants
But make no sound for me my friend
Be calm in the wind
Tearing through town
A dog-less bark
Is a lonely sound
The cold ground moans
Untold histories
It sings its birdsong
To me

A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

We waste no time
Leaving in light
A different sun
Bakes the breeze tonight
My mind wanders
Alone
Let my body
Be aquatic
Burn us a road
Straight to the sea
I'll be your seatbelt
Baby

A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

// Doom City //

Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city

I think I'll die
When Doom City air this way comes
He, in Empyrean
Breathes from his mouth and over tongue
Sky will crucify
Tear little holes in my lungs
I think I'll die
When Doom City air this way comes

Doom City
Doom City

Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city

Spark in firmament
Doom City sky opens up
He disorients
Everyone's lives with his breath
Charged with particles
Doom City air rips me up
Unbelievable
Doom City sky makes him laugh

Doom City
Doom City
Doom City
Doom City

// Nuclear Fusion //

Nuclear fusion

Look into the sky and see the pattern
Reflecting in your eye from a distance
Mirroring the stars are the atoms
Mixing up like a cocktail

The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

Ocean like a moat fortification
Separating me from restoration
My spirit leaves my body in frustration
Flying through the world in radiation

The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

All that I ever see is nuclear fusion
All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion
(Nuclear fusion)
