// Stressin' //

Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
And I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct
Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
And I'm dreamin'
Stressin' is an instinct

Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

Safe travel
Walk into another
Well I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct
My apartment
Is a clever lover
He told me
Stressin' is an instinct

Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
I'm feeling
Stressin' is an instinct
Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
I'm dreaming
Stressin' is an instinct

// Vegemite //

I love, I love my Vegemite
It's strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

Vegemite
I like Vegemite
I like, I like

And when everyone's getting grumpy cos it's early
I'll have breakfast with my girlfriend
And we'll have toast with avocados
And tomatoes and Vegemite

Cos I love, I love my Vegemite
It's strong as hell and black as night
I keep my love all screwed up tight
And spread it thick whenever I like, I like

Vegemite
I like Vegemite
I like, I like

// It's Got Old //

Well I'm always saying I'm sorry
You're always saying you're broke
But I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel
If you keep your eyes on the road

But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old

You'll always run me in circles
Chasing me round like a mouse
But I'll keep on watching this movie
If it means I can stay at your house

But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old

// Work This Time //

I knock hello
But I see that you've got hypothermia
So I place a block to stop the rot
And hope that I can warm you up

Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind?
'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined

Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
I know I'm lazy but baby I will work this time

It's kind of funny
That I live the poetry I can not write
But you my beauty
Shall be fixed forever loosely in my heart

Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind?
'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined

Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
I know I'm lazy but baby I will work this time

// ABABCd. //

ABA, BCd
(Will show you how it feels)
To be stuck outside your sanity
(And wrapped around infinity)
I want to leave but I can't conceive that
I'll snap back to reality
(I'll snap back to reality)

// Sleepwalker //

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee...

Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to walk in the ocean

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee
Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to sleepwalk with you, ohooh now

I caught you sleeping on the wrong side of the bed
So I got up, wow wow, switched my side
Your voice gets hoarse when you get too cold
I'll warm you up, wow wow, warm you up

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee

If you're thinking then you're thinking too hard
So squish your brain, wow wow, numb the pain

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee
Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to sleepwalk with you, ohooh now
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee

// Hot Wax //

Hot wax crawling under the door
Hot wax crawling under the floor
Hot wax creeping under the hill
Hot wax creeping under the sill

Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning
Now come on a safari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

Hot wax creeping under the scene
Hot wax dripping under the fiend
Hot wax leaking under the sink
Hot wax leaking under the drain
Hot wax coming under the Lord
Hot wax coming under the door
Hot wax coming into the brain
Hot wax coming into the maze

Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning
Now come on a safari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning
Now come on a safari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

Hot wax dripping under the scene
Hot wax dripping under the fiend
Hot wax leaking under the sink
Hot wax leaking under the drain
Hot wax rising from beneath
Hot wax rising from the leaves
Hot wax rising under my bed
Hot wax running up my legs

Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

// Crying //

Came in my window crying
Said that she's sick of all his lying about me
I said I ain't got time for her
I'm gonna close the door when I go walking

Out, out, out, out

Came to me Monday Morning
Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning
He said the same thing that she said
Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't

Mine, mine, mine, mine

Baby you always acted like, baby you never cared
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy

Cry, cry, cry, cry

I ain't gonna be the one to watch you fall down the stairs
With the way you act girl, you're bound to make your guy

Cry, cry, cry, cry

// Homeless Man In Adidas //

I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company

Sit on the roof
Watch the cars travel past
Ain't no way of getting lonely
And I'll sit real still and watch everyone go fast
With only me

Lay on the bay
Watch it all float away
Ain't no way of getting lonely
Watch all the people and the bikes come my way
With only me

I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely

// Oddments //

Oddments, there is nothing to care
'Cause it's all that I will ever do
Odd! Ments!
O, D, D, M, E, N, T, S
