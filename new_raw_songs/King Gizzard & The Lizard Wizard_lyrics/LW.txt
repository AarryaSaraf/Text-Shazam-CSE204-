// If Not Now, Then When? //

If not now, then when?
When the forest's nearly gone.
When the hole's in the ozone.
When the bees are gone.
If not now, then when?
When the ocean's coming up.
When the rain just won't stop.
When the fire's burning.
If not now, then when?

If not now, then when?
When big pharma's rippin' me.
When my data's tracking me.
When my phone is spying.
If not now, then when?
When my choice is monitored.
When computers are cleverer.
When our food is poison.
If not now, then...

This is an emergency.
Need to act more quickly.
This is no quandary.
This is an emergency.

This is an emergency.
Need to act more quickly.
This is no quandary.
This is an emergency.

When the oceans turn to black.
When the animals are dead.
When the birds are gone.
If not now, then when?
When the blue sky turns into black.
When Gaia hangs by a thread.
When all the people die.
If not now, then when?

// O.N.E //

One night everywhere, one night everywhere
One night everywhere, one night everywhere

Dawn has reared its welcome head
I lay in bed bravely
Waiting for the day to begin

Hours pass reading the news of the day
That begins in such a state
I bravely await fate

Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it contained?
One night everywhere turned to nowhere

Human race deserves its steaming fate on a plate
We did exploit the fish of the sea
And the birds of the heavens
And even the bugs in the ground
And every creeping thing that creeps on Earth

Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it contained?
One night everywhere turned to nowhere

// Pleura //

Bone stock brewed up, graveyard shoot up
Came in trapdoor, thrown up on the floor
Servants of the lord of lung slaughter
The Necromancer
Woo!

Orange baby always squealing
Cradle snatch the new world fading
The final test, it takes your breath
Desecrates our grave
Woo!

Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then necromancer will thank us all

Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura

Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then necromancer will thank us all
Suck the life from what you love
I learnt that from the orange one
No one to answer to after the fall
Necromancer will dance on us all

Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then necromancer will thank us all

Pleura
Pleura
Pleura

Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura
Cheat me out living my life?
I exercise my right to die

// Supreme Ascendancy //

How can you get away with a murder?
Scot-Free when you're found guilty in the first degree
It's pretty simple when you're so powerful
It's who you know
Untouchable, lying through your teeth
Break the doctrine, they're all laughing
Double-parking tax-free control monopoly
So complacent, it's adjacent to the demons you summon from your faculty

Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs

Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy

Satan in a cassock casting black magic
Childhoods tragically ripped from their shaking feet
Conscious yet inadequate
The bullshit catalyst
Far flung inaction by the ministry of presbytery

Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
Holy hands of God
Justice impedes

Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Permanent purgatory

// Static Electricity //

Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Singularity at the point of contacting
Lightning strikes deep inside digital cells in my mind
Torn apart like a baguette
Rip the husk from the brown rice
Lacerate the pig flesh and shape the machine out of clay
Blow the brain up in your hand and replace the ashes with static

Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Strangers divergent
They were once one, now they're two
Species come late to the fold
Ships in the night sail home
Cannonball falls from the sky
Sever the deck with a mind
Made of metal in plain sight
Invisible ball of death
Run by a rogue mutant brain
In a bubble of golden static

Split you and me, static electricity

Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies
Static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies
Static electricity
Split you and me (split you and me)
Static electricity
Split you and me (split you and me)
Static electricity
Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me
Static electricity

Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Static electricity

Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies
Static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies
Static electricity

// East West Link //

All the highways: like terminal airways
All the highways: like sapien DNA

We can build a road
We can cut a tree
We can shoot a bird
Nobody will see

All the highways: like terminal airways
All the highways: like sapien DNA

Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up
Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world

Woo!

Woo!

We can kill the worms
Underneath the trees
We can tunnel in
Nobody will see

All the highways: like terminal airways
All the highways: like sapien DNA

Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up
Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world

// Ataraxia //

Take no position on good or bad
Much watched is the doing so fuck the tarot's read
The life I lead, it has a taste
Like milk drank from the teat, curdles at a certain age

Get with ataraxia, force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

Shame the mirrors that stretch my hips
Mute the hypochondria that whispers spoilers in my ear
I'm not a father yet so don't ask again
Salt the snail and teach it to obtain

Lay in, ataraxia
Set the kindling
Weigh in
Ataraxia
Absolve me of my skin
Shame him, name him, cut me down to size
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

Get with ataraxia, force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think
Ataraxia
Ataraxia

// See Me //

How can anybody see me when I am invisible and
How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible?
How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance?
How can everyday I survive turn so easily to night?

How can any body see me?
I'm invisible
How can any body see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore

How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person?
How on earth can someone like me be intangible to others?
How do all the people do the things that people do around me?
How can anybody move when our planet is suffocating?

How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

How can any body see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can any body see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

See me, see me, see me, see me
See me
