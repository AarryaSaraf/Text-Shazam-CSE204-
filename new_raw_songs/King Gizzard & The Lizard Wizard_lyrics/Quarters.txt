// The River //

Once you're in the zone
The river flows down like a full stone
Water is your bed
The ripples cushion your head

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

Once you're where I led
It will be clear what I have said
Float without a home
The river flows like another long road

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

Frozen over home
The fading light shines on the white stone
Melt your little zone
And sink into the waterfall flow

I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

// Infinite Rise //

Set straight
Vibrate
Need a hug
Coffee mug
Minor flop
Don't stop

What's more?
What's it for right now?

Days drop
Hearts stop
Days we've traveled
And hearts unraveled
Heart attack
Hear me back
Pig sty
Don't cry

Cat's eyes
Capsize
Making time
Lifeline
Limelight
No right

What's more?
What's it for right now?

Nice light
Sunrise
Bound together
Like boys in leather
Raisin bread
Wreck the head
Crack pipe
Red light

Satan
Is hatin'
Days old
Bread mould
Jesus
Kills us
Exalt
My fault

Daylight
Insight
Free roam
Go home
Bell tollin'
Hell holin'

What's more?
What's it for right now?

Free style
Meanwhile
White wash
Kibosh
Stranger
Danger
Lightning
Frightening

Sell soul
Keep whole
Make some money
Eat some honey
Make friend
Keep them

What's more?
What's it for right now?

Loose mind
Kook time
Getting better
Wearing sweater
High brow
Cash cow
Infinite
Rise now

Fats game
Right as rain
Tinned spaghetti
Is good for brekky
Day bed
Rest head
Brown moth
Red sloth

Look smart
Make art
Golden dragon
Subway taggin'
Go nuts
Make fuss

What's more?
What's it for right now?

Car pool
People
Oars and paddles
Horse and saddles
You're gone
So long
Day's great
Go play

Playwright
Blindside
Before
Bedsore
Deep grill
Sit still
I'll cook
A big chook

// God Is In The Rhythm //

Earth by the moon
Darker days come soon
Owl sings a tune
Surely she knows too

Bird is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm

Earth by the sun
Brighter days to run
Rain knows the sun
Knows it's not time to come

Rain is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm

Seasons move
Everybody knows it's true
Springs brings a dew
Hibernates winters tune

Summer's waiting
Expectating (expectating)
God is in the seasons

Trees know it too
The perfect time to bloom
The leaf asks the sun
Knows his time has come

Leaf is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm

Wind blows a song
From the desert to the pond
Frog waves the wand
And the wind blows on beyond

Frog is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm

Earth by the stars
We have all come from Mars
We all know it too
We belong to the soup

We are waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm
We are waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm

// Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer //

Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn

Lover its all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye
Caught in a wind beam, out in the sky stream, mornin'
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly
