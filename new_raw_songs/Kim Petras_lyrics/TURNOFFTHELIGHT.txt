// There Will Be Blood //

There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood, blood

(There will be)
In the club, I can't save you now
Ain't nobody can hear you shout
When I'm pulling you underground
(There will be)
Take a sip from the devil's cup
Just a taste, you won't get enough
Seal your fate when you swallow up

(There will be)
Don't let me in, I'ma ruin your life
I'm straight psychotic
(There will be)
This is gonna be a hell of a night
I know you want it

There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, Go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
(There will be blood)

(There will be)
When you're begging and on your knees
That's when I get a sweet release
You can't run from your destiny
(There will be)
I've been dying to feel alive
And your pain is my paradise
So tonight you gon' pay the price

(There will be)
Don't let me in, I'ma ruin your life
I'm straight psychotic
(There will be)
This is gonna be a hell of a night
I know you want it

There will be blood
Run for your life
Go on and say, Go on and say your last goodbye
There will be blood
You're gonna die (You're gonna die)
You'll never make it, never make it through the night
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood
There will be blood, blood
(There will be)

// Wrong Turn //

You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You met the wrong one, met the wrong one, on the wrong night
Yeah, you took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time

Never should've came alone
Never gonna make it home
Nothing matters anymore
Go ahead and lock the door
You're my bloody valentine
You can't hide behind the blinds
Hurry, quick, you're out of time
Out of time

It's your final destination
Count your blessings
Time to make a sacrifice
Take a deep breath
Let it sink in
Now you realize

You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You met the wrong one, met the wrong one, on the wrong night
Yeah, you took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time

Follow flames, bloody bones
Whips and chains, heart to stone
I am who you really fear
Hold your tears, save the press
Demons, bottles, crucified
You and death come eye to eye
Go and kiss your life goodbye
Kiss your life goodbye

It's your final destination
Count your blessings
Time to make a sacrifice
Take a deep breath
Let it sink in
Now you realize

You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time

// <demons> //

The spirits are why the house is possessed
They've never existed in physical form
They've only exist in spirit form
It's true evil
Demons

// Massacre //

Who are you

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

Blood on the floor, glamour and gauze
Stain on the glass, make this the last night that you're here
Bites on your neck, can't dodge a hex
Show me respect, I see the death, I smell the fear
Don't be afraid, just take my hand
Come follow me, I promise that I'll take you there
Just you and me, can't even breath
Can't hear your scream (La, la la la, la, la la la)

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

One taste of blood is not enough to satisfy
Take your last breath and get a rush, gotta die to feel alive
Sweet evil come deliver us the sacrifice
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, gotta die to feel alive

Dawn of the dead, blood ruby red
Don't lose your head, love when you beg, love when you cry
Queen of the Damned, that what I am
Reborn again, I never end, I never die
Don't let me in, I see the sin
Under your skin, you can't escape, you can't deny
Seek and I find, nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide (La la la la, la la la la)

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

One taste of blood is not enough to satisfy
Take your last breath and get a rush, gotta die to feel alive
Sweet evil come deliver us the sacrifice
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, gotta die to feel alive

Don't try to fight it, just close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes

Go on and say, say your last words
Sometimes the best things kinda hurt
'Cause this is real, it's unrehearsed
My fatal touch, you'll feel cursed, yeah

// Turn Off The Light //

[Kim Petras:]
Midnight
Under moonlight
Chills down your spine
Fear in your eyes
Feelin' malicious
Heard you like it vicious
All your dirty wishes
We were made to do it

C'mon, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Hot stuff
Know you like it rough
When I put it on ya, you'll never get enough
Feelin' the pressure
The pain turns into pleasure
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya
Ooh, I'm gonna get ya

C'mon, are you curious enough to taste it?
To taste it

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh, ahh

[Elvira:]
Only in the darkness will you find your true self
Howl at the moon to awaken the spell
One cannot judge what the eye cannot see
Outside the realm of humanity
Embrace your fear, don't dare to run
Only then will you be what you're meant to become

[Kim Petras:]
If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light
If you wanna take a bite, wanna see the dark side
C'mon, turn off the light
C'mon, turn off the light

If you're looking for a fright and you wanna do it right

// Tell Me It's A Nightmare //

Tell me how we got here
I see you, but you're not there
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare
And you ain't going nowhere
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price

Should've seen it coming baby
Should've seen it in my eyes
It's not like I never told ya
Shouldn't come as a surprise
You were high on the adrenaline
But you always wanted more
I'm a demon in the shadows
And you stepped into the dark

I confessed this, I can't stop
I'm possessive, I chew you up
You took everything I gave you
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here
I see you, but you're not there
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare (tell me it's a nightmare)
And you ain't going nowhere (and you ain't going nowhere)
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price (yeah)

It's running through my veins
And it's everything I touch
Be careful when you love me
I'm only out for blood
You know I'd be the end of you
But you always wanted more
(Be careful what you wish for)

Tell me how we got here (tell me how we got here)
I see you, but you're not there (I see you, but you're not there)
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price
Tell me it's a nightmare (tell me it's a nightmare)
And you ain't going nowhere (and you ain't going nowhere)
Try to save ya, warn ya, keep you alive
Try to stop ya, but you paid the price
You paid the price

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Whoo, ah!

// i don't wanna die... //

Ahh
I don't wanna die
Ahh
I just wanna live

Ahh
Ahh

// In The Next Life //

First time in my life I, I'm not afraid
First time I remember feeling anything, anything
There's no turning back now, I can't be saved
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

I'm the greatest, God created
I'm a sickness, I'm contagious
I'm a demon, power trippin'
On the mission and vindictive
Suffocating, exterminating
And I love that every second
Full of hatred, irritated
Cut you open for entertainment

Oooh
They'll remember me
Oooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen
Ich bin dein Alptraum
Ich bin dein Omen
Wenn du mich siehst, fÃ¤ngst du besser an zu laufen
Kannst du glauben
Sag jetzt deine letzten Worte
Ich krieg' immer was ich wollte
Ich bin das Ende deiner Tage
Ich bin die Krankheit, ich bin die Plage

Oooh
They'll remember me
Oooh
You'll remember me

First time in my life, I (First time in my life)
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
First time I remember feeling anything, anything (anything)
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back)
I can't be saved (I can't be saved)
And in the next life they'll remember me, remember me

// Boo! Bitch! //

Break!

Woo, ah!
Oh

// Everybody Dies //

Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies

Mama's gonna get a call one day
That her baby's dead and gone away
I been knocking on Heaven's door
Since the day that I was born
Yeah, since a young girl
Always knew that I was trouble
Livin' like a loaded pistol
'Cause when you're gone is when they miss ya

So I'm gon' rebel until the end
And when I go down, I'ma see you in Hell
You can't scare me, I'm prepared
So give me all my roses while I'm here

Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies (Everybody dies)


So scatter all my ashes in the sea
Promise me that you'll remember me
Never was who I was supposed to be
But I never gave apologies, no
Where I lay these 'Lenciagas is my home
I'm a rollin' stone

So I'm gon' rebel (Rebel) until the end (The end)
And when I go down, I'ma see you in Hell (See you in Hell)
You can't scare me, I'm prepared
So give me all my roses while I'm here

Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies (Everybody dies)

// Party Till I Die //

I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
Wanna get it started, started
Started, started, started
We're runnin' out of ti-i-i-ime
Every-everybody-body
Body, body, body
Is coming through toni-i-i-ight
And I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
P-party till I die

Only time I come alive
Is in the middle of the night
Looking for another high
(Looking for another high, high-igh)
Don't care if it's killing me
This is all I really need
My body's in ecstasy
(My body's in ecstasy-sy)

Dark paradise calling me home
We already know where we're gonna go

I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
Wanna get it started, started
Started, started, started
We're runnin' out of ti-i-i-ime

And I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
P-party till I die

P-p-p-party till I

I'ma end up dead, I'll still be in Vetements
Find me in the back with a lethal weapon
All designer drugs all up in my system
Party till I die, till my resurrection
When I'm gone, I'ma be a legend
Sex icon like Marilyn Manson
Look in the mirror, all I see is REDÐ¯UM
I'll see you in hell, heaven's not an option

Dark paradise calling me home
We already know where we're gonna go

I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
Wanna get it started, started
Started, started, started
We're runnin' out of ti-i-i-ime
Every-everybody-body
Body, body, body
Is coming through toni-i-i-ight
And I just wanna party, party
Party, party, party
Party till I die-ie-ie-ie
P-party till I die
