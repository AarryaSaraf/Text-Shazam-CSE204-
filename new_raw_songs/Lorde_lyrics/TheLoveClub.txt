// Bravado //

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do

'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand-new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

// Million Dollar Bills //

There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

We could leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark

We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

// The Love Club //

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
"What about the kid?" It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people
Who watched you grow up
When you're a member
Go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

// Biting Down //

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down)

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
