Album: Unbreakable

// Forever Love //

Everyday is an endless summer
Every night with you is a dream
With us it's all or nothing
Ain't no in between
Let's keep the music playing
Playing out our love song
Safe inside your arms
Is right where I belong
I never felt like this, oh
With just one kiss

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
Let's make this last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, it's gonna be different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love

Boy, I wanna fix you dinner
Open up a bottle of wine
Yeah, get a little too close
Maybe see a few sparks fly
When you're laying there beside me
The only thing I wanna do
Underneath this lone star sky
Is lose myself in you
Over and over again
It was only a matter of when

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
Let's make this last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, it's gonna be different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love
Forever love, oh
Oh, forever love

What I thought was love
Was one long string of maybes
I've been broken too
But I never let it break me
Then you saved me
Oh, you saved me

It happened so fast
Oh, before I knew it
We were dancing in the moonlight
We're making it last
Breathe in every moment
Boy, I know it's different this time
Baby, have you ever
Ever felt forever love
Forever love
Oh, forever love

This is forever love
Oh, this is forever love

// Safe //

The storm is calling, rain's falling down like tears
The water's rising, bringing on my darkest fears
I need a lighthouse, someone to guide my way
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Sometimes it's heavy, this life can be so cold
Sometimes I feel lost, can't seem to get back home
I need a compass, someone to guide my way
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Come on love, show me love, take this crying from my eyes
Come on love, show me love, I could use some tonight
All the daylight's fading, my hope is slippin' away
Oh, baby wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Come on love, show me love, take this crying from my eyes
Come on love, show me love, I could use some tonight
All the daylight's fading, my hope is slippin' away
Oh, just wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe

Oh, please wrap your arms around me, let me know I'm safe
Let me know I'm safe

// Unbreakable //

Too big, too small, too in between, I've heard it all
You'll never stand out in a crowd
Too different, too plain, no one gonna know your name
You'll never make nobody proud

But when the going gets tough, the tough start swinging
The storm picks up, the strong just lean in
The road gets rough, we say bring it on

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

They laugh at your tears, pour their poison in your ears
They say you never have, you never will

But when the going gets tough, the tough start swinging
The storm picks up, the strong just lean in
The road gets rough, we say bring it on

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

Let it all crash in, let it all come down

Let it all crash in, let it all come down
Take your shot world, what you got
We'll just keep picking ourselves up off the ground
Sometimes we gotta burn to learn that there's a fire in us all, yeah
It's gonna hurt but sometimes we gotta fall
To find out we're unbreakable
Unbreakable

Oh, oh, unbreakable
Yeah, unbreakable
We're unbreakable
