// Pretty Little Mustang //

You got the perfect dress waiting on a hanger
The kind that makes you feel a little dangerous
Don't you know you're gonna drive those boys right out of their minds
Hey, don't you know it's high time that you shine

So, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
In your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

Go on and light up the dark just like a firefly
Drop every jaw in the room when you walk by
Only like the sky owns the stars and the moon
Make them all breathlessly want more and more of you

So, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, drive it like you stole it, like you're making a getaway
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
Yeah, your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

You got the perfect dress waiting on a hanger
Oh, put the top down, put the top down

Put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind

Oh, put the top down on your pretty little mustang
Oh, roll through town like you own the whole damn thing
Making heads turn, making hearts spin, flying like the wild wind
In your pretty little mustang
Yeah, your pretty little mustang

Oh, your pretty little mustang

// Why Baby Why //

Your suitcase is gone, with all of your things
Our old picture frames are empty
I burned all your letters, I took off your ring
But what can I do with these memories
Keeping me up 'til the dawn, hanging on like you're coming back
But you ain't coming back

So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Ohh I try baby try baby try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

I close my eyes when I kiss his lips
Praying this time I will see you
I'm real good at lying to everyone else
But I just can't lie to myself
When the truth is a shadow that follows me
Haunting me just like a ghost, if you're just a ghost

Tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Ohh I try baby try baby try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

I saw your taillights fade into the dark
And my head knows but there's no convincing my heart

So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Ohh I try baby try baby try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
You know that I'm crying
Why, baby, why?

// Somebody Else Will //

So he broke your heart in a jagged line
And he brought the rain and he stole your shine
And now you're crying on the bedroom floor
And you're feeling like the storm ain't ever gonna let up
They say everything happens for a reason
But right now you don't wanna believe it
You wanna ride around all over time
Letting all the sad songs break you down
Every mile, but just give it a while

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
Somebody else will

I know it's cliche but you know it's true
There's a million more fishes in the deep blue
No he ain't the only one
Pretty soon your sinking sun is gonna be rising up
So whatever good ain't good enough

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
So much better, so don't settle
'Til you feel the way that it's s'posed to feel
Yeah if he don't love you like he ought to
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
I'm telling you, girl, somebody else will

Don't worry, love ain't in a hurry
Yeah I know you think you're spinning your wheels
But one day it's gonna find you
If he don't love you, somebody else will
So much better, so don't settle
'Til you feel the way that it's s'posed to feel
Yeah if he don't love you like he ought to
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
Somebody else will
I'm telling you, girl, somebody else will

// Better Than You Left Me //

You said goodbye
With words cold as ice
I was shaking
Watching you go
I couldn't breathe
No, I just couldn't see
Past you leaving
Me here all alone
It's funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now here you are
Trying to win back my heart
And I bet you
Thought it'd be easy to do
But baby I've changed
Now you get a taste of standing
On the side where you lose
Ain't it funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now I love deeper
And I laugh a little bit louder
I smile brighter
And I fly higher

I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me
Oh, I'm better than you left me
