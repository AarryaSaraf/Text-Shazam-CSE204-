// Heaven Down Here //

Hey God, it's me
I hate to be a bother
But I could use a minute or two
Yeah, I'm just so
Heartbroken, disappointed
In the way this world is coming unglued

And I can't help but wonder are you

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies
In this wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy
But if you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven

Hey God, I know
I don't hit you up that often
But the world is turning upside down
I swear it feels
Like all we've got is problems
And there's so many, I'm losing count

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies in this
Wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy
But If you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven

Hey God, it's me
We're really going though it
And I can't help but wonder are you

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies
In this wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy but
If you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven

// Bridges //

You're on your side and I'm on mine
And in between this great divide
There's fire in the streets
People on their knees
Holding bibles and breaking glass
Guns and armor, tears and gas
If smoke is all we see
How we supposed to breathe?

What if we took these stones we've been throwin'?
What if we laid 'em down?
What if we forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges

I know you're scared and so am I
But that don't mean we shouldn't try
It ain't just black or white
It's down to wrong or right

What if we took these stones we've been throwin'?
What if we laid 'em down?
What if we forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges

We're gonna need more than prayers and wishes
To build those bridges, bridges, bridges
It's gonna take way more work to fix it
Gotta build those bridges, bridges, bridges

We gotta take these stones we've been throwin'
We gotta lay them down
We gotta forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges
Bridges, bridges, bridges
Gonna build those bridges, bridges, bridges
Bridges, bridges, bridges

// Salt //

Girl on mission
Just tryna turn some heads
She needs attention
Look at that look at me dress
Her kinda trouble should come
With a warning sign (Don't let her fool you, don't be a fool)

She act like she don't notice
That left hand band of gold
Got that money motive
Will wreck a happy home
Yeah, there's a snake takin' names
In the bar tonight (Don't let her fool you, don't be a fool)

Yeah, she'll break you're heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt

She'll let you kiss her
But it comes with a price
That sweet gets bitter
Then she's cold as ice
Her kinda trouble should
Come with a warning sign (A warning sign)

Yeah, she'll break your heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt

Yeah, she's (Fake, fake, fake) as the extensions that she's wearing
(Stay, stay, stay) far away cause she don't care and
She'll tie you down then cut you loose
Pours on the sugar then salt in your wounds

Yeah, she'll break you're heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt
