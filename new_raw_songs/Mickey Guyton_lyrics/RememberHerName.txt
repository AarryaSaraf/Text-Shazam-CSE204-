// What Are You Gonna Tell Her? //

She thinks life is fair and
God hears every prayer
And everyone gets their ever after
She thinks love is love and if
You work hard, that's enough
Skin's just skin and it doesn't matter

And that her friend's older brother's gonna keep his hands to himself
And that somebody's gon' believe her when she tells

But what are you gonna tell her
When she's wrong?
Will you just shrug and say it's been that way all along?
What are you gonna tell her
When she figures out
That all this time you built her up just so the world could let her down?
Yeah, what do you tell her?
What are you gonna tell her?

Do you just let her pretend
That she could be the president?
Would it help us get there any faster?
Do you let her think the deck's not stacked?
And gay or straight or white or black
You just dream and anything can happen

What are you gonna tell her
When she's wrong?
Will you just shrug and say it's been that way all along?
What are you gonna tell her
When she figures out
That all this time you built her up just so the world could let her down?
Yeah, what do you tell her?
What are you gonna tell her?

Do you tell her not to fight?
Is it worth the sacrifice?
Can you look her in the face
And promise her that things'll change?

What are you gonna tell her?
Maybe you can't
'Cause there ain't no way, you can't explain what you don't understand
What the hell do you tell her?
What the hell do you tell her?

What are you gonna tell her?
What are you gonna tell her?

// Rosé //

Everybody's singing 'bout whiskey
Everybody's talkin' 'bout tequila
Moonshine drippin' in the moonlight
Lips tastin' like sangria

There's always a time for strawberry wine
But it ain't that time right now
Don't buy me a beer when I'm sittin' here
Give me something that's sweet going down

RosÃ© all day
I'm talkin' pretty in pink
Baby, that's my kinda drink
You can call it what you want, but everybody loves a good clichÃ©
Don't need no bougie sommelier
There's no point in askin' 'cause I'm gonna say, "RosÃ©"

It doesn't matter how gray the skies are (Skies are)
Or how much greener everybody's grass is
Everything's gonna look brighter (Brighter)
When you see it through a rose colored glass

RosÃ© all day
I'm talkin' pretty in pink
Baby, that's my kinda drink
You can call it what you want, but everybody loves a good clichÃ©
Don't need no bougie sommelier
There's no point in askin' 'cause I'm gonna say, "RosÃ©"

Give me that rosÃ©
That's right
Want some of that rosÃ©

(Hey) Out of a bottle or out of a box
Pop off that cork or twist off that top
Drink it from crystal or out of a can
As long as it's cold, and it's here in my hand

Yeah, that rosÃ©
Give me that rosÃ©
RosÃ© all damn day
I'm talkin' pretty in pink
Bab, that's my kinda drink
You can call it what you want, but everybody loves a good clichÃ©
Don't need no bougie sommelier
There's no point in askin' 'cause I'm gonna say, "RosÃ©"

Give me that rosÃ©
That's right

I know I want it, I gotta have it
You get me that, go get me that rosÃ©

// Black Like Me //

Little kid in a small town
I did my best just to fit in
Broke my heart on the playground, mmh
When they said I was different

Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be black like me

My daddy worked day and night
For an old house and a used car
Just to live that good life, mmh
It shouldn't be twice as hard

Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me

Oh, I know
I'm not
The only one
Oh, yeah
Who feels
Like I
I don't belong

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
And if you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me
Oh, and some day we'll all be free
And I'm proud to be, oh, black like me
And I'm proud to be black like me
I'm proud to be black like me
Black like me

// Remember Her Name //

Birds on a wire all fly away
Nobody wanna stand in a hurricane
When everyone else walks away
She'll still remain

Where did you lose the girl with no fear
Oh she never left
Take a good look she's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name

Don't let go of that wide eyed innocence
Let that wild child run on the wind
Keep that shine, that lights up the room
Hold onto it

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name

Where did you lose the girl with no fear
Oh she never left
Take a good look she's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name

// All American //

We're the lines on the interstate
The dust on a back road
We're a Friday night football game
The lighters at a rock show
We're the night shift, smoke break, high school heartache
Driving with the windows down
We're the dance floors, church pews, suit and ties, tattoos
One big small town

Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

We're the stars in a Texas sky
And the jukebox vinyl
We're the New York city lights
And a hotel bible
We're hand me down, tailor made, daisy dukes, dookie braids
James Brown and James Dean
We're cold beer, champagne, millionaires, spare some change
And everything in between

Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
We got the same stars, the same stripes
Just wanna live that good life
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

We're different in a million ways
But at the end of the day
Ain't we all (Ain't we all), All American

Ain't we all (Ain't we all), ain't we all All American (All American)
Ain't we all (Ain't we all), ain't we all All American (All American)
We got the same stars, the same stripes (The same stripes)
Just wanna live that good life
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

Ain't we all, All American

// Different //

I love my skin, I love my hair
And if it bothers you, I really don't care
I love my hips, I love my thighs
The way they move and they shake when the beat's just right

And my momma always said
Everybody's got their own kinda rhythm
And you better celebrate what you is
Never mind what's you isn't

'Cause that's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?
'Cause that's what makes you different

Don't wanna fit in, I wanna fit out
Don't want no cookie cutter watering me down
I'm just me, take it or leave
I'm just trying to be who I was born to be

Yeah my momma always said
Everybody's gonna have their opinion
And just be true to who you are
If you do, then there ain't no competition

'Cause that's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?
'Cause that's what makes you different

Don't need permission
Oh, go ahead and just flaunt it
Oh, when you got it, you got it
And that's what makes you different

You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

Yeah, my momma always said
Everybody's got their own kinda rhythm
That's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?

'Cause that's what makes you different
Don't need permission
Oh, go ahead and just flaunt it
When you got it, you got it
That's what makes you different

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

That's what makes you different

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it

When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it

// Love My Hair //

You want to touch it, don't you?
Try to run your fingers through
Like the weight of your hand
Could ever make you understand
What it feels like to be
A different just like me
You know the weight of your hand
Could never make you understand

The things I'd do to try to fit right in
I'm tired of trying to justify my skin

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair

If I could go back to twelve
I would tell myself
That straight up or down
Baby, that's your crown
Whoever made up those rules
They don't apply to you
A straight up or down
I turn the world around

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair

(I love my, I love my, I love my hair)
(I love my, I love my, I love my hair)

The things I did to try to fit right in
I'll never justify my skin again

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
But I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair

// Lay It On Me //

I feel it in the air
I can see through your smoke and mirrors
Baby, let your heart be naked
I'm right here

Come meet me on other side
And make it rain in this burning house
Pouring down till the Sun comes up
I'm right here

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight

Slow dancin' on a tight rope
I let your walls crash down
No, I ain't tryin' to be your savior
But I'm right here
Oh, I'm right here

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight

Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lay it on me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Lay it on me tonight

(Lay it on me, lay it on me)
(Lay it on me, lay it on me)

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lay it on me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight
Lay it on me tonight

// Higher //

When I'm down
When I'm low
When my wings feel broke
When the stars feel too far to touch
You lift me up

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

When I'm lost in the dark
I just look for your spark
You light me up like the Fourth of July
Like a firework in the sky

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

Higher than a prayer
Higher than the clouds
So high that seeing Heaven
Means that I'm looking down

Higher than the rain
Higher than the sun
So high that when I'm falling
I'm still going up

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

// Dancing In The Living Room //

We can turn the world off
Forget about what's goin' on outside
We can make it all stop
Freeze a little time tonight

Don't need a DJ, a disco ball
No cover charge, no last call
Just pull me close
And let's see where this goes

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

We can put a record on
Spin me like the vinyl, 'round and 'round
Pour the drinks and make 'em strong
Burn up every candle in this house

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Don't need a DJ, a disco ball
If I got you, I got it all
Just pull me close
And let's see where this goes

The lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

// Do You Really Wanna Know //

Really
I've been living in survival mode
Really
I'm just doing my best to be intentional

And don't say, "Hello, how you doing?"
If you don't really care to know
'Cause really
I'll just say I'm good to keep you comfortable

But if I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Really
I've been going twice a week to therapy
Really
Tryna change the way I think about the way I think

I hit rock bottom
Hit the bottle so much harder
It was dark for a minute
(But I'm better for it)

If I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Do you really wanna know?

I'm so used to telling little lies
I'm so used to telling little lies

But if I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Do you really wanna know?

// Words //

I'm not skinny enough
I'm not pretty enough
Feels like the world's on my back

They don't like the songs that I sing
And the man who gave me my ring
May even hate that I'm black

It's so much pressure feeling like I gotta smile and let it go
To keep it all to myself and never let it show

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
Oh, what can I say?
I'm only human

And there's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes I ain't bulletproof
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me

Sometimes they lift you up
Just to pull you back down
And they fill you with doubt

They can tear you apart
Fix up your broken heart
Pick you up off the ground

It's so much pressure feeling like I gotta smile and let it go
To keep it all to myself and never let it show

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
What can I say?
I'm only human

There's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes I ain't bulletproof, oh
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me

If we can love a little more
Hate a little less
Love a little more

If we could love a little more (Hate a little less)
Hate a little less
That we could love a little more, love a little more
Yeah, oh

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
Oh, what can I say?
I'm only human

There's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes, I ain't bulletproof, oh
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me
Words still hurt me

// Smoke //

You say I'm suspicious
All up in your business
Like to call me crazy
When I get to throwing dishes

You say what's my confirmation
Making eggs and bacon
You see me with the skillet
Better quit testing my patience

Baby, go ahead admit it
I just might forgive it
Pushing my buttons, about to push me to my limit
I know, a girl always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke

There's a hot coal match striking
Spark plug switch igniting
Kerosene kinda fire

I'm not over protective
That's just your perspective
I'm just looking out
For the return on my investment

Baby, why are you sweating?
I just got some questions
Are you trying to keep straight
All the lies that you been telling?

Baby, go ahead admit it
I just might forgive it
Pushing my buttons, about to push me to my limit
I know, yeah, a woman always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
There's a grandma chicken grease
Firetruck in the street
Preacher preach kinda fire

Yeah, I know
A woman always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke

There's a fuse lit
Fahrenheit, powder keg, dynamite
Burning man kinda fire

// Indigo //

Overlooked
Underrated
Misunderstood
I'll explain it

Little tired
Not defeated
Not as seen
Just as needed

I'm so glad you came
If you haven't caught my name

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow or pot of gold

Lord knows the rain
Has been brutal
But what we learned
Can be useful

Take my hand
You can do it
It's hard to see the truth
Till the sun is shining through it

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow or pot of gold

We might not look the same
And it's caused a lot of pain
But maybe that can change

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow
Or pot of gold

// If I Were A Boy //

If I were a boy, even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted then go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home, to come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Oh how it feels to love a girl, someday
You'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

But you're just a boy

// Better Than You Left Me (Fly Higher Version) //

You said goodbye
With words cold as ice
I was shaking
Watching you go
I couldn't breathe
No, I just couldn't see
Past you leaving
Me here all alone
It's funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now here you are
Trying to win back my heart
And I bet you
Thought it'd be easy to do
But baby I've changed
Now you get a taste of standing
On the side where you lose
Ain't it funny what a little time does, baby

I'm better than you left me
I'm better than I should be
Better than I was when you walked out that door
I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me

Now I love deeper
And I laugh a little bit louder
I smile brighter
And I fly higher

I'm stronger than the woman
The one that you knew back then
So don't you think I'll take you back
Like every time before
No baby, I don't think you know me anymore
I'm better than you left me
Oh, I'm better than you left me
