// Albatross //

Slow motion
Slow motion
Getting rid of the albatross
Sowing seeds of discontent
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I've seen you up far too close
Getting rid of the albatross
Frying rear blinds
If I wanted
Should I really
If I run away
Run away
Riding along on the crest of the wave
Getting rid of the albatross
Another will not forget
I know you very well
Run away
Run away
Should I
I run away
Getting rid of the albatross
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I see you far too close
If I wanted to
If
Run away
Run away
I ran away
I ran away

// Memories //

You make me feel ashamed
At acting attitudes
Remember ridicule
It should be clear by now
Clear by now
Your words are useless
Full of excuses
False confidence
Someone has used you well
Used you well
I could be wrong
It could be hate
As far as I can see
Clinging desperately
Imagining pretending
No personality
Dragging on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
I think you're slightly late
Slightly late
This person's had enough of useless memories
Always remember
Twisted amenities
Could be wrong
This person's had enough
Of useless memories
Always remember
Twisted amenities
Out of order
Out of order
It could be worse
You're losing all the time
I could be wrong
Could be worse
You're losing all the time
I let you stay too long
I could be wrong
Could be wrong
Whatever pass
Could never last
All in your mind
Where it all began
You're doing wrong
It's not the movies
And you're old

// Swan Lake //

Seeing in your eyes
Words can never say the way
Told me in your eyes
Final in a fade
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes

Never really know, never realize
Silence in your eyes
Silence in your eyes
Never really know, till it's gone away
Never realize
The silence in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes

Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Watch her slowly die
Saw it in her eyes
Choking on a bed
Flowers rotting dead
Seen it in her eyes

Ending in a day
Silence was a way
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
I'm seeing through my eyes

Words cannot express...

// Poptones //

Drive to the forest in a Japanese car 
The smell of rubber on country tar 
Hindsight done me no good 
Standing naked in this back of the woods 

The cassette played poptones 

I can't forget the impression you made 
You left a hole in the back of my head 
I don't like hiding in this foliage and peat 
It's wet and I'm losing my body heat 

The cassette played poptones 

This bleeding heart 
Looking for bodies 
Nearly injured my pride 
Praise picnicking in the British countryside 

Poptones

// Careering //

A face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living
He's been careering
The steady hand as planned
Behind the reasoning
No claim for property
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Is this living
He's been careering
Trigger machinery
Mangle the military
No one should be there
Is this living
Blown into breeze
Scatter concrete
The jagged metal bad life
Manufactured
He's been careering
Is this living
A face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living careering
There must be meaning
Behind the moaning
Spreading tales
Like coffin nails
Is this living
He's been careering
It's raining
I need to hide
Trigger machinery
I've been careering
Across the border
Is this living
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Armoured machinery mangled

// No Birds //

This could be heaven
Shallow spreads of ordered lawns
I like the illusion, illusion of privacy
The careful trees blending so perfectly
Bland planned idle luxury
Life in lovely allotted slots
A token nice, a nice constitution
A layered mass of subtle props

This could be heaven
Mild mannered mews
Well intentioned rules to dignify a daily code
Lawful order standard views
This could be heaven

// The Suit //

It is your character
Deep in your nature
Take one example
Sample and hold
Romance and replace
The lack in yourself
It's your nature

It's your nature
We see you climbing
Improving the effort
Wearing my suit
It is your character

There is a limit
Over your shoulder
Everyone loves you
Until they know you

Perfume aerosols
May champion the strangers
Nick

Standing around
All the right people

Crawling
Tennis on Tuesday
The ladder is long
It is your nature

You've gotta suntan
Football on Sunday
Society boy
On Social Security
It is your nature

Tennis on Tuesday
Sipping champagne
Football on Sunday
Home on the train
It is your nature

Girl from Totteridge Park
Said you were nice
So was my suit
The ladder is long

// Bad Baby //

Nearly ten thirty, I'm rising early
I've got an eye to buy the best
Before the rush
Someone left a baby in the car park
Never any reason
Don't you listen
One more sob story
Someone is calling
Seen through the window
Calling through mirrors
Don't you listen, don't interfere
Ignore it and it will go away

Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listen
Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listen

// Chant //

Voice moaning in a speaker
Never really get too close
Only a gimmick, pointed fingers
Never more serious sight
Wouldn't waste the effort on entertainment
Out of control, mob running wild
All you ever get is all you steal
Side of London that the tourists never see
Angle ambience

Chant

Don't know why I bother
There's nothing in it for me
The more I see the less I get
The likes of you and me are an embarrassment

Chant

It's not important
It's not worth a mention in the Guardian
Every librarian has its theory
Chant chant angle ambience

Chant
Voice moaning in a speaker
Chant
