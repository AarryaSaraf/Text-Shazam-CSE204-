Think you know the answer
Think you got all the problems
Well why not try and solve them
Instead of sitting on them

Solitaire
Solitaire

Taking on new projects
Steadily slipping sideways
Close your ears to reason
Your very valued opinion

Solitaire
Solitaire

Nothing is getting nowhere
Never meaning what you're saying
Well now I need a decision
Not empty headed ambition

Solitaire
Solitaire

Slightest things explode you
Well the whole world will implode you
Solitaire for the lonely fly
You're not the only one

Solitaire 
Lonely fly

For the lonely fly

Think you know the answer
Think you got all the problems
Well why not try and solve them
Instead of sitting on them

Taking on new projects
Steadily slipping sideways
Close your ears to reason
Your very valued opinion

Nothing is getting nowhere
Never meaning what you're saying
Well now I need a decision
Not empty headed ambition

// Bad Life //

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Well, bad life

Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun
That's life

Name of the game
It's competition
Top of the pile
Not demolition

This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Bad life

Now this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one
The open road
I'm getting gasoline

Well, bad life
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument
Well, bad life

Bad life
Bad...
Bad life

Now looking out for number one
The open road
Getting gasoline
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Bad life

Now looking out for number one
The open road
Getting gasoline
Human gets dubious side

Well, bad life
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Well, that's life

Well, that's life

This is what you want
This is what you get

// This Is Not A Love Song //

This is not a love song...

Happy to have, not to have not 
Big business is very wise 
I'm crossing over into 
E-enter-prize 

Love song 
Love song 
Love song 
Love song 

I'm going over to the other side 
I'm happy to have not to have not 
Big business is very wise 
I'm inside free enterprise 

I'm adaptable 
I'm adaptable 

I'm adaptable and I like my new role 
I'm getting better and better 
And I have a new goal 
I'm changing my ways where money applies 

This is not a love song...

Now are you ready to grab the candle 
That tunnel vision - not television 
Behind the curtain - out of the cupboard 
You take the first train - into the big world 
Now will I find you - now will you be there 

Not a love song...

// Tie Me To The Length Of That //

Trials and tribulations

When I was born the doctor didn't like me
He grabbed my ankles
Held me like a turkey
Dear mummy
Why'd you let him hit me
This was wrong
I knew you didn't love me

There is selection
Many shapes and sizes
Variety
Fondling surprises
The syllables
Trigger happy opposites
Encountering those devious devices
Satisfying all that you are craving
Considering life is now worth saving

Tie me to the length of that

Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that

You'll be sorry you don't love me
Something is happening to my body

Nature is those little bits and pieces

Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that

When I was born the doctor didn't like me
He grabbed my ankles
Held me like a turkey
Dear mummy
Why'd you let him hit me
This was wrong
I knew you didn't love me

I keep these feelings deep inside my body
It's not the union both of us expected
Remember daddy
When you made him hold me
Safe in his arms
Then the bastard dropped me

Ooh, ah
Pretty, pretty baby
Pretty baby
Baby, baby boo-hoo...

Tie me to the length of that
Tie me to the length of that
Considering life is now worth saving
Stupid drunk

You'll be sorry you don't love me

Ooh, ah
Pretty, pretty baby
Pretty baby
Baby, baby

Ooh, ah
What a lovely little baby

There is selection
Many shapes and sizes
Variety
Fondling surprises
The syllables
Trigger happy opposites
Encountering those devious devices
Satisfying all that you are craving
Considering life is now worth saving

Tie me to the length of that...

// The Pardon //

I think you need me now
From chapter to chapter
I'll never let go
I have an appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice
...

Admire the scenery
It's where I left it last
This room now has a view
It's nearly night at last
The ceiling seal of ice
These walls and windows have your eyes
Almost a honeymoon
I feel clean inside

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful

I think you need me now
I'm from chapter to chapter
I never let go
I had this appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice

Admire the scenery
It's where I left it last
This room now has a view
It's nearly night at last
The ceiling seal of ice
These walls and windows have your eyes
Almost a honeymoon
I feel clean inside

I'm safe inside this body
Body beautiful
This body beautiful
Body beautiful

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful

// Where Are You //

Hello

Hello

Where are you

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

So now you keep your distance
Double on the nuisance
Avoid the situation
Avoid your occupation
Hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

You're never here when you're needed
Nothing ever heeded
The lying and the faking
The lying and the waiting
It's hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

The lying and pretending
But you don't even try

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

A car without an engine
A plane without a pilot
It's hardly surprising
Too busy socialising
The lying and the faking
Fake
Fake
Fake

Where are you

Where are you now

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you now

// 1981 //

I could be desperate
I think I'm brave
Could stay and watch you
...

You gave me nothing
An early grave
I'm vegetating I want more, more, more
I want everything in 1981

Anywhere
Any place will do
I'm leaving England
We're near the ending
You gave me nothing
No more pretending
I'm looking forward
To our parting in 1981
1981

We're near the ending
I'm just pretending
It's all been said before

I want more, more, more in 1981
1981
1981
You gave me nothing
I want more, more, more
I want everything in 1981

I'm leaving England
We're near the ending
You gave me nothing
No more pretending

1981...
I want everything in 1981
1981...
I want everything in 1981

// The Order Of Death //

This is what you want
This is what you get
...

Here now
Night light
Windows
Waiting
Weakness
Waiting
Silent

This is what you want
This is what you get
...

Guilty
Haunting
Calling
Claiming

This is what you want
This is what you get
...

Here now
Ending
One life
One knife

This is what you want
This is what you get
...
