// One Drop //

I am John and I was born in the London
I am no vulture, this is my culture
The laws of nature, we are lawless and free
We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless
We are the last chance, we are the last dance

One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not drop no proper emotion 
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop

We all go down
The laws of nature, be lawless and free
We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless
We are the last chance, we are the last dance

One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not got no proper emotion 
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion

We come from chaos, you cannot change us
Cannot explain us and that's what makes us
We are the ageless, we are teenagers
We are the focused out of the hopeless

Born in the London, out of London, born in the London
But really we are born everywhere
One drop in all of this ocean
Not gotta be causing commotion
One drop not follow the motion
Not gut no proper emotion 
One drop in all of this ocean
Get proper, follow the motion
Get proper drop of emotion
Not gotta be causing commotion...

// Terra-Gate //

Matters you are, you probably fake
Interrogate into hate operate tomorrow terra-gates
And what you take
What you make
And what you hate you probably fake
Put other [?] like in something to take
And like an [?] one drop at the time
All I could terra into hate

Take what you make what you hate into gray
Into hate, it's too late into fake
What's your gate, what's your gate, what's your gate separates

And if for a million turn to reject
And they expect suffering suffer hate
Separate separate separate separates

Madness you are, interrogate into hate, operate into hate, operate
Tomorrow it's too late
And it's terra into terra-gate

Take what you make what you hate into gray
Into hate, it's too late into fake
What's your gate, what's your gate, what's your gate separates

Separates I know it's time
I'm taking enough friends

Whipping running wanting me out
Like you got something to tell
I like you got to tell are you tearing me out

Swell and well for personality
Will never blondy you through
Not this time, you're in my own time
And I [?] enough now out of you
You can go but you cannot stay, no

I want no more out to you
Another four on the other two
You're too late
You can go now if you want to now
But you cannot stay
You cannot stay
Another you [?]
No wake up in your [?]

And take away into fight share the gate separate
What you may understand tell the gate
Terra hate, terra gater, you go gater separate
Too late

// Human //

None of us are the enemy
And they are the same as you and me
Save for the trick of education
And the parental politician
People what are you doing here?
Who are you listening too, and who are you looking up into?
Are you looking up into?
If these are your leaders, they're not good enough for you

Because I'm human
I've just been thinking
About getting it right

I'm only seeking
And to fight the good fight

I'm only seeking
Because I'm human
Listen to me, they are not good enough for you
Human!
It's like looking across the great divide
Trapped in a class system
It's pushed you all aside
All to the left, all to the right
Your doomed to slip, doomed to slide
Because I think: England's died
Because I think: England's died
Most of all, above the screaming and the poseurs here
I miss the roses
Those English roses, of salad and beer and summer here
And many mannered ways
Of cotton dresses
Skipping across the lawn
Of happy faces, when football was not a yawn
And clear the bomb sites, and all the days were long
November into winters here, snows would turn my page
But school was always torture here
Derision turns to rage
Because I'm human, I've just been thinking
About getting it right

I'm only seeking
Because I'm human

// I Must Be Dreaming //

Well, I've been dreaming, only dreaming
I've just been dreaming

Seems the dreams that I've been in
They are given meaning
In killing feelings and stealing reasons

I've been weak, disgusting thing
A good for nothing
Now I've been believing
Leaving again

Mean giving meaning, believe in dreams
Been stealing feeling
(Dreaming)
I've just been dreaming
(Only dreaming)

I've been in a dream, only dreaming
See imagining waking in a damaging hate
Mistaken meaning
Em, the dead cannot wait

Seen stealings? Feeling the same
Just been dreaming
Dreams can fill you in pain
Can fell a mountain

Cover you in shame
And you know you're to blame
Still feeling the same
Start dreaming again

(Dreaming)
See I've been dreaming
Well, I've been dreaming

(Only dreaming)
Feeling the pain again
(Dreaming)
Again and again, make believing

I've just been dreaming
I've just been dreaming

// It Said That //

It said what
What did it said?
It said that, well, that is a rat!
Ra ta ta
Go gossip that!

It said once, what, what, what, what?
It said that, that was a fact!
It said what?
No! It said that!
It said that
It said that
Like that was a fact
That was not a fact

Oh [?] talking like that
So what?
What did it said?
It said what?
Make it take it back!

So, it said what?
What it said?
It said that!
So, what it said?
What did it said?
It said that!

What did it said?
Ra ta ta ta
That was not a fact
As a matter of fact, make it take it back
[?]
It said what, what did it said?
It said that, oh no!
Now it's not a fact!

You can go shit in that sick
If you listen to that!

// Fool //

Oh... you made a fool out of me
Treated me cooler, oh...
You made it tool, out of me

The e-mails she mails to you
Gossiped you dead, see it's anybody anywhere
Is good as they said
You made a fool, you made it tool, out of me

Pure passion as a matter of fact
Instinct as a physical act
I'll be nothing to you, you made a fool out of me
I am coming back, I know I don't fit in
I am missing to that
All that you do after, you go out
I give him, so I don't kiss this, baby
See you later, baby

You made a fool, out of me
You made it tool, out of me
Please, take me back
Make it, matter of fact
Instinct as a physical act
See, I've been nothing, ain't going back
And I don't fit it [?] tonight
I'm a tool, just a tool under your rule
[?]
Fools get crushed, oh
I can get used to that
Please take me back
Oh...

// Reggie Song //

You see Reginald, he is a reasonable man
And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
He don't see no evil, just Eve and Adam
And only innocence, but in the garden
Acting the, man
He is a new sense
You've been dreaming, we've all been dreaming
We see no reason for leaving the, shine
We trying like, shine
There are no bad seasons, no reason for leaving

And so we shine, so we shine, now shine
You see Reginald, he is a reasonable man
And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
You see Reginald, he is a reasonable man
And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
He don't see no evil, just Eve and Adam
And only innocence, but in the garden

Shining like a beacon in the garden of Eden
There are no bad seasons, no reason for leaving
And if you shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden
No reasons for leaving, shine

He is from London, I am from London
Many of us come from London
But no matter where you come from
You can still be a better person
In the garden of, right in the garden, of

I've been dreaming in the garden of Eden, shine
Got no reason, no reason for leaving, shine
Shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden
I've been seeing no reason of leaving
From the Callie, weed
I have all of the 7 sisters that I need
I am from, park and I am having a luck
And while you wait for the penny to drop
Well you'd rather sing with the world
And you do not know the
He is a ladies' man, he is an innocent man
Back in the garden

And so we like a beacon in the garden of Eden, shine
There are no seasons, no reason for leaving
Shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden, shine
I've been seeing no reason for leaving
I've been dreaming, see no reason

// Out Of The Woods //

Jackson stood 'cause he could
'Cause he should looking good
To the woods and the stood, to the wood understood

Well here we are the unfar
As you are, here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are

Up to the woods as we should
Through the wood, secret would, secret should, secret would understood
Through the wood

And as we march far as far
What last dark from my heart
Secrets could in the woods, through the woods

Jackson could understood they they are
Here we are come too far secrets are
Ready are, ready are, ready are

Well, [?] bullets are, soldiers are, horses are
Jackson could 'cause he should from the wood

Jackson could 'cause he understood the dead I are
And here we are come so far, secrets are, ready are
...
