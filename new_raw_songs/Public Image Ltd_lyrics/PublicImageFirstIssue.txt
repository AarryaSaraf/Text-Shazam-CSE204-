// Theme //

Now I understand

Now I understand
Theme going on and on and on
It's not the same anymore
No, never, never, no 
Wish, wish
And I wish I could die
Now walk alone
Now walk in drain
Does not compute
Not a clichÃ©
And I wish I could die
Random
There is only one reaction
You must never underestimate
And I wish I 
And I wish I could die
Now understand

Now I understand
It doesn't matter no more
Another leap in the dark
I will survive
And I wish I could die
And I wish I could die
And I wish I
I wish I 
I wish I could die
It's only excuses
Never mistaking
Rhyme or reason
No, never, no, never
And I wish I could die
And I wish I 
I wish I could die
I wish I could die
Understand
Theme's going on
On and on and on
I wish I could die

No, never, no, more

Does not compute
Walk alone out of the drain
It's not clichÃ©
Wish I 
Wish
Wish I could die
And I wish I could die
And I wish I could die

On and on and on and on

Will survive
I wish I could die
I will survive
I wish I could die
Understanding doesn't matter no more
Leap in the dark
I will survive
Wish I could die
Wish I could die
I wish I could die
I wish I could die
I wish I could die

I just died
Terminal boredom

// Religion I //

Stained glass windows keep the cold outside while the hypocrites hide inside
With the lies of statues in their minds, where the Christian religion made them blind
Where they hide, a pray to the God of a bitch spelled backwards is dog
Not for one race, one creed, one world
But for money
Effective
Absurd

Do you pray to the Holy Ghost when you suck your host?
Do you read who's dead in the Irish Post?
Do you give away the cash you can't afford?
On bended knees and pray to lord?
Fat pig priest
Sanctimonious smiles
He takes the money, you take the lies
This is religion and Jesus Christ
This is religion, cheaply priced
This is bibles full of libel
This is sin in eternal hymn
This is what they've done
This is your religion
The apostles were eleven
Now there's a sod in Heaven

This is religion
There's a liar on the altar
The sermon never falter 
This is religion
Your religion

// Religion II //

Stained glass windows keep the cold outside
While the hypocrites hide inside
With the lies of statues in their minds
Where the Christian religion made them blind
Where they hide 
And pray to the God of a bitch spelled backwards is 'dog'
Not for one race, one creed, one world
But for money
Effective
Absurd

This is religion
There's a liar on the altar
The sermon never falter 
This is religion

Do you pray to the Holy Ghost when you suck your host?
Do you read who's dead in the Irish Post?
Do you give away the cash you can't afford?
On bended knees and pray to the lord?
Fat pig priest 
Sanctimonious smiles
He takes the money
You take the lies

This is religion
A liar on the altar
Sermon never falter 
This is religion

This is religion and Jesus Christ
This is religion, cheaply priced
This is bibles full of libel
This is sin in eternal hymn
This is what they've done
This is your religion
The apostles were eleven
Now there's a sod in Heaven

This is religion
Liar on the altar
The sermon never falter 
This is religion

This is religion
This is religion
This is religion
This is religion
This is religion
A liar on the altar
A sermon never falter 
This is religion

This is religion
Your religion
And it's all falling to bits gloriously
This is religion

// Annalisa //

Think I'm proud to be your enemy
Take your hands off of me
You're worse than the thing that possessed me
They way they were
The way they should have been
Annalisa

Annalisa was 15 years
Stole her soul
But I hear no tears
Ever been alone 
And heard the voice 
Not your own
I've seen those fears
Annalisa

Somehow you used ignorance for sense
Melodrama in your eyes
All concern rests with the dead
Annalisa

Annalisa had no escape
Starved to death in a waiting room
Cheap concern and rosary beads
Did not solve screaming needs
Annalisa

Annalisa

Annalisa was 15 years
Stole her soul
But I hear no tears
Ever been alone 
And heard the voice 
Not your own
I've seen those fears
Annalisa
Annalisa

Think I'm proud to be your enemy
Take your hands off of me
You're worse than the thing that possessed me
They way they were
The way they should have been
Annalisa

Somehow you used ignorance for sense
Melodrama in your eyes
All concern rests with the dead

Annalisa
Annalisa
Annalisa

Crawl like rabid dog 

Annalisa...

// Public Image //

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, ha ha ha

You never listen to a word that I said 
You only seen me for the clothes that I wear 
Or did the interest go so much deeper?
It must have been the colour of my hair 
The public image

What you wanted was never made clear
Behind the image was ignorance and fear
You hide behind this public machine
You still follow the same old scheme 
Public image 

Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
I will not be treated as property
Public image

Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
It's not a game of monopoly
Public image 

Public image, you got what you wanted 
The public image belongs to me
It's my entrance, my own creation 
My grand finale, my goodbye

Public image
Public image
Goodbye

// Low Life //

Ego-maniac traitor
You never did understand
You fell in love with your ego
It did not fit into plan

Low life

Your alter-ego is a moron
30 years too late
No closet is private
Can see the crack in your face

Low life

Bourgeois anarchist
I read you despise us
Always hurt the one you love
Shit in a drain

Low life

Ego-maniac traitor
You are a fool to yourself
You lie to be distant
Ignorant selfish

Low life

Low life

Ego-maniac traitor
You never did understand
You fell in love with your ego
It did not fit into plan

Low life

Your alter-ego is a moron
30 years too late
No closet is private
See the crack in your face

Low life

Bourgeois anarchist
I read you despise us
Always hurt the one you love
You shit your brain

// Attack //

I can see
I can see when our hands are tied
I was a victim when you lied
Attack
Attack attack attack attack attack
I was a victim of your pride
I will survive 
Attack, attack
You who smile back legislated
You who made me stupid hatred
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack attack
You who made me ignorant
You will face the consequences
Attack

You who sits on golden arses
Tinkering your cocktail glasses
You who smiled so politely
You who make us so unsightly
You who used your money taking
Attack, attack, attack attack attack attack attack
You who tax and persecute
You who guarded all the loot
Attack
Attack
Attack
All our deals confiscated
Legaling with magistrate
Attack
Attack

You who buried me alive
I will survive 
Attack
Attack
Attack
Destroy
Eliminate
Wipe out
Burn
Gave me your manure
Made me insecure
Attack
Attack attack attack attack attack
Attack
Attack

// Fodderstompf //

Be bland
Be dull
Be boring
Be really, really, y'know, nothing, void, zilch, zero, nought, nothing, vacuum
Be in love
We wanted to be loved
We wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Ha ha ha
Oh no
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Love
Oh love
Love
Love makes the world go round
We only wanted to finish the album with the minimum amount of effort which we are now doing very successfully
We only wanted to be loved
We only
Love
We wanted to be accepted by society
We wanted to be accepted
We wanted to be accepted as people
We wanted to be accepted as people
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Love
Love
Love
We wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

I'm just gonna go and get a cigarette, do you want one?
Yes please
Wont be a second
Okay

Be bland
Be dull
Be boring
Be in love

Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Love
Loved
Love

Every time I walk up and down the street
I look at people and I think why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
We only wanted to be loved...

Oh, thank you, wrong end

I'm in love
2, 3, 4
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We need love
We need love like the water we drink
Like the air we breathe, luvy
You know what I mean, like where I come from
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only love can satisfy us
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
No one understands us
Nobody cares
No one loves us
Love makes the world go round
Oh, it does that as well without any mistake whatsoever
Love does make the world go round
I don't know what these punk rockers get up to
Y'know these punk rockers with their spitting and their antics
Don't they realise that love makes the world go around
Don't these punk rockers realise realise that love makes the world go around
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Fucking hell thirsty work in'it being famous
This track is dragging on
Do you think it'll ever end?
One more time?
What did you think of the engineer looking through that glass window?
I think he's rather suspicious
He looks very suspicious to me
Very dubious guy with that long haired hippy roadie next to him
I think these long haired chaps
I don't really think much of them, but don't you like their jokes?
They don't realise that
Love makes the world go 'round

We only wanted to be loved...

I will show our frustration at society by picking up that fire extinguisher over there and spraying it at the mic

We only wanted to be loved
It's true
Oh no
Oh yes!
We only wanted to be loved
Go on John tickle the old Joanna
We only wanted to be loved
Loved, loved, loved, loved
