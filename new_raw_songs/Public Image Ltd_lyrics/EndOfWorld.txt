// Penge //

The path that lends
To the way by the sea
Away from the harbour
Where their eyes cannot see

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

Well hid are the cattle
From the long ship the enemy
All of us are abandoned here
And branded to pity

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

The gods have spoken
You can see them in me
We're all together
In our sandals by the sea

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

Gather little children
Gather around me
Don't tell your parents
They'll steal your destiny

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

// Hawaii //

Falling in our hearts
Here again, Hawaii
We're here, you and me

Aloha (aloha), well hello there
Aloha, Hawaii (hawaii)
Aloha, well hello there
Hawaii

All journeys end
Some begin again
We're here, you and me
Hawaii (hawaii), remember me
I remember you, Hawaii (hawaii)
Hawaii (hawaii), remember me
I remember you, Hawaii

Don't fly too soon
No need to cry, in pain
You are loved
Again again
Hawaii
You and me
All those good times

Aloha (aloha)
Well hello there
Aloha Hawaii (hawaii)
You are loved
Hawaii
Remember me, I remember you
Hawaii, Hawaii
Remember me, I remember you
Aloha (aloha)
Hawaii
