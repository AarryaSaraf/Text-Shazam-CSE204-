// Criminal //

Like a criminal
Did you think it could be like on TV?
Where you could be big in your own movie?
Did real life let you down?
A genuine Pygmalion

(Criminal) Like a criminal
(No) No good to anyone
(Foolish) Gotta get a life and get sensible
(No) No pity, no pardon
Criminal. Just like a criminal
Could've been a factor
Could've been another distracter
Some like it in limousines, I like it in a tractor
Solo, separate, not just one of a crowd
Indifferent to compliment
I leave my funeral ground

(Criminal) Like a criminal

(No) No pity, no pardon
Just a criminal
Haven't got a clue
Cannot comprehend anything you value
I'm probably just like you
Yes, I haven't got a clue
Just let that Judas goat lead you down that narrowing
Path
As affluence is your influence
You'll be of no consequence

(Criminal) Like a criminal
(No) No pity, no pardon
Yes, I haven't got a clue
Just like a criminal
I can not comprehend anything you value
Probably just like you
Yes, I haven't got a clue
I cannot comprehend anything you value

// Death Disco //

Seeing in your eyes
Words can never say the way
Told me in your eyes
Final in a fade
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Never really know
Never realize
Silence in your eyes
Silence in your eyes
Never really know
Till its gone away
Never realize
The silence in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Watch her slowly die
Saw it in her eyes
Choking on a bed
Flowers rotting dead
Seen it in her eyes
Ending in a day
Silence was a way
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
I'm seeing through my eyes
Words cannot express
Words cannot express
Words cannot exp...

// Don't Ask Me //

What you gonna do - when the river runs dry
Put your drills in the mud - death up in the sky
Should have saved those bottles
Should have saved those cans
Shouldn't oughta listen to the plastic man
No more toilet paper - it's gone just like the trees
Do you like the taste of honey - isn't it best without the bees
Be careful what you're doing - you're messing up my life
And if all this world's a cake - then you took too big a slice

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know (I don't know)
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't blame me - I told you so

Read it in the papers - you hear it in the news
Very few listen - a spew without a view
And is it really worth it - you're choking on remote
I see the red tide coming - but we don't even vote
Infection in the greenhouse - dizzy in the clouds
Oily as an ocean - heaven disemboweled
Planning on a future - well lucky for some
Develop your body - but your mind is still a slum

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (well don't ask me)
Don't blame me - I told you so (middle-age)

The product in the packaging
Of multi-layered glam
150 layers of materials
To cover up a sham
Protecting my planet
Wrap it in plastic
This package is product
Perfected eternal
A crap in a cling wrap
I never met yet a prime minister or president
Who told the truth yet

Swimming in the slurry
Burning in the heat
Wind blown is this weather
I eat what you secrete
I climb this highest derrick
This circus has no prayer
No UFO to save us
And do we really care

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (do we really care)
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't blame me - I told you so

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (no UFO to save us)
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (no fun, no religion)
Don't blame me - I told you so

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (climb this highest derrick)
Don't blame me - I told you so

Kiss goodbye to the earth, the sun, the moon

It's easy to deceive a child

// Selfish Rubbish //

Everything in life should be free
Except the bits that belong to me
Sick to death of paying out money
What the hell has this place done for me? Nothing

Give, give, give me everything
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
I want everything, give me everything
I want the lot

There's not much left of this country
Sell it off as a freehold property
And move into a new vicinity

One that does not have a history

If I ruled the world, there'd be no one in it
This place has come apart at the seam
The bulldog's had his day and so have we
We need to see some scenic scenery
No more of this boring misery

If I ruled the world, there'd be no one in it
