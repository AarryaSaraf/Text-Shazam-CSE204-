// What Would I Do Without You //

What Would I Do (Without You)  
(Candy and flowers)
For my Valentine
(Minutes and hours)
You stay on my mind
(Romance and love songs)
I'm down on my knees
(Promise me you'll belong)
Oh to only me

But that's just a start
What I'm trying to say
I'd give you my heart
But it's yours anyway

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
(I love only you)
And nobody else
(With feelings so new)
Like I've never felt
(Come hold my hand)
Aw, get all closer to me
(Cause you understand)
How true love should be

But that's just a start
What I'm trying to say
I'd give you my heart
But it's yours anyway

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you, yeah
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without.....

Your kisses and your tender touch
I love you I love you I love you so much
Baby there's something I want you to know
I'm gonna die if you ever go

What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
It just isn't long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do without you
To me you're the meaning of
The meaning of love
And I'll always be true
Forever with you
Forever's not long enough
What would I do
Without You
What would I do (yeah)

// It's Alright //

(It's alright)
Woooooooh now, let me tell you now
(It's alright)
So many times I sat down and cried
(It's alright)
You know there's no one to dry my weapin' eyes
(It's alright)
Baby I'm so in love with you now
(It's alright)
And yet you broke my heart in two

Although you've gone away,
There's nothin' I can say but "it's alright".
(It's alright)

Baby how could you be so mean?
(It's alright)
You know sometimes I feel like I wanna scream.
(It's alright)
Everytime I hear someone call your name now,
(It's alright)
You know it almost drives me insane.
(It's alright)

You took my love and gone,
And you that we're wrong,
but it's alright (It's alright)
I wanted to keep on saying sure and (It's alright)
You know someday you'll need these arms of mine (It's alright)
I said it make take a long long time (It's alright)
And when things aint what they used to be now (It's alright)
You can bring your fine self home to me

To prove my love is true,
I'll hug and kiss you too,
And I'll say "it's alright" 
(It's alright)

// Lonely Avenue //

Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby with you

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
I could die, I could die, I could die
Because I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

Now my covers they feel like lead
And my pillow it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
I could die, I could die, I could die
Because I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you've left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be a highway bound

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know its all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
I could die, I could die, I could die
I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

// Blackjack //

Ah let me tell you people
About this blackjack game
It's caused me nothing but trouble
And I've only myself to blame
Hey hey hey yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me
My friends don't come around me
Because I've been so blind
I can't even borrow a nickle
Now I've almost lost my mind
Hey hey hey yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me
I sat there with two tens
I thought I'd have some fun
The dealer hit sixteen with a five
Just enough to make twenty one
Hey hey hey yeah yeah
How unlucky can one man be
Well every quarter I get
Yeah, blackjack takes it away from me
