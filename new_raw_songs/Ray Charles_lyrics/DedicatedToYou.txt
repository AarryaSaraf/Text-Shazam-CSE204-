Album: DedicatedToYou

// Hardhearted Hannah //

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough,
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who likes to see men suffer
To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's Hardhearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

They call her Hardhearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Talk about your cold refrigerating mammas
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas
To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em
Is her delight they say.
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like being in Alaska in your B.V.D.'s
That's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah G-A

// Nancy (With The Laughing Face) //

If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case
On Nancy, with the laughing face

She takes the winter and she makes it summer
And summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughing face

Did you ever heard mission bells ringing
Well she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
But I'm sorry for you, the girl has no sister
No girl could ever replace
Nancy, with the laughing face

// Margie //

My little Margie
I'm always thinking of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you so
So don't forget your promise to me
I have bought a home and ring and everything

For Margie
You are my inspiration
Days are never blue
After all is said and done
There is really only one
And Margie, Margie it's you

After all is said and done
There is really only one
And Margie, 
Oh Margie, 
Margie it's you, you, you

// Ruby //

They say, Ruby you're like a dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

They say, Ruby you're like a song
You just don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heartaches for me
Right from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you

I hear your voice and I must come to you (must come to you)
I have no choice, so what else can I do? (what else can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I just don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

(I hear your voice and I must come to you)
(I have no choice, what else can I do?-what can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's you

// Rosetta //

Rosetta, my Rossetta 
In my heart dear there's no one but you

You told me that you loved me
Never leave me for somebody new
You made my whole life a dream
And I pray you make it come true

Rosetta, my Rosetta
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you

Rosetta, woah Rosetta
In my heart dear there's no one but you

You told me that you loved me
Never leave me for somebody new
You made my whole life a dream
And I pray you make it come true

Rosetta, woah Rosetta
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you
Please say I'm the one dear, just for you

// Stella By Starlight //

The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at even tide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight and not a dream
Mmm, my heart and I agree
She's everything on Earth to me

(The murmur of a brook at even tide)
(That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide)

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight and not a dream
Oh, my heart and I agree
She's everything on Earth to me (on  Earth to me)

// Cherry //

Cherry, Cherry, ain't in a shame
That you can't be sweet as your name
Always flirtin', havin' your fun (having your fun)
Never sayin' if I'm the one (if I'm the one)

But if I am, I'll hang around
Till you grow up and settle down
Oh will you (Cherry) while your heart's on a spree
Cherry, save your loving for me
(Cherry, I'll get you yet)

Cherry (Cherry) I say Cherry
Woah, I'll make a bet
Oh, Cherry, Cherry
I'll get you yet

// Candy //

(Candy, Candy)
(It's gonna be just dandy, dandy)

Candy
I call my sugar Candy
Because I'm sweet on Candy
And Candy, she's sweet on me (she's sweet on me)

She understands me
My understanding Candy
And Candy's always handy
When I need sympathy (Need sympathy)

Oh, I wish that there were four of her
So I could love that much, that much more of her
She has taken my complete heart
And I've got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine (make her all mine)

Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine, all mine

The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine
(Candy's all mine)

// Marie //

Marie, the dawn is breaking
Marie, you'll soon be waking
To find your heart is aching
And tears will fall as you recall

The moon, in all its splendor
A kiss, so very tender
The words "Will you surrender
To me?" woah my Marie

The moon, in all its splendor
A kiss, so very tender
The words "Will you surrender
To me?" woah my Marie

Oh, my Marie

// Diane //

I'm in heaven when I see you smile
Smile for me, my Diane
And though everything's dark, all the while
I can see you, Diane

You have lighted the road leading home
Pray for me (my Diane) when you can (my Diane)
But no matter wherever I roam
Smile for me, my Diane

(Smile for me, my Diane)

But no matter wherever I may roam (wherever I roam)
Smile for me, my Diane

// Sweet Georgia Brown //

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, oh so neat, has Sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and want to die for Sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why
You know i don't lie, not much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came, why it's a shame how she cools them down
Men she can't get are men she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet georgia brown

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet, but oh so neat, has Sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and want to die for Sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you just why
You know I wouldn't lie, not much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came, why it's a shame how she cools them down
Men she can't get are men she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown

Brown
