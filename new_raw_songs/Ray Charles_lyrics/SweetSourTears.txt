Album: SweetSourTears

// Cry //

If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's real
Well it's only, false emotion, that you feel
If your heartaches, seems to hang around, too long
And your blues, keep getting blue-er, with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry
(If your heartaches seem to hang around too long)
(And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song)
Well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
Why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry
I said let your hair down, baby go on and cry.

// Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry //

The torch I carry is handsome, it's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals, I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather, I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together, guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy, I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself: "Where is she?"
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops, moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories, remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her, but I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by - oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

// A Tear Fell //

(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue

You know a tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss these teardrops
But I missed you constantly

That's why I'm
(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor
You know they were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door

I said a tear fell when you told me
That the flame in your heart died
Darlin', have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes

You know I'm just a
(A fool am I)
(A fool am I in love)

I said a tear fell when you told me
That the flame in your heart died
Darlin', have I lost you
Like these teardrops from my eyes

I've got to be a
(A fool am I)
But I'm so glad I'm a fool
(A fool am I in love)
I'm a fool in love

// No One To Cry To //

(I need someone to say I do)
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight
No one to tell my troubles to

I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me
Tight
No one to chear me when I'm blue

When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

And you'll need someone, I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper I love you

When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

And you'll need someone, I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper I love you

// You've Got Me Crying Again //

You got me cryin' again
You got me cryin' again
What is this love all about
I'm in and then I'm out

Your kisses right from the start
They came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then
Somebody new looks good to you
You got me cryin' again, just cryin' for you

Your kisses right from the start
They came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then
Somebody new looks good to you
You got me cryin' again, just cryin' for you

// After My Laughter Came Tears //

I laughed the day I saw you leave, I laughed and
Said Id never grieve
But now after my laughter came tears
(after my laughter came tears)

I told my friends, I didnt care, I laughed about
A  whole   affair
But say now after my laughter came tears

My cryin helped me from showin them that I was blue
(listen)
By myself you'll never know what I've been through
(Just what I'm goin through )

My lips conceal a hurtin pain, I  make believe but
All in vain
I said now after my

// Teardrops From My Eyes //

Every time it rains, you know I think of you
And that's the time, well, I feel so blue
When the rain starts to fall
Across my windows pane
And now it's raining teardrops from my eyes

Well if you see clouds here in my eyes
You know it's just because you said goodbye
Although the sun is shining
There's no sunny skies
Because it's raining teardrops from my eyes

Remeber the night you told me
Our love would always be
But I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you came back to me

Every single cloud would dissappear
I'd wear a smile, baby if you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Because I need you so
I tell you it's just raining teardrops from my eyes

Remeber that night you told me
Our love would always be
But I wouldn't be blue and lonely
Well, if you came back to me

Every single cloud, I tell you  would dissappear
And I'd wear a smile, baby if you were here
So baby won't you hurry
'Cause I need you so
To stop this raining teardrops from my eyes
I say it's raining, ooh yeah

// Don't Cry, Baby //

[Chorus:]
Dont cry, baby
Dont cry my little baby
Dry your eyes lets be sweethearts again

Mhh you know I didnt mean
To ever treat you so mean
Come on sweetheart lets try it over again

[Solo Piano]

[Chorus]

Ahhhhh I know you know I didnt  mean
To ever treat you so mean
Why dont you come on sweetheart lets try it over again

// Cry Me A River //

Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue

Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me,

Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me

Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
Told me you were through with me...
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do...
Come on! Come on!

Cry me a river...
Cry me a river...
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you...

// Baby, Don't You Cry //

I say, baby, don't you cry
You know I'll soon discover
One day by and by
That you loved another

No matter what you say
I'm gonna leave you right away
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

Mmm, you know you can't deny
I did my best to please you
But you were so unkind
But still I try to need you

True love that was sincere
You didn't really care
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

And I remember, sweetheart, that it was you not I
Who said that we must part, uh huh
And the time has come to say goodbye
So why do you cry, sweetheart

Hey, hey, baby, don't you cry
Because I'm interfering
You ought to be satisfied
You know I'm gonna keep on caring

Why should you feel blue
I'll tell you, I'm gonna be the one to lose
Baby, baby, don't you cry

Whoa, baby, don't you cry
Because of any hearing
You ought to be satisfied because
I'm gonna keep on caring

Why should you feel blue
You know I'll be the one to lose
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry

// Willow, Weep For Me //

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Left my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide its starry light
So none will see me sighing and crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me
Oh, Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

// I Cried For You //

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

Every road must have a turning
I know that's one thing that you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be

I found a love just a little bit truer
I found a heart just a little bit newer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

Girl, I found a love just a little bit truer now
I found a heart just a little bit newer
Well I cried for you
Woah, and it's your turn to cry over me
