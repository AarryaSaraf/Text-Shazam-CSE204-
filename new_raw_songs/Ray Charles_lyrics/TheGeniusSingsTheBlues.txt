// I'm Movin' On //

I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen
Now pay me no mind
So I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You were flyin' too high for my little sky
So I'm movin' on

Some day baby when you had you play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep on movin', keep rollin' on
I'm through with you too bad you're blue
'Cause I'm movin' on.

Mister engineer take the throttle in hand 
And take me down to that southern land
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
You can ease my mind if you get me there on time
Move on 

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
She's fine as can be and she's waitin' on me
Keep movin' on

I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move
I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move
Whoa move, whoa move
Whoa move, whoa gonna move on 
Keep on movin' every day every night
And all the time baby

I'm gonna move on, I'm gonna move on
Yea, gonna move I'm gonna move on now
I'm gonna move on I'm gonna move
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
And now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm movin' on
Move on baby, move on
I said move on, I said move on,
I said move on, I said move on,
Well I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
I said move on, I said move on
I said move on, I said move on

// Early In The Morning //

Early in the morning and I can't get right, now
Had a little date with my baby last night, now

And it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Hey, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more

Well it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
And I know it's early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
Early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to her girlfriends house, but she was out
I knocked on her fathers door and he began to shout, "Get away from here boy"

Yes, early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning, yeah (early in the morning)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to Dooky Chase's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me and said, "Ray, you sure look beat"

Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
I told 'em it was in the morning, now (early in the morning)
Yeah, early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Yeah, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I had a lot of money when I started out
Can't find my baby now my money run out, now

Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning)
Whoa, it's early in the morning  (early in the morning)
Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning)
Yeah, I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

Yeah, early in the morning (early in the morning, yeah)
I ain't got nothin' but the blues, now

// Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I) //

My mother told me before she passed away,
Said, "Son, when I'm gone, don't forget to pray
'Cause there'll be hard times, Lord those hard times -
Who knows better than I?"

Well I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay the rent;
Talkin' 'about hard times, hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman, Lord, who was always around,
But when I lost my money, she put me down.
Talkin' 'bout hard times, you know those hard times,
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days, there'll be no sorrow
When I pass away,
And no more hard times,
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?

// The Midnight Hour //

The midnight hour has found me lonely
So unhappy as I can be
You left me, yes you left me without a love

Gave you my lovin, everything I owned
That's why it's so shockin' to find you've gone
It's getting me, it's hard to be, without a love

Haven't had no lovin' now since you know when
The way it's got me baby, you know, it's a sin
I haven't got no money and I've lost my friend
All because I fell for you

I don't know why I have to worry
When you left me in a hurry
You've gone and I'm alone without a love

Please believe me, you know I care
I'd follow you most anywhere
But now you've gone and I'm alone, without a love

// Feelin' Sad //

I'll tell the story just once again
The way I love you, darling it's a sin
You mended my heart, you broke once, baby
And now you broken my heart again

Lying on my bed, I'm sick at home
My mother's dead and my father's gone
You said you'd stay here beside me, baby
And now you left and I'm all alone

I was in Korea in '51
I had no love and that was no home
I would send you all my money, baby
And all the time you were doing me wrong

So now goodbye, if you called that home
You left me here, just to cry and moan
I'm about to lose my mind, baby
So why did you have to roam?

Pray with me boys, please pray with me

Mhmmmmm
Mhmmmmm
Mhmmmmm
Mhmmmmm
Mhmmmmm

Hey Lord! I'm feeling sad, I'm feeling sad

// Ray's Blues //

Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes
Just about the break of day
Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow, baby, where your sweet man used to lay

Well baby, it's so lonesome by myself
Well, it's so lonesome, baby
Tired sleeping all by myself
Well, I don't want nobody but my baby
Shouting, my baby's loving somebody else

Oh baby
Won't you please hear my plea?
Hallelujah, I said, oh, oh baby
Won't you please hear my plea?
Well, wherever you may be, darling
Bring your fine self home to me

// I Believe To My Soul //

One of these days, and it won't be long,
You're gonna look for me and I'll be gone
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)

I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now,
You're tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)
Well you're goin' 'round here with your head so hard,
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)

I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
You're tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)
Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say
"Oh, Johnny" when you know my name is Ray
That's why I believe right now(I believe, yes I believe)

I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)
Well I believe to my soul now
You're tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it)

// Nobody Cares //

Well nobody loves me, baby
Nobody seems to care
Well nobody loves me, babe
Nobody seems to care
Well, ever since my mother passed
Nothin' but misery everywhere

Well I ain't got no money, baby
And my best friends have put me down
Hallelujah, I said I ain't got no money, baby
And my best friends have put me down, oh Lord
Well, all of my good-time buddies
Don't even come around

Well, if you listen to me, baby
Maybe I could find a new life in you
Well, if you listen to me, baby child
Maybe I could find a new life in you
Well, if you'll be mine forever, baby
Child, I never can be blue

// Mr. Charles' Blues //

Baby we went last winter
And the ground was covered with snow
Yes we went last winter baby
And the ground was covered with snow
Oh now, I didn't have no money in my pocket darling
Shouted I didn't have no place to go

Well it seems like I was going crazy sometime
I didn't know what to do
Yes it seems like I was going crazy sometime
Baby I didn't know what to do
Yeah, I wake up in the morning
Shout and laid down with the blues

Well I finally got a break baby
Yes and things are coming my way
Yeah, I finally got a break baby
Yes and things are coming my way
I've got money in my pocket darling
Yes I can change clothes everyday

// Some Day Baby //

Oh Lordy Lord, oh Lordy Lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But some day baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So may mornings since you been gone
I been worryin' and grievin' my life alone
But some day baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So many days since you went away
I had to worry both night and day
But some day baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

No boy, I ain't gonna worry my life no more

You on my mind every place I go
How much I love you nobody knows
But some day baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So that's my story, that is all I have to say to you
Goodbye baby and I don't care what you do
But some day baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

// I Wonder Who //

I...I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I've gone
I wonder who gonna be your sweet man when I've gone
I wonder who, baby's, gonna be carryin' my lovin' on

You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find, you know if you find
You know if you find a new love, baby, won't you please tell me so
Well it might break my heart but still I wanna know

And if the flame, I say if the flame
You hear me if the flame, don't you know if the flame
If the flame in your heart only burns true love for me
Well don't you let nobody turn their backs on me

You know when I, I say when I
You know when I, I want you know when I
When I lost my baby, I lost the best friend I ever had
And If I don't find my baby, hey hey hey, it's gonna drive me mad, yeah
