// Smack Dab In The Middle //

Pick me a town in any clime
Where people like, a rockin' time
And stay awake both day and night
Till everybody's feelin good an' right

Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ahh, smack dab in the middle, boys now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Ten Cadillacs, a diamond mill
Ten suits of clothes to dress to kill
A ten room house, some barbecue
And fifty chicks not over twenty-two

Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
Oh, I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ahh, now boys you can see why I wanna be smack dab in the middle now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

One hundred beds with chorus girls
A street that's paved with natural pearls
A wagon load of bonds and stocks
Then open up the door at Fort Knox

Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ahh, now listen boys throw me smack dab in the middle right now
So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul

That's all right!

A lot of bread and gangs of meat
Oodles of butter and somethin' sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ah, picture it
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ahh, throw me now, smack dab in the middle right now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Alright!

// Feudin' And Fightin' //

Feudin' and fussin' and a-fightin,'
Sometimes it gets to be excitin', now
Don't like them ornery neighbors down by the creek
We'll be plumb out of neighbors next week

Grandma, poor ol' grandma
Tell me, why'd they have to shoot poor grandma
She lies in the clover
You see, someone caught her bending over
Pickin' up a daisy!

Feduin' and fussin' and a-fightin'
There is a wrong that needs a rightin'
Let's get that funeral service over
So then we can start in a-feudin' again

Daughter, baby daughter
Poisened all the neighbors chickens
Daughter hadn't oughter
Least 'till she could run like the dickens
They hit her with a shovel

Feudin' and fightin' and a-fussin'
No use a-standin' here a-cussin', now
Let's give our daughter a pistol now that she's four
And go feudin' and fightin' some more

// Two Ton Tessie //

Down in Nashville, Tennessee (oh yeah)
There's a sight you oughta see (oh yeah)
But as long as you can't get down there
I'll tell you all, so listen to me

There's a girl named Tessie Town (oh yeah)
And she weighs about four hundred pounds (oh yeah)
She's fat and fair, but she don't care
'Cause the boys all hang around

They call her Two Ton Tessie from Tennessee
Holds ten sweeties up on her knee
When she does, all the fun begins
When they play tennis on her double-chin

They all answer to her demands
And bring her tires for wedding bands
Well, I just got a little inside tip
They promised her a nightclub on her hip
Yeah, Two Ton Tessie from Nashville, Tennessee 
(She's from Tennessee)

(Every time she struts around) Uh-huh
(She puts on an extra pound) Is that right?
(But it doesn't seem to worry her)
(The weight is making Tessie reknowned)

(Is a-trying to reduce)
(And she's got a good excuse)
(Fat and fair, but she don't care)
('Cause the boys all hang around)

(They call her) Two Ton Tessie from Tennessee
Goes in swimming up to her knee
Once she went in to her neck
The tide rose up and made the town a wreck

She was hit on the railroad track
Engines hit her and bounced right back
Her appendix had to come out fast
They couldn't operate, so they had to blast
On Two Ton Tessie from Nashville, Tennessee
(She's from Tennessee)

On a streetcar I heard 'em say
Six men gave her a seat one day
All the baseball players have stopped their gym
They run around Tessie just to stay in trim
Two ton Tessie from Knoxville, I mean a-Memphis
Oh-ah, Nashville, Tennessee

(She's from Tennessee)
A-that's right!

// I Never See Maggie Alone //

Maggie dear, just won't go out alone
Seems that she must have a chaperone
When we go out no matter where we're bound
There's always somebody around

She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her brother
Woah, I never see Maggie alone
She brings her uncle, her cousin
She's got âem by the dozens
You know that's why I never see Maggie alone

And if I phone her, say to her "Sweet, 
Where shall we meet, supposing we eat."
She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her brother
Oh! I can never, never see my Maggie alone

She brings her father, her mother
Her sister and her big big brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone
One night when we were out walking
And she got tired of talking
She invited me up to her home

I turned the lights down, they were too bright
Oh! What a sight when I turned on the light
There was her father, her mother
Her sister and her big, fat brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone

I bought a roadster, two-seated
I even had it heated
So that I could see Maggie alone
While we were riding, and kissing
The engine started missing
And we were a long way from home

I got right out and then fast as I could
Found what was wrong, for when I raised the hood
There was her father, her mother
Her sister and her big, fat brother
Oh! I never see Maggie alone

I never
Oh I never
Ow, I never see my little Maggie alone
Oh, Maggie

// Move It On Over //

Came in last night at half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
Get it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over little dog 'cause the big dog's moving in

She's changed the lock on our front door
My door key don't fit no more
So get it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over good dog 'cause the bad dog's moving in

This dog house here is mighty small
But it's better than no house at all
So skid it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over old dog 'cause a new dog's moving in

Now listen here pup, before you whine
That side's yours and this side's mine
So shove it on over (move it on over)
I said move it on over (move it on over)
Move over cold dog 'cause a hot dog's moving in
Move over skinny dog 'cause a fat dog's moving in
Move over cold dog 'cause a hot dog's moving in
Let's go home

// Ma (She's Making Eyes At Me) //

Ma, she's making eyes at me
Ma, she looks so good to me
Ma, she's almost breaking my heart
I'm beside her, please let her conscience guide her

Ma, she wants to marry me
Be my honey bee
Every minute she gets bolder
Now she's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, the girl's kissing me

Ma, she don't look good to me
Ma, her waist is 53
Ma, she's almost ruined my car
When we go out the tires all begin to blow out

Ma, she wants to marry me
You know that could never be
Suppose a baby should come later
It's got to look like an alligator
Ma, won't don't you rescue me, hey

Ma, I found out she's got dough
Ma, the girl owns the B&O
She just bought eight city blocks
In New York City
You know, all at once the girl looks pretty

Ma, if I would say "I do"
She would promise to
Make my future very pleasant
Fort Knox would be my wedding present
Ma, she looks good to me

Buy me the seven seas to swim in
Replace the fish with gorgeous women
Ma, she looks good to me
Ma, she looks good to me

// The Thing //

While I was walking down the beach one bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box a-floating in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
I discovered a * * * right before my eyes
I tell y'all, I discovered a * * * right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
"Ooh, get out of here with that * * * before I call a cop!
Son, get out of here with that * * * before I call a cop!" 

I turned around and got right out, a-running for my life
And then I took it home with me to give it to my wife
And this is what she said at me as I walked in the door:
"Ooh, get out of here with that * * * and don't come back no more!
Please, get out of here with that * * * and don't come back no more!"

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was looking for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing. He was a desperate man
But when I showed him the * * *, he turned around and ran
You know, when I showed him the * * *, he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many year, a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon Saint Peter at the Gate
And when I tried to take it inside, he told me where to go:
"Get out of here with that * * *, and take it down below!
Ray, get out of here with that * * *, and take it down below!"

The moral of this story is if you're out on the beach
And you should see a great big box and it's within your reach
Don't ever stop and open it up. That's my advice to you
'Cause you'll never get rid of the * * *, no matter what you do
I tell you, you'll never get rid of the * * *, no matter what you do

// The Man With The Weird Beard //

(Beaver)
(Beaver)

Straggly raggly hair on his chin
Battered and tattered and ugly as sin
Eagle-eyed and floppy-eared
He's the man with the weird beard

Who is he, what is he, nobody knows
Both of his heels are as bare as his toes
Never had his whiskers sheared
He's the man with the weird beard

It ain't black
It ain't white
It ain't short, it ain't long
It just ain't right
It's the craziest garden of hair
Seven robins live in there

Walk with him, talk with him
What do you find?
More on his chin
Than he's got on his mind
And that's the story that I heared
'Bout the man with the weird beard

(Beaver)
(Beaver)

(Straggly raggly hair on his chin)
(Battered and tettered and ugly as sin)
(Eagle-eyed and floppy-eared)
(He's the man with the weird beard)

(Who is he what is he, nobody knows)
(Both of his heels are as bare as his toes)
(Never had his whiskers sheared)
(He's the man with the weird beard)

It ain't green (no)
It ain't gray (no)
It ain't oats, it ain't corn
It ain't hay (nay nay)
It's a jungle that hangs from his ears
He ain't seen his feet for years

Look at him, look at him
Dressed in his best
Wearin' a beaver
Instead of a vest
You ain't lived until you've heared
'Bout the man with the weird beard

I said the man with the weird beard
I mean the man with the weird beard
I said the man with the weird beard

(Beaver)
(Beaver)
(Ow)

// The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane //

The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has hit the town like a bomb
The back-fence gossip ain't been this good
Since Mabel ran off with Tom

Our town was peaceful and quiet
Before she came on the scene
The lady has started a riot
Disturbin' the suburban routine

I mean that naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Me-oh my-oh, what a girl

You should she how she carries on
With her admirers galore
She must be givin' them quite a thrill
The way they flock to her door

She throws those come-hither glances
At every Tom, Dick and Joe
When offered some liquid refreshments
The lady never, never says no

The naughty lady of Shady Lane
Has the town in a whirl
I mean the naughty lady of Shady Lane
Me-oh my-oh, what a girl

The things they're trying to pin on her
Won't hold much water, for sure
Beneath the powder and fancy lace
There beats a heart sweet and pure

She just needs someone to change her
Then she'll be nice as can be
If you're in the neighborhood, stranger
You're welcome to drop in and see

The naughty lady of Shady Lane
So delightful to hold
So delectable
Quite respectable
And she's only nine days old

// Who Cares (For Me) //

As I walked down this old lonely street
Well it seems like No one seen to wanna speak
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

All the world seem cold, everything is gray
Nothin' seems the same since you went away
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Oh why can't I be set free

All I want is you, all I need is you
But somehow I know that this just can't be
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely there's someone for me
Must I go through life with this hopeless love
Oh why can't I be set free

All I want is you, all I need is you
But somehow I know that this just can't be
Oh who cares, oh who cares
For me

(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
(Who who cares)
