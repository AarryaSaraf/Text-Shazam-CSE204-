// Lift Every Voice And Sing //

I got something in my bones
Make me wanna shout "Hallelujah"
And when I sing it, sing on
I sing on
Woo, Lord help me

Lift every voice and sing, 'til earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea
Come on, y'all
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us
Hey, facing the rising sun, oh, of the new day begun
And let us march on 'til the victory's won

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears
Thou Who hast brought us thus far along the way
Thou Who hast by Thy might led us into the light
And keep us forever, oh, in the path we pray
One more time, y'all
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee
My Lord, my God
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee
Help me, oh
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand
True to our God and true to our native land

Facing the rising sun of the new day begun
And let us march on 'til our victory is won
Amen, Amen

// Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong //

Another day has come and gone, twenty-four hours
In a world where I don't belong
Another week has passed me by
And it's not because I didn't try

Lord knows, I keep on trying but nobody saw me walking, nobody
And I know nobody heard me talking, I don't know why
I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
Yeah, I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Yeah, mhm

Another job that I can't get
A nice apartment where the landlord just won't rent
And I go to bed, but my sleep won't come, oh, oh, oh
My body's empty and my soul is numb

Sad news, nobody saw me walking, oh no, no, no
Nobody heard me talking
Tell me why I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Little old me, mhm

Yeah, hey, yeah
I'm just a number and not a man
So if I'm crazy, well, heh, who's to blame?

No, not me, when nobody saw me walking, no, no
Nobody heard me talking
I believe I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me

Lord, hear me now
Oh, I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Yeah, they must be blind (Ain't it a shame?)
When I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before the people notice me
I hope you don't mind if I say this one more time
Come on and help me, y'all
I gotta do wrong (Yeah), I gotta do wrong (Yeah)
I gotta do wrong (Yeah) before they notice me
Ah, maybe don't see me out there (Keep on singing the song)
I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me

// There'll Be No Peace Without All Men As One //

What good is the sun
If there was no sky above
Why should the rivers flow
Why should a candle glow

There'll be no peace without all men as one

What could all the leaves
If there no trees to grow
Why should a flower bloom
Soon there may be no moon, oh no, how can you know

There'll be no peace without all men as one

Well, there'll be no songs to sing, there'll be no songs to sing
Oh oh oh, there'll be no bells to ring
And you know, no shout 'til I will play
There'll be no night and day

There'll be no peace without all men as one

Now, if time would stop
Then, why should clocks keep time
Tell me, why should the wind lose chime
And I want to know, why should fires burn, I don't know
But I noticed

There'll be no peace without all men as one

// Hey Mister //

Oh, listen, everybody, I got an idea
I think we oughta write a letter to the Congress of the United States
And tell 'em what's on our minds
Because we're the richest country in the world
And I just can't understand why we got so many hungry people
You know, I believe we oughta say something like this

Hey mister, you better listen
Well, mister, you better listen
Mama got to wash the rich folk clothes
Just to keep the rent man from throwing us out the doors
Papa look for work with the morning sun
But tell me, how can you find a job when there just ain't none?

Now, hey legislation, if you can fix the nation, huh
Why don't you open up your hearts and listen to this part
Wait a minute
A little child asked for bread with tears in his eyes
Mama said, "We ain't got none," and then they both cried
Don't you hear 'em? I said don't you hear 'em?
Damn it, don't you hear 'em?
Well then, what the hell is wrong with you then? Huh
Listen

The world need love, I know you admit it
What you're doin' to the poor man, huh
Lord knows you oughta quit it
How can he love you? Tell me, how can smile
When back at home, there's a hungry little child

Hey legislation, why don't you try a new route
Listen to the people, and hear what they talkin' 'bout
You see, the poor people know that they can't impeach you, oh no
They just hopin' that their cries will reach you
Now don't you hear 'em? I said don't you hear 'em?
Well then, I feel sorry for you if you don't

'Cause many singers before me have sung this song
Tryin' to remind you to right this wrong
But what I'm wondering, if you ever understand
That rich or poor, a man's still a man

Now, hey legislation, when you start to fix the nation
Take a real good look at the present administration
And then stand up, wave it goodbye
Find someone who can hear the people cry
Lord knows you oughta hear 'em
I ain't lyin', you need to hear 'em, man
You better hear 'em
Somethin' might go wrong, you better hear 'em, oh

Hey mister, what you gon' do?
Hey, the people out here tryna talk to you
You know we need help and we ain't gonna wait
Now, don't talk, get to doin' before it's too late
You see, I understand foreign aid is well and good
But why don't you give some of that money to the neighborhood
Lord have mercy
Oh, can't keep living down here in mud
And I know you're sick and tired of looking at blood
Well, mister, you better listen
Yeah, oh, mister, you better listen
Oh mister, you better listen
Oh mister, you better listen to me
I'm tryna tell you somethin', man

// What Have They Done To My Song, Ma //

Hello mama, hello mama, it's me
How you feelin', mama? Mhm, that's alright
I've got something I wanna talk to you about, if you don't mind
And I ain't mad, mama, no, no, no, no
Wait a minute, listen, mama

Look what they done to my song, mama

[*French*]
Ooh, not bad (Ma), hey, yeah

Look what they done to my song (Look at it, look at it), mama
Hey ma, look what they done to my song, mama, now, oh Lord, Lord
Put it in a plastic bag, then they turned the bag upside down
Look what they done to my song

Maybe it's alright, maybe it's okay, I don't know
But I tell you, if my kids are money, I'd be a millionaire today
You know, the only thing I get to have right
Now it's turning out all wrong, mama
You can't believe what they done to my song, ma, that I wrote myself
You put it in a plastic bag and they turn the bag upside down, ma
Lord, if I could find a good book, I'd never have to come out and look at the
What they tryin' to do to my brain, it's a shame, mama, you see they
They done picked it like a chicken bone and I'm just about to go insane
I'm insane, insane, mama, I'm going crazy, mama, that's what it is
Lord knows I don't care what they done to my song, ma
No, I don't care 'bout that but see
The main thing, mama, what they tryin' to do to me
You see, they, they, they, well, they stole everything I had, mama
And they made a million with it, and you know that hurts
But oh, I'm gon' keep on working on the feeling, just like you taught me, mama
Oh, yes, I will, oh, yes, I will, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Lord, Lord, whoa, mama
Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama

// Abraham, Martin And John //

He freed a lotta people, but the good, they die young
'Cause I looked around one day and man was gone
What a shame, he was gone
Listen

Anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where the man gone? Uh-huh, now, now, now
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I turned my head one day, the man was gone

Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Ooh, can you tell me where he's gone?
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee

// Take Me Home, Country Roads //

Listen here (Go 'head)

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads

Now wait a minute
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me (Calls me)
The radio reminds me of my home far away (Home sweet home)
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
(Now, hold on, you got it)

All my memories, gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop from my eye

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads
(Ah, I like that) Me, too

(Hey man, you gon' give me some of this thing again?) You know it
(Well, let me hear ya) Right on

Country roads, why don't you take me home to the place I belong
Oh, West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads

(Now put your hands together)
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
Hey, hey, West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads
(Let's do it again, y'all)
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, please take me home, country roads
(That's alright, y'all)

// Every Saturday Night //

Every Saturday night, y'all, 'bout sundown
Country people in wagons, they be coming from miles around
And they're drinking corn liquor from a Mason fruit jar
And old men keep plucking, plucking that bass string guitar

Good ol' pig feet and barbecue (Pig feet and barbecue)
Good ol' catfish and homemade brew
And I got me some butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Every Saturday night, y'all, y'all, y'all

Let me hear
Every Saturday night, I get in my sin
And as long as I'm able, I'm gon' the same thing again, y'all know that, don't you?
My head gets so bad, it's a doggone shame
Y'all know I be so tore down, I don't even know my name

Good ol' pig feet, y'all (Pig feet and barbecue)
Oh, good ol' catfish and homemade brew
I have me some butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Oh, every Saturday night

Wait a minute
Monday morning (Monday) is the day I plow (Hey, hey)
And then Tuesday (Tuesday), I gotta milk the cow, y'all know about that, don't you? (Hey, hey)
Whoa, Wednesday (Wednesday), I have to walk the dog (Hey, hey)
Then Thursday (Thursday), I gotta slop the hog, now I ain't ashamed (Hey, hey)
Oh, Friday (Friday), good Friday (Friday)
Girls, what's the sixth day of the week? (Friday) Oh, Friday (Friday)
Woo, Friday (Friday), when my work is done (Friday)
I realize I've got one more night before Saturday comes

Good ol' pig feet, y'all (Pig feet and barbecue)
Good ol' catfish and homemade brew
Nothing like Oklahoma chalk, is it, though
With butter beans and chitterlings too (Butter beans and chitterlings too)
Oh, every Saturday night

Standard meal, there's enough to go around
'Cause we be doing it
All night long
Come Sunday morning, I still be going strong
Yes, I do, come on
Yeah, and let yourself go
Every Saturday night
You know we gon' lock it down
Do it
Yeah, ain't nothing wrong with it
Get it, oh

// America The Beautiful //

Oh beautiful, for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self, our country loved
And mercy more than life

America, America, may God thy gold refine
'Til all success be nobleness
And every gain devined
And you know when I was in school
We used to sing it something like this, listen here

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about

America, sweet America
You know, God done shed his grace on thee
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in a brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this

(America, America)
America, I love you America, you see
(God shed his grace on thee)
My God, He done shed his grace on thee
And you oughta love Him for it
Because He, He, He, He, crowned thy good
He told me He would, with a brotherhood
(From sea to shining sea)
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord
(Shining sea)
