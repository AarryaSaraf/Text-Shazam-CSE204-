Album: DaysAreGone

// Forever //

Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see
It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention and I need you to know that

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know know know

Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

I don't want to turn around
So come on baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let go
We're still the same
So come on baby
Trigger the sound, let's figure it out
Let's get back to where we started out

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know know know

Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory
No no no not tonight, I don't have the energy

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory
No no no not tonight, oh not tonight, oh not tonight

Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

// Go Slow //

Go slow
So that I can hear everything you're saying.
Now I know you're going.
You just threw this away.
You know I ain't gonna take it.

Go slow.
Make me you're gonna make it.
I know.
I can't make you stay.
But I'll be hurting from the heat.
Hurtin' from the heat.

Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
Going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From the heat now.
Oh I just wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.
From your heat it's coming, coming.

I know.
I'm giving in and believing every lie.
For now, the moon, it's night.
I turn off the light.
But you shook up the foundation.
Go slow.
Now.
With your intimidation.
I know.
You turn away now I'll be hurting from the heat.
Heat.
Hurtin' from the heat.

Well, well, was it something that I said.
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
I'm going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From your heat now.
Oh I wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.
From your heat it's coming, coming.

From the heat now.
From the heat now, now, now, now.

Well, well, was it something that I said.
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
Well, I'm going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From your heat now.
Oh I wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.

Go back...
Go back...

From your heat now.
I just wanna go back. Go back. Go back.

Go back...
Go back...

// Falling //

I give a little
Into the moment like I'm standing at the edge (I know)
That no one's gonna turn me 'round
Just one more step, I could let go

Oh and in the middle,
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now (I know)
And nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling,
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no it's never enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

But now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

Now we're going down,
And I can feel the eyes are watching us so closely oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling,
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no it's never enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

But now I'm falling
Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(But now I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feeling tired, hungry too
(I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling
(I'm falling)

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(But now I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feeling tired, hungry too
(I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling
(Now I'm falling)

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, Falling, falling, oh
Oh and now I'm falling

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling, oh

Falling, falling, falling, falling
Fall yeah
And now I'm falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling
Fall yeah
And now I'm falling

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feeling tired, hungry too
(But now I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling for me
(I'm falling)

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(Now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feeling tired, hungry too
(Now I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling for me

Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up
I'll never give up
[6x]

// The Wire //

You know I'm bad at communication, it's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said, it's the most important part that relationships will go through
And I'd give it all away
Just so I could say
That I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

You know there's no rhyme or reason for the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say
It but I can't bear to stay
And I just know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled him when I came down to the wire

Does your imagination try to make you what you wanted to be?
Because I'm sorry I do what I did, but it came naturally
And I gave it all away
Just so I could say
That, well, I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Well, I try to keep myself together,
After all the opportunities
I try to stay true to you and try to do what you wanted for me
And I'd give it all away
Just to hear you say
That, well, I know, I know, I know, I know that you're gonna be OK anyway

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
Ooh, yeah

Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight,
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

But I just couldn't take it,
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

It felt right, it felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
It felt right
It felt right
It felt right
No, no, no, no
But I fumbled it when I came down to the wire

// If I Could Change Your Mind //

[Verse:]
No, please don't cry
I've never done this before, drove a million miles
Back, when you were mine
I was too young to know you were the one to find

[Bridge:]
But if I was to say I regret it
Would it mean a thing?
Cause every time I think (I think) think about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

[Chorus:]
If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

[Verse:]
Now I won't go
I won't run away this time
But all I wanna know

[Bridge:]
But if I was to say I'll forget it
Would it mean a thing?
Cause every time I think (I think) about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love remind me

[Chorus]

Visions of our love remind me
(If could change your mind)
Visions of our love remind me
(It took time to realize)
Visions of our love remind me
(Forgive my lying eyes)
Visions of our love remind me
(If I could change your mind, I could make you mine...)

// Honey & I //

Goodnight
I know there's nothing good in goodbye
But you lead me to no other line
No other line
Eyes wild
When you walked through the door
You made your way across the floor
And all the little girls had to try their turns
Try their turns

No, no, no, no
See, I'm not afraid no more
(I'm not afraid no more)
To turn you away no more
(Turn you away no more)
To turn you away, to turn you away

'Cause my honey and I, yeah, yeah
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I (Honey and I)
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now

Oh, no, no, no, no, no
No, no
I don't love you just because
Love wasn't what I thought it once was
But I thought it once was
Telling each other everything
Picking out your wedding rings
No, now I know and now I see
I'm not afraid no more
No, no, no, no, no, no

So why are you always trying to stay at home?
(Why are you staying there?)
This song can't be played alone
(This song can't be played alone)
It was made to be played with my

Honey and I, yeah, yeah
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I (Honey and I)
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now

Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Ha, ha, ha, yeah
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh (oh oh)
Ah, ha, ha, yeah

My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I (oh)
My, my, my honey and I

Oh, no, no, no
See, I'm not afraid no more
No more, to turn you away
To turn you away
'Cause my...
No, no, no, no, no, no

D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now
D-d-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now
D-doing just-a fine now

// Don't Save Me //

Never thought that I would grow so old of seeing the gold
Still I never want it to go
I would hold it up to my cold heart
Feel the way it used to start up

Take me back, take, take
Take me back to the way that I was before
Hungry for what was to come
Now I'm longing for the way I was

You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will, oh-oh

Take me back
Give it up, give it up to me
Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
See I wanna know
Give me, give me all your love
If you can't hold on
Then baby, baby don't save me now
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
No, no

All my life I wasn't trying to get on a highway
I was wondering which way to go
Spending all of my damn time
Leaving all the weight behind you

Take me back, take take
Take me back to the song how it used to go oh-oh
Screaming for what was to come
Now I'm dreaming 'bout the way I was

You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will save me
You say you will, say you will, oh-oh

Take me back
Give it up, give it up to me
Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
See I wanna know
Give me, give me all your love
If you can't hold on
Then baby, baby don't save me now
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
No, no

And if I have to beg for your love
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
Oh, will it ever be enough?
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
And if I have to beg for your love
(Again, and again and again)
Tell me, tell me
Oh, will it ever be enough?
(Again, and again and again)

So, baby don't save me
No, baby don't save me
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Baby, don't save me now
(Again, and again and again)
(If your love isn't strong)
Don't save me
(Again, and again and again)
Don't save me
(Again, and again and again)

// Days Are Gone //

And I got back up
When I lost control over it all, over it all
And I knew that I couldn't take no more
Cause I want it all, I want it all
All the times I've said it
All the times I've said it before
Those days are gone
Cause you didn't know how
And I know that now
I want it all, I want it all

Felt like I was walking on a tight rope
Those days are gone, those days are gone
Sometimes I wish I didn't miss you at all
Those days are gone
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
And now I'm waiting for the day to dawn
Those days are gone

I remember when you found it hard to give
But I gave it all, I gave you my all
You only took one side
When all my hopes ran dry
Those dreams are gone, gone all along
All the times I said it
All the times I've said it before
I'm moving on
You can have my past, I'll never get that back
I'm moving on, cause those days are gone

Felt like I was walking on a tight rope
Those days are gone, those days are gone
Sometimes I wish I didn't miss you at all
Those days are gone
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
And now I'm waiting for the day to dawn
Those days are gone

Days are gone, days are gone (haa)
Days are gone, days are gone (haa)
All my love that I can't hide
All my love now you can't find it
Those day are gone
Those day are gone
Those day are gone
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Those days are gone
Those day are gone

// My Song 5 //

I found it hard
Tried to reserve
I'll get it right
When I am hurt

(hot for me)
The man's his own
(hot for me)
To her he'll go
(hot for me)
But I'll be fine
(hot for me)
'Cause I know

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to
So what's the truth?
Now I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you
I've been dying to know what you've tried
You've been lying
So, honey, I'm not your honey pie

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up, going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

If you want to take me, baby, please
Been holding on for eternity
Save you only for me
Missing you never led to much of anything

If you wanna know, if you wanna show me
What it means, what it seems, seems to be
Held by a thread
Tried to forget
But I'll never let it go

Honey, I'm not your honey pie

Tried to lie, dying
Hear all lies, trying
Tried to lie, dying
Hear all lies, trying

He's in her heart on the floor
Thinking that I'll never know
I'll be up, going through
Crazy shit I did for you
In my mind, in my head
Seeing all the words unsaid
Honey, honey, I am never coming home again

I've been lied to
So, what's the truth?
No, I'm not gonna hide it all, keep it in all from you
I've been dying to
Know what you've tried
You've been lying
So, honey, I'm not your honey pie

// Let Me Go //

Get me out,
Give me in,
I gave you everything I could give.
You try to take,
And you try to make it,
but take all everything you can't break.

If you go so easily,
Go on, get out, when you leave,
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me out,
Let me in,
I've giving up, not giving in.
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing.
We're holding on, and on.

Together now, forever then.
Go ahead, don't you let me in.
But I will wait, and I will want.
Wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me go.
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
I know I'm nothing without your love, no.
So let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
I know I'm nothing without your love.
So please, God, let me go.

Let me out,
Let me in.
I gave you everything I could give.
You try to take,
you try to make,
You take all everything you can't make.

If you go so easily,
Go on, get out, when you leave,
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let it out,
Let it in.
I'm giving up, not giving in,
'Cause together we are not one, we are nothing, holdin' on and on.

Together now, forever then.
Go ahead, don't you let me in.
I will wait, I will want, wait 'til the day you're back again.

Let me go.
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
You know that I'm nothing without your love, no.
You know I'm nothing without your love, no.
'Cause you know that I'm not one for leaving,
No, I'm not one for leaving,

But I'll go on believing, hey, I'll go on believing.
And I'm not one for leaving, no, I'm not for leaving,
No, I'm not one for leaving, no, I'm not one for leaving.
So let me go.

You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
You know I'm not one for leaving.
Let me go.
(Let me go)
Let me go.
(Let me go)
Let me go.

// Running If You Call My Name //

I went back to a room
And every memory came rushing back too soon
As I packed my bags and I lied down
I felt the bed sink in and the covers surround (I let go (oh))
Cause with my eyes closed I see the door open wide (oh)
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

Jumped back in a daze
I saw the faces slowly slowly slip away
Let me hide your eyes, it's too bright
And now I'm slipping through the white
Bringing me into cold dark night
And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
And I, I will run away if you call my name
I, oh, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide
(I'll keep running if you come my way)
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind

I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
I will run away if you call my name
And I, I'll keep running if you come my way
When you come my way
I'll keep running if you come my way

Keep keep running if you call my name
I'll keep running if you call my name

// Send Me Down //

You came back,
Back into my arms
Like a heart attack-tack,
With your certain charms
Coming right through my eyes
Over my body, a hand on my thigh,
And I wanna make nice
Now that you're back to me,
And I wanna do right by you,
With my whole being
C'mon baby, while I was star-gazing
You were with the other one,
but now

Cover your eyes, do I feel right darling?
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line!
So send me down
Ooooh ooh eeh oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh eh oh
Gonna send me down
Ooooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh oh oh.

Back then, back when I could see
You were my only friend,
I was too scared that
I couldn't let you in,
Like a gambler
Only playing to win.

Cover your eyes, do I feel right
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line!
So send me down
Ooooh ooh eeh oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh eh oh
Send me down
Ooooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Ooooh oh oh oh.

No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me
No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me
No, no enough is enough
If you're willing too
Because you're right for me

I don't wanna run
Back to the way we were
I don't wanna run
Back to the way we were
Send me down
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh
Send me down
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh.
So, send me down!
Oh oooh oh oh ye oh
I wanna push you around
Oooh oh oh ey oh.

// Edge //

I was always running, always hurt
But I couldn't let it go, it was too hard to get going
And I kept hoping that you would run first
I couldn't let it go, you were too good to know

You were my own
The memories hold
They're overgrown

But now I know
There's no climbing over
Because I know you'll never see me through

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Oh, you know you could've had it all
But you want me like your crown
And it seemed your favorite thing to do
Was to keep me in the dark and turned around

You can say I'm crazy for giving up
You can wave your sayings like a flag
You can wave it high over your head
You can sing your song to bring me down

You were my own
The memories hold
They're over grown

Mo-ments of the past
have dimmed too much to bring us back

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no I can't fight it off (Over and over, over and over)

No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no, I can't fight it off
No I can't, no I can't fight it off (Over and over, over and over)
[repeat through next chorus]

Well, I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
And I can't fight it off, I can't fight it off

Edge of what could be [x6]

// Falling (Duke Dumont Remix) //

I give a little
Into the moment like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go

Oh, and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

Now I'm going down
And I can feel the eyes are watching us so closely, oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling
Don't stop, no I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough

Oh, but now I'm falling

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feed the tired hungry tooth (I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling away, I can hear them calling for me (But now I'm falling)

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feed the tired hungry tooth (I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling away, I can hear them calling for me

But now I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

And now I'm falling, falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

And now I'm falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, yeah
But now I'm falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, yeah

Oh, and now I'm falling

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (And now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning, yeah (I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feed the tired hungry tooth (But now I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling away, I can hear them calling for me (I'm falling)

Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning, yeah (I'm falling)
Feeling desire, feed the tired hungry tooth (But now I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling away, I can hear them calling for me

Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, never give up

Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, never give up
