Album: SomethingToTellYou

// Want You Back //

Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

I said we were opposite lovers
(Said it from the beginning)
You kept trying to prove me wrong
(Said you'd always see it through)
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

And I had a fear of forgiveness
(Said it from the beginning)
I was too proud to say I was wrong
(Said you'd always see me through)
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now

But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
(Just know that I want you back, baby)

Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
(Just know that I want you back, baby)
(Just know that I want you)
(Just know that I want you back, baby)
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

// Nothing's Wrong //

Counting the hours
With nothing to say
Going though the motions
It's slipping away
We were so gallant
So unafraid
Sleeping back to back
You're turning away

How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
It was good, but now it's gone (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong

Sound of the times
Sound of your crimes
Thinking about the other night
Was it all in my mind?
I was so foolish, I was so blind
Why do we do this to each other, baby
Heartbreak by design

How could you tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(Could you tell me nothing's wrong?)
It was good, but now it's gone
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me nothing's wrong)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)

It's obvious
Be honest
It's obvious (Could you tell me nothing's wrong)
Be honest
It's obvious
Be honest
It's obvious (Just tell me baby)
Be honest
It's obvious
Be honest
Be honest, be honest

Tell me nothing's wrong
T-tell me nothing's wrong
T-tell me nothing's wrong
Yeah, yeah

How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along

// Little Of Your Love //

Give me just a little of your love

You're just another recovering heart
I wasn't even gonna try
You wouldn't even give up time
Could be so easy, you make it hard
Don't think about love too much
My love is gonna be enough

You're so close now
And I know now

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Don't it feel like that night was from a dream
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've never felt nothing like that
Looking at you, looking right back
You say nothing is ever as good as it seems
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Stop running your mouth like that
'Cause you know I'm gonna give it right back

You're so close now
(Don't let me down) (Don't let me down)
So don't let me down

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Oh with a little strength baby
Oh, I'll never let you down
With a little love, a little love, a little love, a little love
Give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love (ha)
Give me just a little of your love (come on)
Give me just a little of your love (baby)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)

Give me just a little of your love (ha, ha)
Give me just a little of your love (ha, come on)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love

// Ready For You //

Maybe I was trying to forget
All my crazy reactions over my ex
Maybe you played way too hard to get
So I kept it moving to another one night stand

I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
'Cause that's all I wanna do, oh
I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
So that's what I'm gonna do

I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

Maybe I couldn't tell you why
I didn't hide the first night I met you
We were locking eyes
They said you'd be like all the other guys
Two faced, but too numb to know it
Telling your pretty lies

But I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
'Cause that's all I wanna do, oh
I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
So that's what I'm gonna do

I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

Keep thinking about you
Thinking you almost slipped through
There won't be another day I let you get away
I keep calling 'til your guard comes down
'Cause I wanna keep you around
'Cause we started something good
But just know that before you
I wasn't ready for you
I wasn't ready for you
When you first met me (for you)
That's what I'm gonna do
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready for you, baby
I wasn't ready for you, baby
For you, baby, for you, baby
I wasn't ready for you

I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life (waiting my whole damn life)
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you (I wasn't ready for you)
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

I wasn't ready, baby
I wasn't ready for you
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
I wasn't ready, baby
I wasn't ready for you, babe
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready, no
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
I wasn't ready

// Something To Tell You //

On the way down, a fall from grace
I was in for a heavy one when I could feel you pull away
On the way down, it almost was too much to take
Even though I tried, it was never enough for running in the same damn place

But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

Heavy was the sound I could not lift
I could run for a million miles and never get away from it
But knowing that now, I couldn't be content
Even when it was looking up for us, it was difficult to pretend

But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, baby, I was innocent
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent
I let you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I got something to tell you, but I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you know that we're not seeing eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you that everything's alright
Oh, we could stay in this moment, I'd never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye

Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Oh, I'll never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

// You Never Knew //

It was a weight on my shoulders
A strain on my back
But I love to have you, right there by my side
(You couldn't take it)
(You couldn't take it)
It used to be, when we were alone
We shared such beautiful moments
(But lately it's been such a mix)
(You couldn't take it)
(You couldn't take it)

Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you

I came home to see you, you weren't around
Excuses were one right after the other
(You couldn't take it)
(You couldn't take it)
You woke up from another dream, another fight you didn't mean
Still, time after time
I came running to get you
(You couldn't take it)
(You couldn't take it)

Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you

(You couldn't take it)
Another heart, another day
So much time was thrown away
(You couldn't take it)
You know I love to be in love
(You couldn't take it)
So tired of trying to show you
I worked so hard

Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Don't keep me waiting, to the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you

I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you

// Kept Me Crying //

When you sleep, are you dreaming of me?
Hurts to say, but I'm always awake

If you want me, I'm waiting for you
If you call me, I'll pick up
No, I shouldn't, but I can't give up 'cause you

Kept me crying for so long, my tears have dried
When I hear your voice, those tears they come back to mind
So don't call me up just to tell me
You don't love me anymore
Still it wrecks me 'cause

I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget

When you leave, I can't stop my heart hurting
Hurts to say I keep thinking you'll stay

If you want me, I'll be waiting for you
If you call me, I'll pick up
No, I shouldn't, but I can't give up 'cause you

Kept me crying for so long, my tears have dried
When I hear your voice, those tears they come back to mind
So don't call me up just to tell me
You don't love me anymore
Still it wrecks me 'cause

I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I've got the cover, I can't pretend
That I'm anything more to you now
Than someone who's hard to forget
And after all these tears
After all my years of trying
I don't wanna hear
That none of it meant anything

I was your lover
I was your friend
...

// Found It In Silence //

I wanted an honest man
I thought I found one of them
Stood by him every time I was scared
I was blind, wasn't I
Thought he was an honest man
Who could put me back together again
Tried so hard to read his mind, through his eyes
I was scared, I was blind

But I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

Three fingers on the edge
You always talk me down in the end
Made me think you were right, all this time
Not this time, not this time
Both of us, holding back
But you were the most guilty of that
Someone else on your mouth, all this time
I was right, wasn't I

You told me, "don't walk away"
You told me not to walk away
You told me not to walk, walk, walk...

But I found it in silence, I finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, I finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (found it in silence), finally see (finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (found it in silence), finally see (finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

It was always for the better
And I guess I should have known
The truth is, it's your issue, I know I need to let it go
And though I have found happiness, in my life that's truly mine
You'd think I could just laugh it off, but it gets me every time

But I found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Finally see
Found it in silence, finally
Found it in silence, finally see
Found it in silence, finally

I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
...

// Walking Away //

You don't wanna talk, don't wanna work it out
If you were gonna face it, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a-
I waited hours and hours, hearing loud sirens
Suffered through lies differently
You see, now I'm not coming around
Coming around, coming around

I'm walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away

You don't wanna give and you don't wanna know how
If you were gonna change things, you wouldn't been there
What were you around, when were you are
Trying not think about it, baby
Running up and down the stairs
'Til there's nothing left between us but what we won't say

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away

I don't know what's said so many times before
But now it's keeping me away
I know you did it so many times before
But I never thought I'd be the one you betrayed
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us

Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you
Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you
Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you

Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
[x6]

// Right Now //

Gave you my love, you gave me nothing
Said what I gave wasn't enough
You had me feeling I was foolish
Forever thinking this could be the one

I wasn't even in the running
Already had your mind made up
You left me searching for a reason
Why'd you leave, left me in the dust

And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you love me, love me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need..
Saying that you need..
Saying that you need me
(Right now)

Gave you my love, thought I could trust you
You let me down at every turn
You had me hanging on a dream you never believed
You gave me your word

Finally on the other side now
And I could see for miles
And I've forgotten every line

And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you love me, love me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need..
Saying that you need..
Saying that you need me
(Right now)

Did you think this would be easy?
Thought this would be easy
Not now, not now
I know you heard me through an open window
Whispers carried to your ear
Whispers sounded so clear

(Somehow it's so clear now...
Somehow it's so clear now...
What's that sound?
That's your fading... away)

And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you love me, love me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need..
Saying that you need..
Saying that you need me
(Right now)

And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you love me, love me babe
(Right now, right now)
And now you're saying that you need..
Saying that you need..
Saying that you need me
(Right now)
(Right now, right now...)

// Night So Long //

I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The night's end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone
The night, slow, long

Then I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness, my only friend
In loneliness, my only fear
The night's end
Then I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening the door
Until your memory is gone
The night, slow, long

(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long
(I say goodbye to love again) slow, long

// Water's Running Dry //

We were thinking we were wise
There was a moment you and I
We saw a stranger cross our lives
That we could make it if we tried
And now this car won't drive this road
There are some things I should've known
There are some things on my mind
But I won't pick up the line

'Cause I don't have the heart to mend
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Nothing like the ones we'll make
Nothing left to do, but let it lie
But let's not wait till water's running dry

Now, I don't wanna compromise
'Cause, baby, both of us have tried
You know it hurts me letting go
It hurts me more than I could show
I close my eyes, see an open road
There are some things I wanna know
There are some things on my mind
But I don't know how to see it right

'Cause I don't have the heart to mend
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Nothing like the ones we'll make
Nothing left to do, but let it lie
But let's not wait till water's running dry

Don't wait up for me
I'm not coming home
I'm not tired
Gonna drive all night
Don't wait up for me
I'm not answering my phone
I'm headed north on the 5 till it's light
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me
Might not hear from me for a while

'Cause I don't have the heart to mend
We can never finish what we started
You couldn't be an honest man
So how could I be the woman you wanted?
It took us so long to find
Water's almost there in my eyes
Nothing left to do but cut the line
Let's not wait till water's running dry
