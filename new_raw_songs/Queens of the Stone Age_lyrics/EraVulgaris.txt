// Turnin' On The Screw //

Woo!

You've got the question? Please don't ask
It puts the lotion in the basket
You say bigger's better but bigger's bigger
White boy dressed up like a
Figure drawn inside a toilet on the wall
The world is round, my square don't fit at all

Oh

They say those who can't just instruct others
And act like victims of jilted lovers
You can't lose it if you never had it
Disappear man, do some magic
Want a reason? How's about because?
You ain't a has been if you never was

I sound like this

Scared to say, what is your passion?
So slag it all, bitter's in fashion
Fear of failure's all you've started
The jury's in verdict: retarded
I'm so tired, and I'm wired too
I'm a mess I guess, I'm turnin' on the screw

// Sick, Sick, Sick //

Young, dumb, don't see a problem
Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum
Simple as this â I'm in love with the risk
I know what I've done
But tell me what did I miss
So please don't save something
Waste not, save nothing
Lose the halo, don't need to resist
A lick of the lips and a grip on your hips

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

First thing we succumb to
Shall erase and undo days of unrelease
If there's no police
Race to slip into whatever fits you
Make something, make someone
Beg on a knee, baby, baby please
Pout your bottom lip, while cracking the whip
You know what we want is candy to cum to

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

Eternal eclipse in the teeth of the risk
The tongue is a twist in perpetual bliss
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever

Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)

Baby, baby come out
C-c-c-c-come out
Baby, baby come out
C-c-c-c-come out

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)

// I'm Designer //

My generation's for sale
Beats a steady job
How much have you got?
My generation don't trust no one
It's hard to blame
Not even ourselves
The thing that's real for us is fortune and fame
All the rest seems like work
It's just like diamonds
In shit

I'm high class I'm a whore
Actually both
Basically I'm a pro
We've all got our own style
Of baggage
Why hump it yourself
You've made me an offer that I can refuse
'Cause either way I get screwed
Counter proposal
I go home & jerk off

It's truly a lie, I counterfeit myself
It's truly a lie, I counterfeit myself
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own
You don't own, you don't own
What none can buy
You don't own, you don't own
Neither do I

High and mighty you say selling out is a shame
Is that the name of your book?
Push a silver spoon in your ass
No more holding us down, dog, down, mutt, nice mutt

You're insulted you can't be bought or sold
Translation offer too low
You don't know what you're worth
It isn't much
My piano's for sale
How many times must I sell myself
Before my pieces are gone
I'm one of a kind
I'm designer

Never again will I repeat myself
Enough is never enough
Never again will I repeat myself

It used to be the plan was screwing the man
Now its have sex with the man
After he buys you dot com for sale at a low, low price

It's truly a lie, I counterfeit myself
Its truly a lie, I counterfeit myself
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own me
You don't own, what none can buy
You don't own, you don't own, what love can buy
Neither do I

// Into The Hollow //

Au revoir, adieu, goodnight
I'm too wrong to get right
But I can't wait forever
I've always been alone
A fool believes he's clever
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone
Aren't you gonna follow?

I live behind my eyes
Be sure to keep the surprise
I break what I have borrowed
That's why I always go
Alone into tomorrow
Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone
Aren't you gonna follow?

Into the hollow
Into the hollow

// Misfit Love //

Wanna see my past in flames
Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't fussed
Where I was born, no escape
There there ain't even no good bad drugs
In the city, is it true?
If you don't, you act like you do
Feast of fools, I can't wait
Give 'em a taste of my misfit love
Complicate, incarcerate
Feel my heart break up

Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so goddamn sick, baby it's a sin (It's a sin)

Transforming is becoming
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
Transforming is becoming of me
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)
(I need a thrill, a thrill, I need a thrill, oh, I want a thrill)

Do me first, do your worst
Gimme what I want some of
One-track mind, no time to waste
Sidewalks, feel me strut so good
Gutter, don't forget this face
Let 'em taste my misfit love
I'll show you all my dirty tricks
Then show 'em again I'm so proud of 'em
It's cruel to be constantly
Feel my heart play dumb

Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin (It's a sin)

Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night
And if you're going anywhere tonight
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night
And if you are going, can I get a ride?
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night
It's impossible to wait until the light
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won

// Battery Acid //

Make you into dark
Straight into your heart
Sorry all you are
I don't really care
Well, I know you are
Robots, robots
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech
Spoken rabies
Spastic, plastic, battery acid
Yank on the leash
Dragging you backwards
Oh, my closed eyes
Never see it coming

There's nothing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
The sadistic twist you'll never learn
Battery acid, battery acid

Battery acid in my veins
Unidentified remains
"Yes" button broke to automatic
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are
You were
To feel the way you do
A lie, then call it true
Nothing except yourself and nobody else
Hanging over the edge

There's nothing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
The sadistic twist you'll never learn
In battery acid, battery acid, hey

// Make It Wit Chu //

You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
And I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin in the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That jus' ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon
I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wanna do
Anytime, anywhere, and I say babe

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
(Yeah)
I wanna make it
(Whooo)
I wanna make it wit chu

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again and again and again and again)

// 3's & 7's //

Lie, lie to my face
Tell me it ain't nothing
That's what I wanna hear
Take the lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me
Look what it did for him
Oh, oh

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss then I'm in heaven now

Run, you'll never escape
You'll see you go nowhere
So new you appear
Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings
Kiss you goodbye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss then I'm in heaven now

Keep going over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one's catching on, calling my bluff
The Devil made me holier than every man

What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
Making us all forget
Making us all forget

// Suture Up Your Future //

I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I've been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Done and buried all I carried
All my evil's through a needle
As it pull through the eye
What was and will are now gone

Don't sweat it
Thread it, to forget it
To feel like you've already gone on
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture and bury it all away
Bury it all away

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real
I won't waste it, turned to face it
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull
Tried explaining, done explaining
I got caught in the plaid
Of all this talking at once
I've been giving my love away
To the things that tear it apart
I'm gonna suture up my future

Thread it, to forget it
To feel like you've already gone on
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away
It's like this, just like this

// River In The Road //

A fast approaching monster, marching in a row
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold
Run, darling, run
I'll stall them if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine

Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Run, darling, run
I'll stall if I can
You'll escape and I'll be left rotting on the vine
Avert the children's eyes
Forgets left untold
Don't look back to see the blood
River in the road

Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, uh-uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Get sweet revenge with my blood
A river in the road

// Run, Pig, Run //

When I was young
We used to play the game of hide & seek
Someone go hide, I count to ten
You probably never played
Instead you talk a game of sheep
A skill you almost do perfect

Run, Pig, Run
Here, I, Come

I am no saint & make no claims
To being in the right
Its just for now, I am wrong-less
You probably wondering
With what to do, this has with you
I wanna play the game you missed

Run, Pig, Run
Here, I , Come

There is no safe place
There is no safe place
There is no safe place to hide

// Running Joke //

When I was a little boy
I looked under the stairs
The king and the pawns
Were caught unawares
Standing in the shadows
A whisperer to be
Just fishing in the darkness
Of possibilities

Just
Look
At you now
Yeaaaaah
Look at you now
Yeah
Ooooh
Look at you now

Among such style and grace
Our highest hopes
None standing still
The running joke
Where goes the warm embrace it fades
Without return
That lives to slip through fingertips and burn

Just
Look
At you now
Ooooooh
Look at you now
Ooooooh
Look at you now
Ooooooh
Look at you now

// Era Vulgaris //

I play a game 'til I'm dead
Or on a magazine
I wanna look like I'm dead
Dancing on a string
I eat the food when it's there
Make a mess of things
Get that look everywhere
But keep that look off my face

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

From a crumbling tower I see everything
London, Tokyo, New York City
There's no love
There's no love
There's no love
Any place

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition
Over, over left with who we are
Did you tell anyone?
Did you tell any place?

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

Just stare at the lights

// The Fun Machine Took A Shit And Died //

Got guns, do you wanna
Take aim at each other?
Scratch the itch? Give the finger?
'Cause we don't care
Anyway
Got knives, have you seen 'em?
In your back's where we keep 'em
And you're never gonna reach 'em
Now that sounds fair

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could

Boy, little town
Little king, little crown
Hope you give, hope you give
Why don't you just give in?
Come on, take it with a smile
At the bottom of the pile
You can beg, you can plead
It won't take a thing

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Oh, how could you win
Against yourself again?

[?]

How you like your position?
You ain't Robert Mitchum
You're ten pounds of shit
In a five pound bag

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Oh, how could you win
Against yourself again?
