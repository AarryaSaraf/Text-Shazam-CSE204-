Album: LullabiesToParalyze

// This Lullaby //

Where, oh, where have you been my love?
Where, oh, where can you be?
It's been so long, since the moon has gone
And, oh, what a wreck you've made me
Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?
Until the return of my love, this lullaby
My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and pray though each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream
And as sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby

// Medication //

Medication for us all, it's is a new way
And we're gonna take it cause we love it
Don't you know?
Is this the dose you've been dreaming of?
A revelation from a gun
Doesn't matter
Overtaken, mine was yours, now overthrown

No

Just copulation in a song
I'm so contagious, can I come?
In the new way
All of us cast asides became what has become

No

Medication for us all
You think you know me, well you're wrong
Doesn't matter
All of us cast aside became what has become

// Everybody Knows That You Are Insane //

You wanna know why you feel so hollow?
Because you are
You're missing out, well, if you say so
Then you're missing out

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

You wanna know
Just how long you can hide from
What you are, not very long
I have been lost, down every road I follow
Out in the dark and on my way home

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?
And I feel nothing, am I better yet?

Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane
Everybody knows that you're insane

// Tangled Up In Plaid //

I slipped
Didn't mean, didn't mean to do it that way
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow? (Shit)
I'm gone today

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooo-ooo, woah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Come, let's play along and let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me, don't matter to you

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooo-ooo, woah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Self-inflicted wound
Your gift, impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your wake

Oh yeah
(It hurts) So bad
(It must) Oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So kill yourself

// Burn The Witch //

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
Burn the witch

Holding hands
Skipping like a stone
On our way
To see what we have done
The first to speak
Is the first to lie
The children cross
Their hearts and hope to die

Bite your tongue
Swear to keep your mouth shut

Ask yourself
Will I burn in Hell?
Then write it down
And cast it in the well
There they are
The mob it cries for blood
To twist the tale
Into fire wood
Fan the flames
With a little lie
Then turn your cheek
Until the fire dies
The skin it peels
Like the truth, away
What it was
I will never say

Bite your tongue
Swear to keep your mouth shut
Make up something
Make up something good

Holding hands
Skipping like a stone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash and bone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash and bone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash and bone

// In My Head //

It's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high, I run in place
Only a line we separate, so

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

You're the only thing I've got
I can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace, so

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

Oh, oh
Hurry up, and wait forever

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head (It's all I've got)
And you're in my head, so I need it (In my head)

I keep on playing our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I need it
I need it
I need it
Now

// Little Sister //

Hey, sister, why you all alone?
I'm standing out your window
Hey, little sister, can I come inside, dear?
I want to show you all my love
I want to be the only one
I know you like nobody ever, baby

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow

You whisper secrets in my ear
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
They say I'll only do you wrong
Come together 'cause I understand
Just who you really are, yeah, baby

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow
A shadow

// I Never Came //

When you say "It's dead and gone"
Yes I know, you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die, yeah
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun
No rope, no stone
It won't die, yeah

Why you got to shove it in my face?
As if you put me in my place
Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Not goin' to spend another night
In your bed, in your bed

Laws of men are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love, so good, love, so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
Well, I just smile and move on
Words ain't free like you and me
I don't mind, yeah

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leaving cause it's just
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came

// Someone's In The Wolf //

Once you're lost
In twilights's blue
You don't find your way
The way finds you

Tempt the fates
Beware the smile
It hides all the teeth, my dear
What's behind them

So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever

He steps between the trees
A crooked man
There's blood on the blade
Don't take his hand

You warm by the firelight, in twilight's blue
Shadows creep and dance the walls
He's creeping too

So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever

So glad you could stay
So glad you could
So glad you could stay
So glad you could
So glad you could stay

// The Blood Is Love //

Saw you in a way
Beyond figurin' out
These lines of life have been drawn and can't be removed
Our eyes is all it took to know

Open up your eyes
Deep blue, glassy lake
And swim till water and sky
Now are one, out of two
Oh, my bloodshot eyes

Open up your mouth
Touch your lips to mine
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death and survive
Your words have branded my mind

Still I hold your hand
Wrapped as if a ring
We of flesh and blood are only carrying
It's so hard to
Well, you know
The seed waits for the reaper to sow

Every breath an art
The dignity to learn it can strain and break your heart
Take all your pieces home
You ask when you're alone, "what is love"
The blood is love

// Skin On Skin //

From the moment you said "why haven't you kissed me yet?"
I knew I'd wipe that paint from your lips
I stare the lids off your eyes
Gone down on your dirty mind
And end up between your hips
Handfuls of sweat tangled hair, anytime, anywhere
I wanna lick you too much baby
I just play all alone, whispering for your moan
Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch

I can get in, I can't get out
I can get in, I can't get out
I'm just sweating my sheets
I hate to see you leave
But I love to watch you go, baby
Twisted secret lives
The way you bat your eyes
Giving head, giving head, giving head

Watch you come from above
I'm so needy for love
I'm desperate
Greedy in slavery
I sneak around from behind
I got a one track mind
We got a skin on skin thing baby

I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin' oooh aaah baby
I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin' oooh aaah baby

// Broken Box //

And you know this
(It's all mine, alright)

I've got wine and so do you
Mine came with the cork
I wish yours did too

Everyone just loves you so
Well hurray! (Yay)
Now you know where to go (Easy)

In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
And tell your new boy where I came
In my head you're all brand new
I just didn't want what you gave
In my head you're all brand new
Go and find yourself another slave

There you are
There you are
There you are

Ooohh you're so in love, just like Juliet
Well guess what?
That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get

Tears from the sky
In pools of pain
Well baby tonight
I'm gonna go and dance in the rain
(Make up my own damn rules)

In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where I came
In my head you're all brand new
Take that broken pussy elsewhere
In my head you're all brand new
Save it, baby, I don't care

// You Got A Killer Scene There, Man... //

I don't mean to make obscene
But even the mob know what the hell I mean
The knot is tight, on my blindfold
I got my flesh full of blood
I hate rock and roll
Some think too much, then come too soon
I just curse the sun so I can howl at the moon

Yeah, ooo, ah
Yeah, ooo, ah
Yeah, ooo, yeah, ah
(Hah)

Don't wanna love you no more
Don't wanna love you less
I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress
What's the fucking difference? We all gonna die
You gonna do something killer?
Come on, give it a try

Yeah, ooo, ay
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, ah
Yeah, ooo, yeah, ah
(Hah, hah)

Got no big plans but a good idea
Let's put this town in my rear-view mirror
Yeah, I got enemies (Fuck 'em), but they don't know
They won't get no glory on that side of the hole

Yeah, ooo, ay
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, ah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hah, hah)

We are united, by drifting alone
This is the army of none, got no flag, got no home
Just witches & scabs, an awful mess
I confess (I confe...)
Let's do it again

Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hah)

There's only one line I would get

// Long Slow Goodbye //

Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where you gone?
Where you gone?

I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waiting, when you coming home?
Gone so long
Where you gone?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye

In every voice, I hear you speak
Waiting by the telephone
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Roll and tumble all night long
All night long
Where you gone? Yeah

On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Where have you gone again my sweet?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye
On a long slow goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

// Like A Drug //

Since you're gone, I sat at home
Wonder why no I'll never be free
But the thought of you
Going with another guy
No, it could never be me
You took a ring and pawned our love away
What can I say, I am left behind
So I take a drink, another cigarette
I can't forget that you once were mine

What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be, no
But now you're gone
It's us, your love is like a drug

It's been so long
Your folks have bet you're gone
But I know that you're alive inside
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away
I just wish that you still were mine

What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be
But now you're gone
It's just, your love is like a drug

// Precious And Grace //

Ridin' top the floodway on a Friday night
The landscape's a fine and nat'ral sight
Just cruisin' slow through the dark of night
With Precious and Grace ev'rything's all right

Good God Almighty, we was goin' down slow
Yeah, if we knew just where we had to go
Cryin', just a flyin' down a put out road
With Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford

So if you're out rollin' late some night
Yeah, and you need that supernatural delight, I'm talkin' to you, brother
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight
Get with Precious and Grace, they gonna treat you right
