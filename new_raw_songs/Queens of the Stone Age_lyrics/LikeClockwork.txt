// Keep Your Eyes Peeled //

Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, traipsing a minefield
Shotgun, never behind the wheel (Anymore)
Danger, monsters in smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Then wake me up

Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from Hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
Daydream until all the blue is gone

Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Wake me

Underwater is another life
Disregarding every myth we write
Rag doll churning, eagerly alive
(Over and over and gasping in horror
So breathless you surface
And just as the next wave hits)

Big smile, really a show of teeth
Without a care in a world, no fear
Lonely, you don't know how I feel
Praise God, nothing is as it seems

// I Sat By The Ocean //

I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard
Yet, I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything
So, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize
Maybe I don't need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, "Boy, if you want love
You'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are
Are you sure it's really you?"
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips
Because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one

You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer, we're crashing ships in the night

// The Vampyre Of Time And Memory //

I want God to come
And take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me?
Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore
Where's this going to?
Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here
It is as I've feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable
Is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all
Is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
Has died, I've survived
I speak, I breathe
I'm incomplete
I'm alive, hooray
You're wrong again 'cause I feel no love

Does anyone ever get this right?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love
I feel no love

// If I Had A Tail //

Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
I'm machine, obsolete
The land of the free lobotomy
I wanna suck, I wanna lick
I wanna cry and I wanna spit
Tears of pleasure, tears of pain
They trickle down your face the same
It's how you look, not how you feel
A city of glass with no heart

If I had a tail, I'd own the night
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
Animals in the midnight zone
When you own the world, you're always home
Get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves
Brainwashed or true believers
Buy flash cars, diamond rings
Expensive holes to bury things
I'm machine, I'm obsolete
In the land of the free immortality

If I had a tail, I'd own the flies
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-oh

Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

(Uh-uh-uh-uh) See me dancing on the scars?
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) See me dance?
Ah-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

If I had a tail, I will control the night
If I had a tail, I will control the night
(If I had a tail, I will control the night)
If I had a tail, I will control the night
(When we have a tail, we will control)

// My God Is The Sun //

Far beyond the desert road
Where everything ends up
So good, the empty space
Mental erase, forgive, forgot

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun

Well, I don't know what time it was
I don't wear a watch
So good to be an ant who crawls
Atop a spinning rock
(Beyond)

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Yeah
Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Healing, kneeling
Godless heathens

Godless heathens
Always want from the sky

// Kalopsia //

I never lie
To myself tonight
Rose-tinted eyes
Color my sorrow
A shade of wine

Bye-bye, black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye-bye (Bye-bye)

Oh, why you so sad?
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing God
Copycats in cheap suits
Are playing it safe
While cannibals of bad news
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Kalopsia
Kalopsia, kalopsia

Far, far from shore
The land of nightmares
Gone forever more
And I love you more
Than I can control

I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh, why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all
Fates favor the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row (As they row)
The boat (The boat)
To Hell, to Hell

Row

// Fairweather Friends //

[Josh Homme:]
Is there anyone out there?
Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone
Before the first rain could fall

It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well, it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone, well, so are
Well, so are you

[Josh Homme & Elton John:]
So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
Fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)

[Josh Homme:]
One day, when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink wine and screw is all we'll do
Every day (Yeah)

[Josh Homme, Elton John, Trent Reznor:]
So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
You know the hour's late (You're under blue sky)
Don't let 'em in your head (Fairweather friends) (You're under)
I'm gonna pray for rain again and again
Fairweather friends
Fairweather friends

[Josh Homme:]
Fairweâ
I don't give a shit about them anyhow

// Smooth Sailing //

Ah!
Oh, yeah

It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burnin' bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

I got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays whenever I yawn
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way
Every day

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
That needs getting done

Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it
(It's so easy to see) Yet so hard to find
Make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine

I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm risking it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done

Well, God only knows, so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior
(Every temple needs gold) Every hook needs to shine
Hell is at the temple of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed blinds

(Ah, shut up, shut up)
It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
Oh, shut up
Oh, ooh
Pow!

// I Appear Missing //

Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose; description
The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole, never to be found

It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire, both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine) I haven't a thing unless I have you
(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine) I've fallen through

// ...Like Clockwork //

Everyone, it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see, my dear
Is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here

The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light

Most of what you see, my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of what to show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here
