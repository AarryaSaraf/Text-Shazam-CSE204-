// Regular John //

Who are you, girl?
Who are you, boy?
Bet I know what you're up to
Can I come along
Your home number's on the wall
I just had to call, had to
I'm not the only one
Who will run with a knife

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

Eight six two, seven eight
Two six three, seven eight nine

Where's your daddy now?
I heard he ran away
Who are you, girl?
'Cause I'm so bored with myself
Anyway
Any time and any place
I'll just hang around

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

Eight six two, seven eight
Two six three, seven eight nine

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms
Open up your door
Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

// Avon //

I see you go
Through a park in a haze
And I don't listen
For traffic going the same way
A simple system, yeah
I string 'em up
I cut 'em down
Dare I say

To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to

A perfect vision
Some simple ways to let you know
Free range humans all cooped up
Naked clone is playing lame, yeah
I string 'em up
I cut 'em down
Dare I say

To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to

To to to
To to to

// If Only //

If it gets you down, well then I'll take it
If it gets you up, well I don't want it
It let you down so broken-hearted
If it gets you down, well then I want it

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all

So blow our mind and make it lazy
Those long long days with no escaping
I hold the wheel to let it go
Don't wanna stop, don't wanna know
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all

// Walkin' On The Sidewalks //

Got some action on the other side
Loose teeth in my head
New programs are coming in
So rise and take your oath
I wish we'd get away
Drink wine and screw
I knew someone else before
Looked a lot like you

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

I've been programmed as I said before
Technology
Just rolling, wheezing and breathing
Eyeballs and teeth
Words are weightless here on Earth
Because they're free
You knew someone else before
Looked a lot like me

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

// You Would Know //

Me just happy robot
Live on hill of beans
You and I cut from same cloth
Ripping at the seams
Cut, snip, cut

Don't forget to remember
The devil's got pills in his eyes
Look, laugh, but don't touch
Cut you down to size
Cut up, cut (shut up)
Cut up, cut

You would know

My girl's all out of focus
It ain't no big surprise
Daddy got his gun loaded
Got cross hairs in his eyes
Shut up, oh
Shut up, oh

You would know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know

You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know

// How To Handle A Rope //

Too late to think or filter any more
A bitter pill to swallow
Maybe you're in a blanket haze of ephedrine
I'm wondering where the hell you been
So come on and right this wrong, the rope

You got it all right
You got a feeling
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go
You got it all right
You got a feeling
Because devils and ropes around your neck
Cursing them all
And you can't hear it
Can't hear it

Ain't got a mind to deal with any more
Saboteur infiltrator and maybe more
If you're not blind and deaf
How can we pollute your head
So come on and right this wrong
The rope

And I got it all right
I got a feeling
You'd rather open up your wrist, let it go
I got it all right, yeah
I got a feeling
There's devils and ropes around my neck
I can't even know
'Cause I can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it

// Mexicola //

Setting sun deals hands of gold
There's velvet eyes in Mexico
Just a fall away
And all she said was true
Speak in tongues, speak in lies
Drooling livers, born to die
It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you

Oh, oh, oh

Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever

Point and shoot
I know just what you mean
In a world that's full of shit and gasoline babe
One dog's dead, one's on the phone
Just leave a lung or leave it alone
It's that same old song again
I hate it 'cause it's true

Oh, oh
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo

Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever
Keep saying go on
Keep saying go on
Keep saying
You won't live forever

// You Can't Quit Me Baby //

It's a mistake but who knows
Followed you home
Crawled in your window
This life is a trip when you're psycho in love
And I know

Followed your friends, you were not there
Slashed and I cut
I bled in the sink
Heard what you said and you're laughing maybe
Slashed and I cut
And I do it for you
I want you to notice when I'm not around
Wherever you are

You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell

// Give The Mule What He Wants //

You'll want it
You'll want it Sunday
He'll eat it
He'll eat it one day
How long, long, long
Do I wait, wait?
Be the mule that you gotta be, yeah

Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Underwater, underwater one day
Gonna sink it, make 'em think it's too late
For your love, love, love
For your love, love, love
Be the mule that you gotta be

Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh

// I Was A Teenage Hand Model //

Cozied up to the toilet
Face stuck to the floor
I met expectations
That I was tryin' to ignore
Job had such patience
I wonder, what's that like?
One hundred thousand million (Years)
That's what you like?
So I was thinking

Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

So these cities are sprouting
Like a spit in the eye
And this world isn't waiting
It's just passin' me by
I just peak in the window
Looking inside
The butcher's got a fork in your face and
I'm standing in line?
And I was singing

Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
Naaa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

// The Bronze //

I've been waiting
Waiting under things that rise in the morning
I've been holding, holding back so long
You can own it
Take it off my hands, do me a favor
Nothing wasted
Just fingerfucked and busted up all at once

I'm so lost out on the highway
With no direction left to go
Everyday sit up and wonder
Where it was I started from

The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around (Ah)

The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around (Ah)
Ah-yeah, yeah-ah-yeah
