// Mama Africa //

[Chorus:]
Mama Africa
How are you doing Mama
Mama Africa
Long time me no see you Mama

They took me away from you Mama
Long before I was born
They took me away from you Mama
Long before I came on in

[Chorus]

There's so many things about you
Wondering where you are
They try their best to hide you Mama
But I search and I find you

[Chorus]

In you there's so much beauty
In you there's so much life
In you there's so many kingdoms
To me it's out of sight

[Chorus]

You're the maker of gold Mama
You're the maker of diamond
You're the maker of pearls
And the maker of all precious goals

[Chorus]

I've been waiting, yearning, looking
Searching to find you
I've been crying, praying hoping
That I may find you Mama

[Chorus]

You're my mother Africa
You're my father Africa

[Chorus]

I'm proud of you Mama
I love you Mama
I'm proud of you Mama
I love you heavenly

[Chorus]

// Stop That Train //

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teaching the people who don't overstan'
And even though I've tried my bes'
I still don't find no happiness

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east
Some goin' west
Some step aside to try their best
Some livin' big
But the most livin' small
They just can't even find
No food at all

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train I'm leaving...

// Where You Gonna Run //

[Chorus:]
Where you gonna run
Where you gonna hide
Who you tryin to see
What you tryin to find

We're all in this race
Everybody trying to keep a pace
Can't get away
No no, there is no escape

The world is faced with problems
And many illusions
Love is the man overstanding
It's the only solution

[Chorus]

People walking around in disguise
Try to tell me what they're trying to hide
'Cause what you're looking for
It stay here with you all the time

The world is faced with problems
And many illusions
Love is the man overstanding
It's the only solution

[Chorus]

// Peace Treaty //

Do you remember the peace treaty
You sign in a kill some city
Do you remember the peace treaty
Them sign in a kill some city

And now this one have a gun
And this one have a gun when it pass law

All who signed that peace treaty

All who signed that peace treaty
Is now resting in peace in the cemetery

And this one have a gun
And that one have a gun when it pass everyone run
I say this one have a gun
And that one have a gun when it drop another weakheart drop

Because of the words I say

Because of the truth I say

When you sign that peace treaty
I told you it wouldn't worky worky
When you sign that peace treaty
I told them it could not worky worky

And now this one have a gun
And that one have a gun when it pass law, law, Babylon run
And this one have a gun
And that one have a gun
When it pop,somebody drop

And that was the peace treaty
Them sign in a kill some shitty
It was a peace treaty
Them sign in a Kingston city

And now this one have a gun
And that one have a gun when it pass law, law, Babylon run

And now this one have a gun
And that one have a gun when it pass law, law, Babylon run
But killers have no pity...

It was the peace treaty them sign in a the city...
Light the chalice
Sign the treaty
You still carry malice

// Feel No Way //

[Chorus x2:]
No bother feel no way
It's coming close to payday I say
No bother feel no way
Every man get paid accord his work this day

Cannot plant peas and reap rice
Cannot plant cocoa and reap yam
Cannot plant turnip and reap tomato
Cannot plant breadfruit and reap potato

[Chorus]

Cannot tell lie and hear truth
Cannot live bad and love good
Cannot live up and get down
Cannot give a dollar and want a pound

[Chorus]

Cannot be wrong and get right
Cannot be kicked and don't fight
Cannot drink water and get drunk
Cannot drink whiskey and stay sober
