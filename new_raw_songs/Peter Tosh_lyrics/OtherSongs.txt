// Go, Tell It On The Mountain //

Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Who's that yonder dressed in red,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder dressed in red,
Sets my people free?
I'm beggin'

Who's that yonder dressed in red?
Must be the children that Moses led.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Who's there yonder dressed, dressed in white,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder, full dressed in white,
Sets my people free?

I'm beggin'
Who's there yonder dressed in white?
Must be the children of the Israelites.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Ooh woo woo
Who's there yonder dressed in white,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder dressed in white,
Sets my people free?

I'm still beggin'
Who's there yonder dressed in white?
Must be the children of the Israelites.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

I'm beggin
Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.

I've got two boys and a woman
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
And I know they won't suffer now
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
Jah, forgive me for not going back,
But I'll be there anyhow
Yes, I'll be there anyhow.

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I got to get on down
Lord, I got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be found

Tell Ziggy, I'm fine
And to keep the dollar in line,
'Cause we're soon to move now, we are
Tell Anthy, I'm fine
And to keep daughter in line
We gonna have one six-day show, a war.

Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

They coming on another bridge
(shoob-shoob-shoo-be-doob)
Another Ziggy-Ziggy-Ziggy bridge
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
I'll send you a check through the post,
Though you did not get the first
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll send another to quench your thirst
The war will soon be over
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And Africa will unite
The children who livest in darkness
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Have seen the great light!

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on movin'
Where I can't be found
