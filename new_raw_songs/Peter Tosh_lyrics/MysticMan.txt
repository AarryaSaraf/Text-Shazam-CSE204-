// Recruiting Soldiers //

[Chorus:]
I'm recruiting soldiers
For Jah army
Recruiting soldiers
Jah time is now

Satan forces
They all rise up to fight
They all rise up to fight Jah and the saints

See them fighting
Against Jah children

See them slaughter them light slaves
Hear them come say Jah is dead
But they didn't show me his grave
No, no

[Chorus]

Anti-Christ forces
They all rise up
To fight against Jah and his saints
I can tell you

But there is confusion
In high places
About the lamb that was slain
And all these years I hear them say
Their building a nation
But all these tricks were just a game

[Chorus]

Lightning forces
Jah time is now
Lucifer forces
They all they all rise up
To fight against Jah and his saints
But that won't work

Hear them praising old Marcus Garvey
Hear them exalting his name
But all these times they be doing that I say
If he was here right now he'd go to jail the same

[Chorus]

Only to fight... fighting a losing battle
But they fight

// Jah Seh No //

Must Rasta bear this cross alone
and all the heathens go free?
Jah say no. Jah say no.

Must Rasta live in misery
and heathens in luxury?
Jah say no. Jah say no.

He's coming to tear down the walls of downpression,
drive away transgression,
clean up corruption,
rule equality.

Must righteous live in pain
and always put to shame?

Must they be found guilty
and always get the blame?

No form of destruction
won't crumble my bones.
Jah say no. My Father say no.

Him a go tear down the walls of a Babylon,
eliminate Satan,
clean up corruption,
rule equality.

So I will not bear this cross alone
and all the world go free.

// Fight On //

Africa has got to be free

[Chorus:]
Fight on brothers, fight on
Fight on and free your land
Fight on sisters
Fight on and free your fellow man

Africa has got to be free
By 1983
Come on make us see
Brothers fight on

You have paid your dues
And you have nothing to lose
And that is always my views
You've got to fight on

[Chorus]

'Cause if Africa is not free
Then we all will be
Back in shackles you see
My brothers fight on

[Chorus]

Brothers of scorn in exile
For such, such a long while
Vasis him too vile

[Chorus]

We need majority rule
Scimit and vasta is too cruel
Early morning dew
Fight on

[Chorus]

Fight on and free yourself
Fight on and free the land
Fight on and free your fellow man

// The Day The Dollar Die //

I see Johnny with his head hanging down
Wondering how many schillings left in that pound
Cost of living it is rising so high
Dollar see that have heart attack and die

Bills and budgets are waiting
Finance ministers anticipating
Unemployment is rising
And I hear my people, they're crying

The day the dollar die
Things are gonna be better
The day the dollar die
No more corruption
The day the dollar die
People will respect eachother
The day the dollar die

Tell me brother
Is there something I can do
Don't you let frustrations make you blue

Time is hard
And I know that is true
But if you pick yourself up
That's all you've got to do

Things can be much better
If we can come together
Long time we been divided
And it's time we be inited

The day the dollar die
Gonna be better
The day the dollar die
I won't need no pockets
The day the dollar die
Don't have to be frettin'
The day the dollar die

Now I see you standing on your feet
And you can also make two ends meet
Never you let life problems get you down
There is always a solution to be found

Bills and budgets are mourning
Finance ministers groaning
Unemployment is rising
And I hear my people crying from the ghetto

The day the dollar die
It's gonna be nice
The day the dollar die
Just you wait and see
The day this here dollar die
There be no more inflation
The day the dollar die

I say the day Danny dollar die
The day Sammy dollar die
We will love eachother
I said the day this a dollar die
Fight some inflation

All I see is man's abomination
Causing combination
Amongst the younger generation

Rumors of war
Talkin' 'bout the coming of Jah Jah
