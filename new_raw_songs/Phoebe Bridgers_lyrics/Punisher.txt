Album: Punisher

// Garden Song //

Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

// Kyoto //

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train, went to the arcade
I wanted to go but I didn't
You called me from a payphone, they still got pay phones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend so I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying

I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

// Punisher //

When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If you're favorite thing's dianetics or stucco

The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

What if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?

And here everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times alone and some looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Ooh, I'm not

What if I told you I feel like I know you
But we never met?
It's for the best

I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could, wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

// Halloween //

I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Always surprised what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
(Whatever you want)

// Chinese Satellite //

I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I die

Sometimes when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

// Moon Song //

You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door

We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad his baby died
We fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
Then I went to bed upset

Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
Can't for the life of me remember what it is

And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

You are sick, and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand

// Savior Complex //

Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car
Windows up
Crocodile tears
Run the tap 'til it's clear

Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the heat
You're gonna drown in your sleep
For sure, wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel
One in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down

Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine

All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours

// I See You //

Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

// Graceland Too //

No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to do
She could go home, but she's not going to

So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants
Or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew that

I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

// I Know The End //

Somewhere in Germany but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back I'll lay around
And I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize the quiet life
There's no place like my room

But you gotta go
I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go
I know, I know, I know

Out in the park we watch the sunset
Talking on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet and I got mean
Always pushing you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call you come home
A bird in your teeth

So I gotta go
I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it
I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now
I know, I know, I know

Driving out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America first rap country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolts of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said the end is near
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here
Yeah, I guess the end is here
I guess the end is here
Yeah, I guess the end is here
