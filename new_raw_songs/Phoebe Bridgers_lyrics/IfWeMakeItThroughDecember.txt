Album: IfWeMakeItThroughDecember

// If We Make It Through December //

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas gear

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

// 7 O'Clock News / Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

// Christmas Song //

Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it

// Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas //

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
