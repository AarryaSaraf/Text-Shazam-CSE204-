Album: HellOn

// Hell-On //

God is not a contract or a guy
God is an unspecified tide
You cannot time its tables
It sets no glass or gables
God is a lusty tire fire
Its bristles scrape and strike the stage
A rock, paper, scissors' rage
Have mercy on the natural world

My voice is not the liquid waves
The perfect rings around a heron's legs
My voice is straight garroting wire
A stolen mile of fingerprints
Peeled the quiet from the dunes
Captured and re-spooled as ruin to be used
At a different time

My voice is a fracture
For shinbone's lust
Pounding barefoot ground
It lifts you up and sits you just
Just at sorrow's waterline
I drape you on tomorrow's plate
Fair as metal, marrow spilling
Not yours but mine
I'm an agent of the natural world

Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with
Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with

Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise

And me, I am not a mess
I am a wilderness, yes
The undiscovered continent for you to undress
But you'll not be my master
You're barely my guest
You don't have permission to take any pictures
Be careful of the natural world

Nature can't amend its ways
Boils along and then replays
Despite heartfelt springtimes of regret
The storms she still cries for days
Have mercy on the natural world

// Last Lion Of Albion //

Early in the morning where there used to be a stream
Is a tiny business lake
Don't let the cattails fool you
Down in the bottom where nothing is born
Sleeps a silver dollar with your face thereon

Wish I could trace the frowning compass of your mind
Drop the mercury down the Roman drain and summon mine

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Laid in the heavens that are already bought
Sleeps a red planet in a galaxy of your lion's thoughts
On the surface of your tender unintended machine
Is there a buckle knuckle kneel on a carpet of lion's tongues

Wish I could stand in the spray of the cliff of your sweet revenge
Ocean of naked serrated marble crushing in

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
Your wounds the main road into London
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Last lion of Albion
The last she-wolf to mother Rome
The last virgin to wash ashore
You'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
The last of the Mohicans gone
The last cedars of Lebanon
You'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
Last tiger of Tasmania
The last she-wolf to suckle Rome
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face
Face on their money

// Halls Of Sarah //

A childless widow of a nation
You cry like guns across the water
Yet we expect you to bring springtime, it isn't fair
Searchlights wither in your hair

You are a silent movie, Sarah

Men build their industries around you
Gathered in withers of your hair
They're looking farther on reflection
You're left to die of exposure, Sarah
Sarah with the beating heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
Sarah with the..
You are a silent movie, Sarah

Let her go, the light is fading
I cry like guns across the water
She didn't ask to be your remake or your muse
The parasites inside of booze

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is no one home

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is only echo

From a recording machine
Screaming [?] my dreams
You see our poets (poets)
Do an odious business
Loving womankind (womankind)
As lions love Christians
So who are you to deny
Who are you to deny them, Sarah?
(Sarah...)

(Echo, echo...)

(Round and round and round and round and round...)

// Bad Luck //

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Do you wish you could stop everything
And take back your love?
Are you sorry you gave it up so easy?
Do you cry like you're trying to be born?

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

And love, the most contrary, I said, of them all
Dragging in on nature's coattails
Acting like it wrote the moon
Trying to pass riddles as poetry
Embargo is love's waiting room
And meantime, right here in human time
My heart could break for a one-legged seagull
And still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work

// Curse Of The I-5 Corridor //

I waited too long to write this down
The startling sensation is fading
The sweet sweet burn of the
First drink of the night underaged
Knowing that you're gonna get away with it

You were a good man before you knew it
And I'm not vain enough to think that
I'd have been good for you if I'd stayed
In the current of your life
I was an eyelash in the shipping lanes

And now I'm so scared about mystery
I fear I smell extinction in the
Folds of this novacaine age coming on
I miss the smell of mystery
Reverb leaking outta tavern doors
And not knowing how the sounds were made

So I left home and faked my ID
I fucked every man that I wanted to be
I was so stupid then
Why should mystery give its last name

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight

Now I'll see you in our old home
Where I'm always scared to go
Those thirty garbage miles
Making with cigarette butts and used tires
To be poor is the anchor that makes us so sure

Your sandy voice across my brow you haven't aged a day
Is it because you took a shortcut that
Makes people say you're crazy
Is it true
You're a time traveler you
Is it true
I've seen crazy too

Can it be a comfort between us
Because I never want to know for sure

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight

The instrumental over the bridge

Now I write this in a pale town
Where excitement is a yellow curd
My dream awake leaps through my window
From the highway

You turn my handles at the brake too late
It needs to tease metric tons
The crash comes
It goes down my public face
Behind the reservoir of collar bones
Forms two private lakes

Baby I'm a fool

Hopping is so easy
You haven't gained a day
To self fulfilling prophecies
Who don't even have each other
Not that we would ever get away with it

// Gumball Blue //

So sorry for the trouble
The times we've been afraid of each other
'Cause we didn't understand
All the spells we cast without trying
We pushed through

Shipwreck in my lap
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

Their damp bodies crammed in Times Square
I logged a furious path one hinted
To a hotel with no one waiting
But me and me and my whole life a fever and the phone
How was I to know
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

When strangers say, "I love you"
You're banished to a planet with no sounds
No sounds (no sounds)

But you come back for me
Sometimes only for your own peace of mind
Sometimes where there's smoke
There's just a smoke machine, honey
Honey

I've lived singing your songs
Long-legged mazes and English geometry
Daring not consider we were here
Should we break spells without trying
We cut our lasers short at cryin'
And kindly banish the soundless planet
Stain the edges of the nebula gumball blue

Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year

// Dirty Diamond //

Found these in a box at the bus stop
My name's at the bottom
But I'm nowhere to be found
I really get around they say

So I take these sightless creatures home
Then I fear them so to tremble
For I'm no mother, I
Just some random defender

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

We raced along the ground
I chased it out of town
The sun's the meanest easy target
That I know

We played a tender game
Of kissing cobra tag
We slipped astride our horses
Dry dust in their manes

My friend would touch my face
And leave a star or two
The years left constellations
Of our wild language

What drove the sun away
I'm far too small to know
A gaslight [?] that's free to march
Is only [?]

What can I tell you now
It's better way along the canal
Draw mosquito clouds
From the dens of hot tires for miles
Draw mosquito clouds
From the dens of hot tires for miles

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
Starving, lover, lier
But you're uninspired too
According to your anthem you

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
And I am just desire
One dirty diamond
Some random defender

I sold my flesh that I might die
So the world will spin
And my cubs won't cry
I have to be the sun for them
Oh, petroleum
Ah, beautiful
But so am I

I'm the dirty diamond
Lying, looking at the sky
I'm the dirty diamond
Lying, looking at the sky

// Oracle Of The Maritimes //

I planned a dream inside a dream with your uncle
A fisherman who died
The oracle of the maritimes
Too cloudy to see fireworks
We would ride a chest of drawers into the waves
His granite hand held mine

I asked him how to tell you how much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so sure of anything

Sometimes I feel so beautiful, it's strange for a tomboy
Bruises up her legs, big hand holds my face
Sometimes I feel so ugly, I'm afraid
Worry nesting in my hair
Shedding like a Christmas tree
Surely there's a real woman coming to erase me

There's no way I could tell you how much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so scared of anything

And I'm not even wearing underwear
No exotic, I just forgot to
And I'm too much for people, so I gauge
And shout my thoughts here from a distance

That's no way to tell you how much I could love you
Though I've never been so sure of anything

Let go of my hand, and pass me an oar
The oracle of the maritimes
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"

// Winnie //

I'm here to tell you a story
I'm here to tell you a lie
My poetry's weak and I know it
I was dropped at sad and crazy sometimes
So I fucked off, wayward canon to the sea
On land I was just an appetite
Of it started as a joke, now it ruled me
Sick on chronic mathematics
I just wanted to feel music

Her fever delivered me from the flue
The night hag's hands spread lovingly
Pulling the cape from the sunrise
And revealing a bank of warships called "she"s
Warlike then reckless, I realized
No weapons were drawn that I could see
Save the blazing stare of the captain
Who held lightning captive from her teeth

So I looked off the edge of the world
I saw the girl who changed everything
That's when I met Winnie
I wanted to be her sailor's tattoo
She sang me a song that was too sad for some
Struck up the band and filled up her lungs
Her mouth was sharp as the rib of a star
She told molting truths that would break our own hearts

We were warriors!
We clothed ourselves in the guts of our enemies
Whoâd no respect for the wild
Warriors!
Long before hotwire safari park husbandry

And the joy ran through us like the weather's flux
We just wanted to be music
The joy ran through us like the weather's flux
We just wanted to be music

Her gravity pulled up my sad remains
Finger the curve of her cunning bow
I've loved you so long, Winnie
I want to be your sailor's tattoo
I've loved you so long, Winnie
Luring softly into you

// Sleep All Summer //

Weary sun, sleep tonight, go crashing into the ocean
Cut the line that ties the tide and moon, ancient and blue
We take our empty hearts and fill them up with broken things
To hang on humming wire like cheap lamps down a dead end street

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

Combing over Broken Cross I held on you
Haunted by the ghost of something new

Curtains fall fashions fade an endless summer over
Another tide to launch an autumn moon over the dunes
There must be a better way to pull a whole apart
To keep the walls from caving in
Another way to while away from you, frozen and blue

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

Why won't you fall back in love with me?
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

// My Uncle's Navy //

These memories are bitter in mood
I'd cut them out myself if that were possible
Kind you cry yourself blind about
Kind that choke you out, choke you out

Had an uncle who was not by blood
Liked to scare all the little girls away
And if you're tenderhearted you should stop the tape
Snap the tape

He pulled the heads off of garter snakes
I cried so helpless for those dyin' creatures
You know I cried so hard I pissed myself
Twistin' away from the horror

In the dark at sea
Memories wear thick coats
The kind that pull you down
By refusin' to drown
You're choked under the shape
Of a sailor
A sailor

Deputized by the cruel god of children
No running water in his soul, just a hole
Echoed when he called your name from down the hall
His name was a command that cuts the ears off fightin' dogs
Then wipes the knife on his militia pants

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains

And he's braggin' all the while
If I say that black is blue it's blue, black is blue if I say it is
Black is blue, black is blue if I say it is

I never wondered what made him that way
Bullies are not born, they're pressed into a form
And I hated those who gave him access to our days, the ones who did nothin'
I still can't love them

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains

In the dark at sea
Memories wear thick coats
The kind that pull you down
By refusin' to drown
You're choked under the shape
Of a sailor
A sailor
A sailor

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains

// Pitch Or Honey //

I hear overtones that make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control

I use major chords to make this the saddest song
An effective manipulation
Moonlight reflected is many times stronger

I wrote this song for me
And now I let it go
From the island of the Texaco
I release it into the custody of my huckleberry friend
(Am I making pitch or honey?)

No idea why I feel strong
Am I making pitch or honey?

It's the gift that keeps on getting
It's the shrapnel from your wedding, she said
It's the gift that keeps on getting
It's the shrapnel from your wedding, she said

Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so

I heed overtones to make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control

When I am dark and I am down as dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile is to remember

Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so (I heed overtones)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so (Out of reach of human hands, we don't have control)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so (I heed overtones)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so (Out of reach of human hands, we don't have control)

When I am dark and I am down as dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile is to remember
That my love is wild
And may you ever return
To the warmth of your species
