// Be And Bring Me Home //

If the way is clear my friend quick
If the way is clear my friend don't kick
Suddenly my fireplace is friendly
Bringing me home

Suddenly I may control
Take little things meaning big so's I'm not alone
Suddenly I'm not sick
Won't you be and bring me home

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home

Her jewelry drops all its grime
Fed up crazy fanatics lose their crazy rhyme
We are ahead of time
All I can hear now is your chime
You find out that you is what is spoken for
You find out that you have no broken door
Nothing is known of where to go back for more
Like the waves are sparkling
Just like the diamond shores

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home

You have your side, it's yours
Except for us if it's your pleasure
You can tap on my mind
You can play the cat jive
Someone was missing love
And now this someone is going home
I knew that you were missing
But I couldn't tell how
And I'm missing you
And me receives that we are not alone

Be and bring me home
We can't roam, no
Be and bring me home

They told me you were dirty
But I don't see no dirt
They told me you were strong
Funny I don't feel hurt
They said you were a criminal
No one sees no crime
They said I might need their dirty prisons
But I love the way you don't give me time

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam, no
Be and bring me home

I don't care what they tell me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think
I'll love my family always
Special and magical music
These are feelings from one to another
No foot moves through you trying for to kick
I won't jump on you though we are all rubber

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home

// Nothing To Remember //

I spent my life becoming invisible
Itâs hard to maintain and itâs hard to get by
I donât recall, fight or flight setting in
I had no introduction
I just breathe it in like the air

And thereâs nothing to remember
There is nothing to remember

I owe you nothing
Thatâs all Iâve got for you
And youâll borrow nothing
Thatâs what you expect of me
So you send me a love
Out of thin sailorâs knots
And I fear underneath the weight of your thoughts
My footsteps now they wonât echo too loudly

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And Iâll give you those

You told me something that scared me to death
Donât take me home
I canât face that yet
Iâm ashamed that Iâm barely human
And Iâm ashamed that I donât have a heart you can break
Iâm just action
And other times reaction

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And Iâll give you those
Just donât make me go home

Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember

// Oh, Shadowless //

Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking to long
Gonna make your bed
Gonna smooth your brow
Call me from nowhere
When you're safe in a dream

You don't have to ask
Just focus past me
Out the back door
Shining new with dew
Upon the grass
Just focus past me
Idles a comet
Waiting for you

Oh, heart of sand
Mouth of glue
Don't know where you're going
But you're safe in a dream
Oh, shadowless
I'm just too small
To know where you are going
But I feel you still

Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking too long

Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking too long

// That's Who I Am //

I'm a whole lot of big little girl
And I know what men like
But got bored 'cause here comes Ana
With a skirt harked up high
When you hold me tight and look into my eyes
I could sucker you into believing all of my lies

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now

I can be as nice as pie whenever I need to
But my hand in your front pockets
And tighten up your screw
Make you feel like a big man walking with your Barbie doll
Pull you down when you ain't around
And kick you when you fall

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now

I can laugh at all your jokes, particularly when it's you
Had better and I had worse, but I guess that you'll do
Don't try to boss me, you think I really care?
'Cause there's hundreds of boys waiting
Waiting for me out there

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now
