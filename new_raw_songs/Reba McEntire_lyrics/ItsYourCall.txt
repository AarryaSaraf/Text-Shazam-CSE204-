Album: ItsYourCall

// It's Your Call //

It's your call, It's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hangin' on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it don't act so surprised

It's time to end this game you're playin'
She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line

It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night

Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, It's your call

There's no easy way out this time
Cause I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

Oh, I've got to know if I still matter
It's somethin' only you can answer
Here's the phone, It's your call

// Straight From You //

People love to talk
And Lord I've heard it all
A rumor's not a stranger in this town
Now me, I pay no mind
But it's hittin' home this time
Now I've been told you've gone and let me down

I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you

They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hude
I think that you owe me
Just a little honesty
And even though you told me with your eyes

I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you

// Take It Back //

You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now how many times you sold that pack of lies

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting 'round in some ole pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are with me cause babe, I got no use for you

Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back

// Baby's Gone Blues //

I feel the blues coming on
Cause I feel you being gone
It's something I wish I could lose
Baby's gone blues

There ain't no sunshine in sight
Cause you're gonna leave me tonight
My heart is sure feeling bruised
Baby's gone blues

Oh - love has gone wrong
It's so hard on my heart going from good into gone
There ain't no easy way back into nights before you
Baby's gone blues
Baby's gone blues

It's like a razor on me
Knowing you want to be free
I'm standing here feeling used
Baby's gone blues

There ain't no dreams coming true
I won't recover from you
There ain't no heartache like you
Baby's gone blues

Oh - love has gone wrong
It's so hard on my heart going from good into gone
There ain't no easy way back into nights before you
Baby's gone blues
Baby's gone blues

// The Heart Won't Lie //

Looking back over the years
Of All the things I've always meant to say
But words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

'Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

'Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

// One Last Good Hand //

The stars are way out of reach, they all said
Those are crazy schemes that fill your fool head
But it was clear from the moment we met
We could prove them wrong

All my life I heard that same old story
Dare to dream and you'll just be sorry
I might have given up my shot at glory
But then you came along

We're not expecting this to go down easy
We're not expecting any sweet dreams
Sure thing
But with a little luck
Could be we'll be
Winding up the way we planned
Heading for our promised land
Holding one last good hand

Something's calling us I know you hear it
Day by day I feel us growing near it
But once you find a kindred spirit
There's nothing you can do

Oh, baby I'm not saying we won't ever stumble
Some days will be rough and tumble
You and I know that life's a gamble
But I'll
Bet mine on you

We're not expecting this to go down easy
We're not expecting any sweet dreams
Sure thing
But with a little luck
Could be we'll be
Winding up the way we planned
Heading for our promised land
Holding one last good hand

// He Wants To Get Married //

He believes in the family unit
The union of man and wife
He believes that you stand before God
For better, for worse and beyond this life

He believes that a ring on his finger
Is something to be proud of
For all of the world to witness
That he is committed to this love

He wants to get married

He'll build a house in the country
Where he'll watch his children grow
And teach them the values of something
That most people never even know

He wants to get married

I never thought I would be so blessed
To know a man like this
He's everything, everything I believe that a man should be

And when he is called to his maker
He wants to go to his grave
With his final remembrance of this earth
To be one last look at his wife's face

He wants to get married
He wants to get married
Oh, he wants to get married

But not to me

// For Herself //

Uncle Slim had let her know she couldn't ride that horse
He was the one that was only meant for men
She walked around till way after dark
Rode that horse with all her heart
And in the night how she rode

Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself

Mama and daddy told her from the start he was no good
They'd seen how he treated the other girls
She waited around till the sun went down
Slipped out of the house not makin' a sound
And in the night oh how they drove

Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself

It was fifteen years to the day he became a stranger in her eyes
In the coldest words of anger
He said without me you won't survive

There's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago
She don't leave a note that's not her style
So she waited around till way after dark
Left that man who broke her heart
Now she's gone, oh she's gone

Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself

// Will He Ever Go Away //

On a cool gray morning, I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start fallin' after all this time

How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away

Shouldn't I start living my life for myself
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else
Oh why should it be his touch I feel in the dark
And will his voice always echo through my heart

How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away

// Lighter Shade Of Blue //

I guess it finally dawned on me you're gone
Well maybe I can make it on my own
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call
And some nights I don't dream of you at all

Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

Lookin' down the line sometimes
I think I see a change
But then I think again and think of you
Here and there I've turned a stone
But the mountain hasn't moved
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

I'm still afraid of turning out the light
And it takes all my strength to face the night
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

Lookin' down the line sometimes
I think I see a change
But then I think again and think of you
Here and there I've turned a stone
But the mountain hasn't moved
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue
