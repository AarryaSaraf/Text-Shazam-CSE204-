// I've Never Stopped Dreaming Of You //

I've forgotten your number
I hadn't called in a while
And I'm slowly forgetting your funny little smile
I've even stopped missing
The love that we knew
But I've never stopped dreaming of you

I've lost all the memories
The feel of your touch
And it's left my mind why I loved you so much
I've even forgotten who walked out on who
But I've never stopped dreaming of you

I've never stopped seeing your face every night
I see it each time that I close my eyes
And time's heal the memories
Of the pain I went through
But I've never stopped dreaming of you

I've misplaced all the trinkets
That you told me to keep
And it's been such a long time
Since I've lost any sleep
Now I'm doing just fine
With somebody new
But I've never stopped dreaming of you

I've never stopped seeing your face every night
I see it each time that I close my eyes
And time's heal the memories
Of the pain I went through
But I've never stopped dreaming of you

No I've never stopped dreaming of you

// Hold On //

Hold on cause this feels just like a first love
There's no way to rehearse love
We'll just learn as we go

I know you can see it in my eyes
I've been looking in your eyes
The feeling is starting to grow

Hold on
Love can take us up so high
But it can take us down so low
You either laugh or you cry
Hold on
Cause love's a chance that we're taking
And I don't think we're mistaking
We'll never know till we try

Hold on
Cause here comes all the conversations
The painful midnight confessions
That leave you feeling so sad

I know we can make it forever
If we just face it together
Take the good with the good

Hold on
Love can take us up so high
But it can take us down so low
You either laugh or you cry
Hold on
Cause love's a chance that we're taking
And I don't think we're mistaking
We'll never know till we try

Hold on
Love can take us up so high
But it can take us down so low
You either laugh or you cry
Hold on
Cause love's a chance that we're taking
And I don't think we're mistaking
We'll never know till we try

// I Know I'll Have A Better Day Tomorrow //

Well I can't make it through this world by myself
I need heaven's help to make through the day
And if I go to bed tonight
And remember to say my prayers
I know I'll have a better day tomorrow

Cause you've done what you said you'd do
And you've given me lots of love
And I've never known such peace
Since I met you
I'm so proud to be your child
And I'm doing the best I can
And I know I'll have a better day tomorrow

Well you've done what you said you'd do
And you've given me lots of love
And I've never known such peace
Since I met you
I'm so proud to be your child
And I'm doing the best I can
And I know I'll have a better day tomorrow

I know I'll have a better day tomorrow

// Don't Say Goodnight, Say Good Morning //

Thought we could make it on our own
Looks like we didn't get too far
Love has found its way back home
Guess time just couldn't change
The way we are

That old feeling comes so easy
When your body's close to mine
I think our crazy hearts have finally made their
Always one more time

Don't say good night, say good morning
We can make it this time if we try
Don't say good night, say good morning
And in the morning
Never say goodbye

The night's ours and we're alone
I know I've wasted too much time
Chasing rainbos that I could never run out
I've come back to make you mine

Don't let the morning come too early
Don't leave me here to face the day
Take me in your arms and never let me go
And don't let the feelings slip away

Don't say good night, say good morning
We can make it this time if we try
Don't say good night, say good morning
And in the morning
Never say goodbye

Don't say good night, say good morning
We can make it this time if we try
Don't say good night, say good morning
And in the morning
Never say goodbye

// Muddy Mississippi //

I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me
The morning sun would find me
Swinging from the rope that's hanging free
And I drop in to the waters
And go swimming in the muddy Mississippi

A boy came to the Delta
And we would swing together from that tree
I could see my dreams in his eyes
As he held on to me
Swinging in the sunlight
Loving in the shadows
Wild and free
And I made him promise he would take me
Down to New Orleans

Bright lights of the city made my red dress and shoes look brand new
While he worked the night shift
I turned on and I turned loose
I lost my pride I lost my man
I did things a girl like me shouldn't do

Now I can't face this living
With the swelling signs of new life
Showing through

I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me
The morning sun would find me
Hanging from the rope that's swinging free
And I'll swing for the last time over the waters
Of the muddy Mississippi

Yeah the muddy Mississippi

// It's Another Silent Night //

Silence is golden
When the one that you're holding
Means more then love words can say
But what I don't hear
From you makes me fear
That our love is slipping away

The quiet's so loud
It fills up the house
With words that can't be set free
So who'll break the curse
And say the first word
Well I don't know
We're not talking you see

It's another silent night
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight
It's another silent night

If we could just talk
And tear down the wall
That stands there between our hearts
We could put back together
Our love for each other
Before it all falls apart

It's another silent night
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight
It's another silent night

It's another silent night
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight
It's another silent night

// Empty Arms //

Empty arms
That long for you
And they wait
Dear just for you
And these arms
Will stay this way
Till you return
To them someday

Each lonely night
I go to bed
I hug the pillow
Where you used to lay your head

Empty arms
But not for long
Cause my baby's coming home
And when he
Walks through the door
These empty arms
I'll have no more

And when he
Walks through that door
These empty arms
I'll have no more

These empty arms
I'll have no more

// Love Is Never Easy //

Love should be easy
It's such a natural thing
Nothing feels like the feeling
Only love can bring

Love can be laughter
Or heartaches in disguise
You could love a lifetime
And never realize

Love is never easy
Dreams are always hard to hold
Love is never easy
But it's more precious than gold
More precious than gold
More precious than gold

Love is forever
Until the day that it ends
Love can just be for lovers
Love can be for friends

So don't give up looking
And don't be afraid to fall
Cause when you find that one love
You'll know it's worth it all

Love is never easy
Dreams are always hard to hold
Love is never easy
But it's more precious than gold
More precious than gold
More precious than gold

Love is never easy
Dreams are always hard to hold
Love is never easy
But it's more precious than gold
More precious than gold
More precious than gold

// Waiting For The Sun To Shine //

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been throwing a lot of good love away now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been throwing a lot of good love away now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

Oh I've been standing underneath a dark cool cloud now
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine on my heart again

// Good Friends //

Feeling one another's joy and sorrow
Dreams today may come true tomorrow
Good friends
Close together like they're bookends
Feeling what the other one is feeling
They never seem to be without
Those little things to laugh about

Good friends
They have the kind of love
That only deepens
It's something that you rarely find worth keeping
Oh people even new ones come
You're lucky if you find just one good friend

And we say goodbye
Knowing what we have will fade away
We'll meet another time
Another day
My friend

Good friends
Their paths may never come together again
But in their hearts
They're on a road with no end
Where life will take us who can tell
Guess it's time to say farewell
My friend

Good friends
You never will forget
Your good friends
