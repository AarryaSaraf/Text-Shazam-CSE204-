// So, So, So Long //

Yeah-yeah-yeah
Mmm-mmm-mmm

You know it seems like I've loved you forever
Who could be closer than you and I
People even say we're so much alike
But they don't know why

I've been lovin' you so long
That I know every move you make
Every breath you take
What I feel is so strong
Sometimes I don't know where I end
And where you begin
(And/Oh) you make me so happy
Feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't wanna miss
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long

So fine - so real - so right
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Oooooo-oooohh

Oh darlin', don't think for a minute
Time could ever steal the thrill away
You still got the power to be my man
And you know you can

I've been lovin' you so long
That I know every move you make
Every breath you take
What I feel is so strong
Sometimes I don't know where I end
And where you begin
(And/Oh) you make me so happy
Feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't wanna miss
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long

So good - so fine - so real - and so right
Oh, I wanna keep it so good
So, so, so long
(So long - so long)
So good - so fine - so real - so right
(So good - so fine - so long)
So, so, so long-ooh
(So good - so fine - so long)
So, so, so long - Uhh!

// Sunday Kind Of Love //

I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know
It's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

And I want a - a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And hopin' to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms needs someone to invoke
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love - oh yeah
Yeah, I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
A Wednesday or a Thursday
Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothin' baby
But I want a Sunday kind of love

// New Fool At An Old Game //

You sure know what you're doin'
Holdin' me this way
And I'll go where you lead me
Anywhere you say
You've got me where you want me
So Darlin' please be kind
Before you take it all
And I make that final fall
You've got to keep in mind

(That) I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school tryin' to find my way
But I don't know the rules, (so) teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game

Well maybe I'm a dreamer
Or maybe I'm naive
But when you say you love me
I start to believe
That coal can turn to diamonds
And this night will never end
But if it isn't so and I cry when you go
You've got to understand

(That) I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school tryin' to find my way
But I don't know the rules, (so) teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game

// You're The One I Dream About //

I caught you smiling at me again out of the corner of my eye
It isn't easy when I have to pretend that you're just another guy
I can't let anyone ever know
I can't let my feelings show

'Cause you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

Whenever you are close to me my heart just won't be still
I hope that no one else can see the way you make me feel
If only I didn't have to hide all this loving I hold inside

'Cause you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight If we could somehow be together,

I know this love of ours would last forever.
So you're the one I dream about when I fall asleep at night
And you're the one I think about when he turns out the light
Now it's so hard to live without you're love to hold me tight
How I wish that he was you tonight

// Silly Me //

Funny how love comes and goes
With the tears that fill my life does it show
So listen to my heart beat once again
Because of you I hope this feeling never ends

Silly me
I fell in love again
We started out as friends
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before
Foolish me
Should I have closed the door
Promised, even swore to never love this way
Oh foolish me

They say that love's a chance you take
You know I've had my share
But when the nights get oh so cold I need you there
They say that love's a chance you take
You know I've had my share
But when the nights get oh so cold I need you there

Silly me
I fell in love again
We started out as friends
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before
Foolish me

// Respect //

What you want
Baby I got it
What you need
Do you know I got it
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home
Hey, baby - when you get home
Hey, mister

I ain't gonna do you wrong
While you're gone
I ain't gonna do you wrong
'Cause I don't wanna
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home
Hey, baby - when you get home
Yeah

I'm up to givin' all my money
And all I'm askin' in return honey
Is to give me my propers when you get home
Yeah, baby - when you get home
Yeah

Ooooooh
Your kisses: sweeter than honey
Guess what - so is my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give me some respect when you get home
Hey, baby - give it to me
When you get home

Now
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care of T.C.B.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
A little respect
Hey baby
All the time you keep on tryin'
You're runnin' out, fool
And I ain't lyin'

Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-respect
When you come home
Or you might walk in
And find out I'm not alone
I've got to have a little respect
Oooh, baby - hey, baby
R-E-S-P-E-C-T!

// Do Right By Me //

Sometimes you treat me so cruel I don't think I can take it
Sometimes you hurt me so bad, I just wanna die
But in a moment like this
With a tender touch and a lover's kiss
You put all of my pain aside and I say to you with my eyes

Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong

It feels so good to be so close like we were when we started
Oooh back when the troubles were few and the loving was blind
Funny how people so close
Know the things to say that can hurt the most
Baby why can't we just be kind and capture this moment in time

Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong

Do Right (Do right)
By Me (By Me)
Hmmmm Baby, baby, baby
Do Right (Do right)
By Me (By Me) oooh (Do right)
Baby, baby, (By Me ) baby
Do right (Do right)
By Me (By Me) (Do right)
Oooohhh (Do right) oooh (By me)
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong

// I Know How He Feels //

When I heard that familiar voice
My heart stopped dead in its tracks
Across the room I could see him there
A ghost from my past
But he's too caught up to notice me
She must be his new love
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much
It's just

I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
'Cause I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
(And) I know how he feels

As long as I kept him out of sight
I kept from goin' out of my mind
Tried to believe that leavin' him
Was somehow justified
But tonight there's no denying
What a love like his is worth
He once looked at me
The way he's lookin' at her
What a lucky girl

I know how he feels
How warm his touch is
Oh, how he feels
How soft his kiss is
And it cuts right down to the bone
'Cause I let him go
I know how he cares
How strong his love can be
When he believes its real
Oh, I've been there
(And) I know how he feels

And it's killin' me
Oh, I know how he feels

// Wish I Were Only Lonley //

When you ain't got nobody, then nobody ever says goodbye
You don't have to wait for someone to make you laugh or make you cry
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you
I sleep in a bed so empty, it's an emptiness no one can fill.

I may have to go on living, but life without you ain't no thrill
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you

Well whoever said it's better to love and to lose
Well he ought to be right here in my shoes
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely then maybe
I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you

// Every Time You Touch Her //

Do you hold her all night long
Do you sing her our love song
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak, oh darlin'
Do you promise her the moon
Does she think loves coming soon
Does she know each move is made from memory, oh darlin'

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me
When she reaches out for you ,the same way my arms do

Does she know the truth your love belongs to me, oh baby
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart
Do you close your eyes so she will never see, oh baby

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me

Nights were never made to spend alone I can wish you love, but I can't wish you gone
Do you hold her all night long
Do you sing her our love song
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak, oh darlin'

Every time you touch her (Every time)
Every time you touch her think of me
