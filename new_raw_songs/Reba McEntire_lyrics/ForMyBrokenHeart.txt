// For My Broken Heart //

There were no angry words at all
As we carried boxes down the hall
One by one we put them in your car
Nothing much for us to say
One last goodbye and you drove away
I watched your tail-lights
As they faded in the dark
I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
So I laid down on the couch instead

Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But oh this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

Clocks still tickin, life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I've got to face
You call to see if I'm ok
Look out the window and I just say

Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But oh this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

I guess the world ain't gonna stop
For my broken heart

// Is There Life Out There //

She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready
Now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
But now she's just wonderin'
What she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more

Is there life out there
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wonderin
Is there life out there

She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how
To live for today
She's dyin' to try something foolish
Do something crazy
Or just get away
Something for herself for a change

Is there life out there
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wonderin
Is there life out there

There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then
She looks out the window and wonders again

Is there life out there
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wonderin
Is there life out there

Is there life out there
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wonderin
Is there life out there

// Bobby //

Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head
A little boy, dressed in blue, was standing at the rail
He said "I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell"
They put Bobby in a jail with forty other men
They all knew what he had done, they were glad to take him in
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife
How they loved each other, and how he took her life
Day after day, he sat alone
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song (he'd sing)

Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here...without you

The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored
Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line
And the one about the man who sits alone
Year after year, singing his song (he'd sing)

Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here...without you

The young man drove his car up, and parked outside the gate
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait
When the gaurd brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too
And when the guard left the two of them alone
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song

Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
You have taught me not to fear what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here...without you

// He's In Dallas //

He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas
And he captured my Appalachian heart
I was so naive that I believed him
When he promised we'd never be apart

So we packed and pulled a U-Haul down to Dallas
A year went by and the baby came along
Then his old friends and the night life came between us
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone

I'm staring out the window through these teardrops
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia
He's in Dallas without us tonight

Oh, Lord I hate to break the news to mama
She's gettin on in years and worries so
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas
And gave him another chance right now I just don't know

I'm staring out the window through these teardrops
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia
He's in Dallas without us tonight

He said I'll make your dreams come true in Texas
He's in Dallas without us tonight

// All Dressed Up (With Nowhere To Go) //

The sign says, "families welcome"
At the Oaks Retirement Home
But mostly, no one comes 'cept on the weekends
Ruby Wilson lives in 303
Where she spends most her time
But it's almost noon on Sunday
And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine

She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves
She's all dressed up
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes
Some days sure are lonely days
And time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up
With nowhere to go

As Ruby watches all the others
Leaving with their families
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner
She says she's expecting company
They're just running late
But, the nurse knows the truth too well
She just sighs and walks away

She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves
She's all dressed up
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes
Some days sure are lonely days
And time can move so slow
When you're all dressed up
With nowhere to go

// The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia //

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink for he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
He said "Hi what's new"
And Wo said "Sit down I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy Seth
Now, he got mad and he saw red
Andy said boy don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth I've been with her myself

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Andy got scared and left the bar
Walkin' on home cause he didn't live far you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must've left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make

He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lyin' on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag em down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"

The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it

That's the night the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheatin' wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

That's the night the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

// Buying Her Roses //

I took him for granted
Now looking back at it
He's not the only one to blame
Between the jobs and the kids
Wasn't much time for him
We let the fire slip away from the flame

Guess I shouldn't be surprised
But as hard as I try
I can't believe it's happened to me
But I know where he's at
And I know it's a fact
I'd have to be blind not to see

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

Should I put up a fight
Does it matter who's right
Should I ruin my life or my pride
Can we save what we had
And if he comes back
Will I ever get it out of my mind

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

What'll I do if he goes
What'll I do if he goes

// The Greatest Man I Never Knew //

The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon

The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
And now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had

Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
Has been dead almost a year
He was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew

// I Wouldn't Go That Far //

I'll never forget that night long ago
When he drove me down that old dusty road
He took me as far as I'd ever been
He wanted me and I wanted him
But I'd always been told I shouldn't give in

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

He was so patient, he didn't give up
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love
He asked me for forever, I asked him to wait
To please understand these dreams I must chase
Though it was a promise I wanted to make

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

After all these years. I saw him again
He had his wife and his family with him
He said he was proud of all my success
He guessed both of us had found happiness

I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

Yes, I knew he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

// If I Had Only Known //

If I had only known
It was the last walk in the rain
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I would hold your hand
Like a life line to my heart
Underneath the thunder we'd be warm
If I had only known
It was our last walk in the rain

If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again
I'd memorize each thing you ever said
And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
Keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known
I'd never hear your voice again

You were the treasure in my hand
You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware I foolishly believed
That you would always be there
But then there came a day
And I turned my head and you slipped away

If I had only known
It was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me
I would look into your eyes
And make sure you know my love
For you goes on and on
If I had only known
If I had only known
The love I would've shown
If I had only known
