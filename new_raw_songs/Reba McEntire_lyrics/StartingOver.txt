Album: StartingOver

// Talking In Your Sleep //

Three o'clock in the mornin'
And it looks like it's gonna be another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams and gettin' very low
Wonderin' what I can do

Maybe I'm bein' foolish
'Cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talkin' in you sleep
Sleeping in your dreams, with some sweet lover
Holdin' on so tight lovin' her the way
You used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep
With lovin' on your mind

Maybe I'm bein' foolish
'Cause I haven't heard you mention anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure it's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

'Cause you've been talkin' in you sleep
Sleeping in your dreams, with some sweet lover
Holdin' on so tight lovin' her the way
You used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep
With lovin' on your mind

'Cause you've been talkin' in you sleep
Sleeping in your dreams, with some sweet lover
Holdin' on so tight lovin' her the way
You used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep
With lovin' on your mind

// Please Come To Boston //

He said please come to Boston
For the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends
And they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
I said no, boy would you come home to me

(And) I said, ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

He said, please come to Denver
With the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains
So far we can't be found
And throw I love you echos
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
Until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said no boy won't you come home to me

(And) I said, ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

Now that drifter's word
Goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams
He's lost or found
And all that I ain't got
He's still needs to lean to
Somebody he can sing to

He said please come to L.A.
To live forever
A California life alone
Is just too hard to build
I live in a house that
Looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A.
I just said no
Boy, won't you come home to me

(And) I said, ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down
L.A. ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold
And there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee

I'm the number one fan
of the man from Tennessee
Tennessee

// On My Own //

So many times I said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Somethin' in my heart always knew
I'd be lying there beside him

On my own, On my own, On my own
So many promises never should be spoken
Now you know what loving him costs
Now you're even talkin' divorce
And you weren't even married

On my own
Once again I'm
One more time by myself

No one said it would be easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believe in love now here I stand
You wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I could have told you
That losing him would cut like a knife
He walked out and there went your life
I don't want to live without him

On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself
On my own
You've got to find out where you belong again
On my own
You've got to learn how to be strong again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone by myself

You've got to find out where you belong again
Your hear is saying that it's time again
And I know you're gonna shine again

// I Won't Mention It Again //

I know you're tired of being all I ever wanted
You no longer feel the love I have for you
What happens now, what will I do with all the memories
And the dreams of all the things we'll never do

But I won't mention it again
I won't think about tomorrow
Just let it happen
Live each hour day by day
But let me tell you before you go, how much I love you
Then I won't mention it again
I won't mention it again

I feel my life
Has reached an early sign of autumn
In my heart the leaves are falling, love is cold
And everything that once was warm and new is gone now
Leaving nothing but this hunger in my soul

// You're No Good //

Feelin' better
Now that we're through
Feelin' better
'Cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson
It left a scar
But now I see
How you really are

You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good

Broke a heart
Gentle and true
Left a man
Over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness
On bended knee
But I wouldn't blame him
If he said to me

You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good

I'm tellin' you now baby
That I'm going my way
Forget about you baby
'Cause I'm leaving today

// Ring On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands //

I stood before God, my family and friends
And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again
Only him

As pure as my gown of white I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love him till the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

// Five Hundred Miles Away From Home //

Tear drops fell on mama's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home

// Starting Over Again //

Mama moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way

And all the king's horses
and all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again

Starting over again
Where should they begin
'Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
and the kids are all grown
And the whole word cries

He got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's schemin' big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Sortin' out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty odd years

Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end

What will the neighbors say
They're talkin' talk it's small town news
They're facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries

And all the kings horses
And all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy back together again

// You Keep Me Hangin' On //

Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul need to be free
Now that you got your freedom baby
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free
You don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
So get out get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on

// By The Time I Get To Phoenix //

By the time I get to Phoenix he'll be risin'
He'll find the note I left hangin' on his door
And he'll laugh when he reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that man so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be workin'
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma he'll be sleepin'
He'll turn softly and call my name out low
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him
Though time and time I've tried to tell him so
Oh, he just didn't know
I would really go

I would really go
