// How Blue //

How Blue (how Blue) can you make me
How long till I heal
How Can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel

Oh honey why did you leave me
Ain't you got a heart left in your chest
I swear to you that I'm dyin'
'Cause my mind won't let my body rest

How Blue (How Blue) can you make me
How long till I heal
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel

If I sink any lower I'll go under
If I cry anymore I'll go blind
No there ain't no relief for this missing you grief
How long can you torture my mind

How Blue (How Blue) can you make me
How long till I heal
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel
How can I go on loving you when you're gone
How Blue (How Blue) can I feel

// That's What He Said //

You tell me that you're always gonna love me
But that's what he said
That's what he said

And forever is a word
That should mean something
But that's what he said
That's what he said

You're telling me the same sweet things he told me
And in your eyes I see that same sweet glow
And did you say you'd never leave me lonely
Well that's what he said
That's what he said

You're telling me I've got to go on living
To open up my heart and just let go
And it's better to love and lose
Then live with nothing
But that's what he said
That's what he said

That's what he said
That's what he said

// I Want To Hear It From You //

If all our love is through
If you found someone new
Then I want to hear it from you

If there is no mistake
And if my heart must break
I want to hear it from you

Just the thought of losing you
Is more than I can stand
But this hurt would be much worse
If I heard it secondhand
If there's no hope at all
If my world must fall
I want to hear it from you

So tell me now
If things are not the way they used to be
I want to hear it from your lips
You owe that much to me

If all our love is through
If you found someone new
Then I want to hear it from you

// It's Not Over (If I'm Not Over You) //

You can tell everyone
Love is over and done
You can pack all your things and go

You can lie to yourself
And say that there's nothing left
But there's something that I like you to know

It's never really over
Even though you say we're through
You may be holding me
But can't you see
It's not over if I'm not over you

There's not much I can do
If it's over for you
I'll just wish you the best
When you leave
But you played such a part
In my life and in my heart
You'll always be part of me

It's never really over
Even though you say we're through
You may be holding me
But can't you see
It's not over if I'm not over you

// Somebody Should Leave //

It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here inthe silence
Putting off what must be said

I read a book you watch T.V.
As out love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids
And they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hopin somehow
We might need each other again

You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

If it as only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We just keep hopin
We might need each other again

// Everything But My Heart //

The bed is cold and empty in the morning light
I'm searching for my pride through tangled covers
And loneliness is not a very pretty sight
When you first discover

That it's over
A hard one to lose
Love hurts
It's sad but true
He wanted my arms around him
Oh without a doubt
He wanted my warm red lips
Soft on his mouth
He loved all of me
Except for one small part
He wanted everything
Everything but my heart

Love is not an easy word for me right now
Too much has happened to my feelings
It's gonna be rough not having him around
Until time has done some healing
And it's over
And I'm over you

Love hurts
It's sad but true
He wanted my arms around him
Oh without a doubt
He wanted my warm red lips
Soft on his mouth
He loved all of me
Except for one small part
He wanted everything
Everything but my heart

// Don't You Believe Him //

He can give you a reason to live if he wants to
He can make you forget other loves that you had known
He has two lips and two arms that thrill you as very few do
And if you want him to give them to you just ask and he will

Don't you believe him
I did and soon he'll be leaving me
No don't believe him if you do
Then soon he'll be leaving you too

He can tell you a lie you believe if he has to
And you'll trust me till time and the tide both stand still
He can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things that he won't do
But be careful for when you're not looking he will

Don't you believe him
I did and soon he'll be leaving me
No don't believe him if you do
Then soon he'll be leaving you too

// Before I Met You //

Well I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you

Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
But that was before I met you

Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
Darling that was before I met you

// He's Only Everything //

In the eyes of the world he's only an ordinary man
But there's a million and one things the eyes of the world never see
He may walk the same
He may talk the same
As a million others do
Oh but you'd see him as I do if his heart had eyes for you

He's only everything
Only everything
He's as real as the thrill I feel
When he walks through my dreams
He's the one I hold
When my world grows cold
And needs a touch of spring
Or a song to sing
Yes in these eyes of mine
Lord he's only everything

He's only everything
Only everything
He's as real as the thrill I feel
When he walks through my dreams
He's the one I hold
When my world grows cold
And needs a touch of spring
Or a song to sing
Yes in these eyes of mine
Lord he's only everything

Yes in these eyes of mine
Lord he's only everything

// You've Got Me (Right Where You Want Me) //

Darling could I just have one moment with you
We're here all alone just us two
Let me try to tell you in a few little words
How my heart feels about you
If there were no rainbow I'd paint one for you
And I'd teach the robin a new song or two
Then I'd fight forever
And hand it to you
Oh I wish there was more could do

You've got me right where you want me
It's true I'm right in the palm of your hand
You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want to be right where I am

You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want be right where I am
