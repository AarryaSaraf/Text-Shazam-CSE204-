// Everything That You Want //

In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
You told me
I was everything you wanted me to be

Then summer was over
And the nights grew cold
You got restless
And hard to hold
I tried to be
Everything you wanted me to be

Now you keep staring
At that open door
You got what you wanted
And you still want more
Well look at me
I'm everything you wanted me to be

If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
And if I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everyhing that you want me to be

In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
Remember me?
I was everything you wanted me to be

If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
And if I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everyhing that you want me to be

I'll ever be
Everyhing that you want me to be
I'll ever be
Everyhing that you want
I'll ever be
Everyhing that you want
I'll ever be
Everything that you want

// Read My Mind //

A penny for my thoughts you say
You want to know what I could be thinking
But as I speak the music starts to play
And the words just somehow slip away

Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind, read my mind

One look from you and one look at me
I'm trembling like a little girl
I tell myself if I can just believe
Any day now you'll fall in love with me

Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind, read my mind

Tell me if you feel the same way I do
And tell me that I'm not mistakenly taken with you

You're all I ever wanted in a man
You see, all I need is everything you are to me
If you could somehow read my mind
You would see what I can't seem to say
If only you could, if you would read my mind
Read my mind

// I Won't Stand In Line //

You told me I was one in a million
Everything you wanted in this world
Every time I turn around
I hear tell you paint the town
With one of this million other girls

Oh, watcha do to me is not the question
I swear I felt the magic from the start
I see the promise of a legendary love
But I am not about to share your heart

I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take a number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind
I won't stand in line

Oh, how long do you think that you can handle
Keeping all those hearts up in the air
Don't you know in time you're bound to stumble
And when that day comes it won't be my affair

I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take a number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind
I won't stand in line

I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take a number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind
I won't stand in line

Oh, I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line
I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
I won't stand in line

// I Wish That I Could Tell You //

How do you tell someone you're letting go
I wish that I could tell you
But you're asking me things that I don't know
I wish that I could tell you
The words that I would say
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside
While the silence in between
Tells me everything that you deny
I don't know how to help you
I wish that I could tell you
How to tell me goodbye

I don't know how you leave it all behind
I wish that I could tell you
Is it true a heart heals itself with time
I wish that I could tell you
How do you choose
Do you hurt 'em with the truth or with a lie
Where do you go to find the courage
You know I could never find
I don't know how to help you
I wish that I could tell you
How to tell me goodbye

Where do you turn, where do you go
When you've finally reached the end of the road
How do you say it I just don't know
When it comes to leaving you're on your own

How do you tell someone you're letting go
I wish that I could tell you
I wish that I could tell you

// She Thinks His Name Was John //

She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then

But there is one she can't put her fingers on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams

And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John

// Why Haven't I Heard From You //

Back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now: Darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

Well there's no problem gettin' to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding and call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man he told me that my phone is working fine
And I've come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you thru
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now: Darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And a thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothin' about

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now: Darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now: Darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

// And Still //

Thousands of people live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there on that busy street
Those feelings came back again
There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He walked up to me, looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

He said how have you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doing fine
We talked as the people rushed by
We laughed about old times and all we went thru
That's when he hugged me and said I've missed you

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we've gotta go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
Then they walked away

And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still

// The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter //

She came in lookin' good and lookin' around
She's checkin' out every man in the room right now
Don't go tellin' her about right or wrong
She's been alone way to long

The heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lastin' comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

She hears him say "Hey, can I buy you a drink?"
And sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring
She knows he's dealin' her a dangerous hand
The consequences of a one night stand

The heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lastin' comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

From somewhere deep inside she tells him no
Before she starts to cry she turns to go

The heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lastin' comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of a love in sight

// I Wouldn't Wanna Be You //

You don't have a clue
You're so far gone
He's got you dancin' to
A siren's song
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be

You're not the first he's drawn
To his flame
He means to do you wrong
He has no shame
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be you

It's easy to understand
How you could fall so hard
You're not the only one
He's taken in and torn apart

Won't say I told you so
But I'm afraid it's true
You're about to go
What I went through
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be you

// Till You Love Me //

I sent you roses, I warned you I would
Do all that I could to show you the way that I feel
Please, don't say I'm wasting my time
I've got nothin' but time so I'll do all that I can to catch
That ghost of a chance

The sunlight, the moonlight
Are beyond my control
And there are stars in the heavens
That I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power
Then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me
Till you love me

I looked in your eyes, so bright and so blue
And that's when I knew that you could be mine
If good things come to those who will wait
Well, I guess I can wait if that's what I have to do
Oh, it's worth it for you

The sunlight, the moonlight
Are beyond my control
And there are stars in the heavens
That I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power
Then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me
Till you love me
