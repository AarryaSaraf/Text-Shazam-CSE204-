// Climb That Mountain High //

Red sun a-rising, over the hill
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth
This could be the day I finally find my way out

I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain

How I arrived here, heaven only knows
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose
To spend my life here, is more than I can do
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true

I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain

If I stay here forever
What will I have to show
But if I make it over
Then everyone will know
I'm gonna climb that mountain high

I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain

// Rumor Has It //

I overheard a conversation your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard

Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you

This town's so small a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears but I see it in your eyes
The stories goin' 'round this town aren't lies

Rumor has it she has you
Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you

Whoa....rumor has it she loves you...

// Waitin' For The Deal To Go Down //

Oh, you've sold me you hold me
You've told me I'll be getting all your love
You can go wrong
If you hold on for so long
Just because you hate to give up
Do I love you ooh ooh I'm afraid I do
Do you love me, once upon a time
I was sure I knew

I don't like what I been thinkin'
If it's true, Oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here
Waitin' for the deal to go down

I get lonely and lonely is only
The hardest way to spend the night
Then you call me
You call me and stall me
And swear you're gonna make it right
So I hang on
Oh that's just the way things are
But the pay off I been waitin' for
Just might break my heart

I don't like what I been thinkin'
If it's true, Oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here
Waitin' for the deal to go down

Is there someone out there I don't know about
Convince me babe beyond the shadow of a doubt

I don't like what I been thinkin'
If it's true, Oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here
Waitin' for the deal to go down
Waitin' for the deal to go down

// You Lie //

We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
But, Oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside 'cause I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice

You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie 'til you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

How long until you just can't go on
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you want to do
Oh but you don't know, you don't know
If it's the right thing to do

You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie 'til you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

// Now You Tell Me //

What a surprise
Never thought I'd hear from you
Whatever made you call
From out of the blue
What did you say
I must be hearing things
Things that I never thought would come from you

Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long to say those words to me
Oh you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that's there's somebody new

I think you should know
There's someone here with me
O bet he can tell you must be someone dear to me
So I better go
'Cause you still get to me
Just when I thought I was over you
This is all I need

Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long to say those words to me
Oh you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that's there's somebody new

// Fancy //

I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, run-down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard-pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down."

Mama dabbled a little bit of perfume on my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, "Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick,
And the baby's gonna starve to death."

She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said,
"To thine own self be true."
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', "Mama, what do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy,
And they'll be nice to you."

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Now your mama's gonna move you uptown."

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down."
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down."

It wasn't long after that benevolent man took me in off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five-room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat
And then I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That would call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Now your Mama's gonna move you uptown."

Well, I guess she did

// Fallin' Out Of Love //

He says he loves her...what can you say to that
He's made up his mind and there ain't nothin' you can do
And as you swallow hard...maybe you drive all night
Tryin' to figure out where the whole thing started goin' wrong
And in the silence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now

Fallin' out of love and back into your life
Pullin' your heart out from under the knife
Closin' the door on all those dreams you used to know
Fallin' out of love and back on your feet
Turnin' away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

That's when he called you up out of the blue one day
And you know he thinks he's talkin' to the girl you used to be
So when you tell him he's just a memory
Ain't it funny how his voice cracks when you're sayin' goodbye
And in the silence something begins to unravel
He never knew you like he'll be knowing you now

Fallin' out of love and back into your life
Pullin' your heart out from under the knife
Closin' the door on all those dreams you used to know
Fallin' out of love and back on your feet
Turnin' away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go
He said he loved her

// This Picture //

That old picture with my arm around you
Tore it to pieces this morning at two
Score one for me
I took your portrait off the living room wall
Then I started on the ones in the hall
Had a bonfire
I decided it was time to forget
So I got rid of every picture you left

But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
This picture

I walk alone down a crowded street
And see your face in everybody I meet
When's it gonna end
Every single night I crawl into bed
Hoping sleep will keep you out of my head
I should know better
Everytime I turn around there you are
I never thought your memory would go this far

But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
This picture

But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
This picture

// You Remember Me //

They say no one should call on you
Unless She's your permission to
But me, I just came anyway
I couldn't care less what you say
'Cause I know you from long before
You hid behind a stained glass door
And walked around
And looked your old friends up and down

But anyway, I thought I'd come give you a look
At where you're from and let you know
I still recall what a child you are underneath it all

You remember me the funny way I cry
The funny way I sit there when someone says goodbye
The funny way I wind up lost when someone sets me free
Why sure, you remember me

Well, I won't take up your whole day
I've said about all I have to say
I guess I'll be moving on
I know you'll be glad to see me gone
Tonight is our last night in town
So don't worry 'bout me hanging around
Tomorrow night it's Calgary
And you'll be good and rid of me

You remember me the funny way I cry
The funny way I sit there when someone says goodbye
The funny way I wind up lost when someone sets me free
Why sure, you remember me

You remember me the funny way I cry
The funny way I sit there when someone says goodbye
The funny way I wind up lost when someone sets me free
Why sure, you remember me

// That's All She Wrote //

Well it looks like you're alone again
I heard about your misery
She took you around the bend
And now you're coming back to me

That's all she wrote
Forget about her let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so

Think I know what happened late last night
I can tell by looking in your eyes
She spelled it out in black and white
And she left no room for compromise

That's all she wrote
Forget about her let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so

I could see it from a mile away
But I don't wanna rub it in
All I want is just to hear you say
That you're ready, are you ready
To love me again

That's all she wrote
Forget about her let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so

We can put all behind us now
Let's pretend it never happened
We'll forget about the pain somehow
If you're ready, are you ready
To love me again

That's all she wrote
Forget about her let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
