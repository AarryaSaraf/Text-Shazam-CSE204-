// C.S.I.E. //

Free Nation
Free Everything
Niggas in the Chi got goals they can't attain
They either spit or break it and flip it like Boldy James
Chef it like Gordon Ramsay, 7 on they side
They keep a Ben Gordon handy, keep a Ben Gordon handy
Dandy-lions in my freshly row
And my phone stay buzzing, all these pesky hoes
Be trynna to chill with him
Fuck 'em, mind on my money
Cops, duck 'em
Grind for this honey
Cause life ain't as sweet as they say
So niggas wrist twist when they pre-heating the yay
Me? Shit, I just sprinkle all the kief on the haze
And the Ron Brons rocking pre-Heats like they J's
Couple niggas I grew up with, playing 2k
Red Kool-Aid, with a Panera Bread souffle
I'm cold chilling and pilling leaves off rare bouquetes
Nothing major, something like the Huntsville Stars
Or an undecided student bumming rides in your car
Like the flies in your car, these niggas rolling down the windows
Trynna catch a breeze in this Free shit
But if you wasn't fucking with us since the prefix
When the boat rock, all you shallow niggas gon' be seasick

Can't stress it enough
Just a chill ass nigga from the Chi, homie
Can't stress it enough

// Like A Villian //

[Falcon:]
And we ain't never really had to party to get it popping
But we can, and we will
Just called a couple of my closest people ever we don't need everybody
It's the weekend, and we chill

[Mick Jenkins:]
Yeah, started calling it the high life
Everybody want it all, I just want the highlights
Laughing with my homies and we blazing to the Chi lights
On the roof staring at the stars and the twilight
Yeah, chilled evenings and cold Fanta
I would take that over vodka and pole dancers
Niggas ask why I just give a cold answer
This is life without the flash like an old camera
Cause popping bottles like a fad now
So I pass on the glass bring the grass around
Tell a couple jokes words to the class clowns
Blowing hash putting ketchup on my hash brown

[Falcon:]
I've just been trying to chill all day
I've just been waiting to get a feel all day
Of what it would be like to live this day
As if this day could be my last

[Mick Jenkins:]
Damn
I shouldn't be doing this
Kind of apprehensive still
I so fucking new to this
People say I got a chance
I know there's some truth to it
Cause they are on another level
I'm too high to stoop to it
Fuck no
I'm tired of the average
Writing down my life now
Gotta do it passionate
Documenting everything
From rolling it to passing it
Until I'm seeing double and I marry Kate and Ashley
Teamwork, now tell me how that dream works
Cause the free is hotter than sleep
In 90 degree weather with no AC a blanket and three shirts
Long sleeve right next to a heater
Nigga, letting up means I let them down
If you square I don't never even let them around
Most times it's just me and Hibachi
Climing on the cloud like we never even felt the ground
So say wassup, give a pound
Everybody think we're so much cooler than we are
Stare's all we get when we come around
So we gone
Cold motherfucking chilling with the stars

[Falcon:]
And we ain't never really had to party to get it popping
But we can, and we will
Just called a couple of my closest people ever we don't need everybody
It's the weekend, and we chill

Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen

Fuck yo, designer on my momma I get fly without them labels
15 minute savings, stacking paper with no staples
Geico wonder how I do it
Shot from every angle, yet this style is so congruent
I make these niggas mad when I'm dressing like they dads, out the 80's
Rekindle that fire, now I'm sparking all the interest with they ladies
Like where you get your clothes nigga, what you call your style boy
Can you take me shopping to some places I ain't never been?
Emani found that Dolce and Gabbana and Benny rocking the shit up out that letterman
Letters falling off but never ever is cheddar falling off
No never ever is cheddar falling off, nigga

And I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That wire so fly as hell but fuck it, I'm on a budget
Man fuck it, I'm on a budget
And, I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That wire so fly as hell but fuck it

Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen

Tell them, fuck yo, designer on my momma 'til I'm rolling in that dollar
Liable to find your ho some Oval and Taiga
For like three bucks, Ralph Lauren slacks, I cuff the crease up
Like denim off your ass, boy why it so tough to keep up?
Probably cause of how I creep up
Dress to kill, I'm goin' impress
Comme des GarÃ§ons kiss my ass, [?] fuck yo' fresh
And if your heart ain't in it, nigga fuck yo' chest
And if they horses on it, fuck yo' vest
I'm on that Brooklyn Cirque Du Soleil shit
With a pair of killer gloves on some OJ shit
Stepping on the scene on some probate shit
And I dress it like I spit it on some Colgate shit

And I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That wire so fly as hell but fuck it, I'm on a budget
Man fuck it, I'm on a budget
And, I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That wire so fly as hell but fuck it

Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen

Fuck the mall

Fuck the mall

Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Free shit

Save yo' money nigga, save yo' money

// Purple Snowflakes //

Snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes
Purple snowflakes

My cousin used to cop a gram every couple hours
Watch him smoke
Watch him break it down
Watch him roll it up
Watch him light it then
Watch him toke
Inhale in the middle of his chest then ash then hold it there
He'd be high, penguin fly
I was just another polar bear
In there, trying to be the better man
In there, tripping off his second hand
Always thought he was the stupidest
But he made the shit look so lucrative
Like how you support your habit nigga
Money gone before it come your way
Middle of the Chi-town
Some of bitches outside
But he inside off them snowflakes
Crazy right? Bedroom getting kind of hazy
Like he had hazel eyes
But whenever it was red he played his shit smooth like baby wipes
And he made me like the process of it
Even tried to show me how to pearl a blunt
Was never really gonna smoke it though, oh no
I just want to learn how to roll it up
Yeah, roll up them...

Snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes
Purple snowflakes

Now this nigga, first time
My first pull, it was big as fuck
Tried to act like the shit didn't phase me
After a while I didn't give a fuck
Now I'm sparking a couple blunts a day
Quickly moved up the hierarchy
Rolling raws with that undertaking
You can't see my eyes hardly
Like how how you support your habit nigga
Money gone before it come your way
Middle of a hunt, still summer
And the only way to stay cool is to roll in snowflakes
Trainwreck, God's gift
Shouts to Stock for that
Why we ain't no brake lights
We got four O's
You gonna fly high in that Audi
Niggas getting rowdy turn that music up
Call a couple of your closest friends
Got a gram of that purple stuff
About half a fifth of that Amsterdam
Let them fall, let them fall
Snowflakes keep falling
And my music loud and we playing around
So my neighbours they keep calling
But we like fuck it though

Snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes
Purple snowflakes

Fuck it though, let them fall
Snowflakes never hit the ground
Neighbours call, music up
Loud as fuck and we playing around
Fuck it though, let them fall
Snowflakes never hit the ground
Never

// Kewl Niggas //

This is for my niggas, my niggas
Love for my niggas, ride for my niggas
This is for my niggas, my niggas
My niggas

Back, you ain't never met a iller crew
The realest niggas middle finger to the cynical
Motherfuckers who ain't riding with the team
Shouts to all the niggas that are riding with the team
They tell me you look tired I'm as tired as it seems
Cause you don't really sleep when you're trying to live a dream
Nah, you just party with your niggas
Parlay with the girls, stop and take a picture
For the niggas who just know you about to blow up
The only ones eating all this food for thought
You're sick enough to throw up
See this is for the niggas who won't never want to grow up
Veyrons if pay on with a box of Fruit Roll-Ups, now hold up
Tell me we don't kick it
Tell me I ain't blowing money fast when I'm thriftin'
Tell me I ain't who they want to be
And that's why they hating
On a motherfucker just because he different, nigga listen

This is for my second-hand shopper, quarter-ounce coppers
OG3 and LA Dodger rockers
You're cool as fuck

And this is for my niggas with subs who be banging out classics
And honeys who got ass in the past tense
You're cool as fuck

This is for my niggas, my niggas
Love for my niggas, ride for my niggas
This is for my niggas, my niggas
My niggas

Back, if they ever call me jaded
This is for my niggas who was there before we made it
The homies who was down before the free was elevated
Now the free is escalating everybody want to stare
Things are getting sunny now these niggas want to share
But I can care less, they never impress
I could do it better coming off the top like hair, necks
Otherwise, I'm just posting with my niggas
Roll another blunt up while I'm joking with my niggas
Stepping through the door that I have opened with my niggas
And I'm trying to do this shit when I'm old as shit my nigga

Cause I'm pretty sure they love my style, love my sound
Love my team like I love Chi-town
That's why they're cool as fuck

And it's probably cause I rep my own, dress my own
Love my bros, middle finger to hoes
That's why we cool as fuck

This is for my second-hand shopper, quarter-ounce coppers
OG3 and LA Dodger rockers
You're cool as fuck

This is for my niggas, my niggas
Love for my niggas, ride for my niggas
This is for my niggas, my niggas
My niggas

// Mr. Jackson //

Take two

Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
I can blow it all and roll up something stupendous
Or coastin' in my car, cause niggas wanna go thriftin'
Or floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars
Stars... [x6]

Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
Smoking shit that is guaranteed to have you suspended
In mid air, can't feel my toes, my vision's impaired
Them other rappers in there, I'm comin' for they necks like a razor after chin hair
I been rare, like steaks that's undercooked
I stay under radar, that's why I'm overlooked
Can't see me, like Stevland Morris, better known as Stevie
Her fingers in my hair cause my grandma slept in a teepee
She like the way it feels, it get her wet when she pee-pee
I put it in so deeply, that's why she need me
And this

Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
I can blow it all and roll up something stupendous
Or coastin' in my car, cause niggas wanna go thriftin'
Or floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars
Stars... [x6]

// To The Melody //

But now love is so much better
And Lord knows if my words don't come together
Just listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there

[Hook:]
Just listen to the melody [x3]
Baby

A nigga feel like going in
Feel like letting out the bullshit I've been holding in
Music, school and money, on what should I be focusing
The jeopardy of choosing the wrong door and opening
Fuck it, take the music for a thousand, Alex
I'm tryna dress it right, I'm talking thousand island
I'm aiming for the pocket, I'm like a thousand linemen
I'm in the barbershop searching for the silver lining
Can someone tell me how much good will really come from this?
Is all that company gonna leave a nigga comfortless?
See Drake be talking bout it, how he let it come to this?
And if it's true then I don't know how he's functioning
But I'm thinking that's the only part you fear about it
Cause you can see my eyes gleaming when I hear about it
And everybody wanna flow when the boat ride
But it's like they all forget they got a fear of drowning

[Hook x3]

Lord knows they ain't never really had a chance
I'm just a killer that ain't never really got a plan
I just murder, whatever I do, murder nigga
I could have the white moving quicker than an avalanche
But I've never seen the purpose in moving a pound
When I can get the same paper from moving a noun
They tell me stop it, I'm laughing, they saying stop it
Bad bitches laugh this is just one big room full of clowns
I'm looking round like maybe I shouldn't be here
Fuck it I'll just stay and I'll have me a little feast here
And for dessert can somebody bring me a chocolate eclair
Those are one of my favorites, I'm eating until I make it
Lord knows I've been grinding too hard this year
Niggas gassed like I'm driving two cars in here
And even if they don't feel it, they felt the need to lie
So I'm thinking they thinking I'm going far this year
Trying to eat, fucking starving artist here

[Hook x3]

// Restless //

I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless

Restless as shit
Cause, niggas, it's about time the Free is noticed
We as boulders, shit, niggas bringing locusts to bug you, we is Moses
Three-inch focus, act like you ever see a motherfucker just like me before
Dress just like me before, throw ball so dope, they be telling me I'm slingin' raw
Bring along, all your niggas
They ain't enough, call more niggas
If you can't handle the heat, then leave the heat, don't call us royal niggas
Damn, I've been coy with niggas
On the real though, I'm about to spoil niggas
I rap that food for thought, better grab you a plate then wrap it in foil, nigga
Why we so restless?
All these wack niggas at the top about to fall
They call it asbestos
And all these niggas who ain't never want to talk wanna hang
Just call it a necklace, of fake niggas
And you don't really want me to break niggas
Spit a sixteen, every bar hit like a fist
What's that, like eight niggas?

I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
I don't know why

Restless as shit
Cause everybody wanna start listening
I'm cocky, watch me, spit it fresh, Listerine
Been trying to fill your shoes, my dawg, my foot is about to start blistering
Listen up, I gotta spot this flow, Mr. Clean
Turn it up, burn it up
We really just wanna see the roof go down
Weak niggas can't even speak my words, it'll leave jaws sore like a root canal
Motherfuckers such bad actors, they don't even know to act when the truth come out
Let the truth come out, and I'm gonna spit it, I'm gonna spit 'til the tooth come out
Why we so restless?
Like adrenaline has been injected
I'm reckless, you can hear it in my voice, inflection, don't test it
Bitch, life's a game of chess
And got my hands all her chest
It's amazing how these motherfuckers think I had denim
And I ain't even started on [?]

I don't why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless [x2]
(Free)
I don't why we so restless [x2]
(Ow)
I don't know why we so restless [x2]
