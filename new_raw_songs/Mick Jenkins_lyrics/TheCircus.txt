// Same Ol //

I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
I got bitches, I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
Yeah that's all I hear
Yeah that's all I hear
I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
I got bitches, I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
Yeah that's all I hear
Yeah that's all I hear

Well I got money too
And I got common sense
We all know niggas that got guns
I ain't gonna talk that shit my nigga
I'm on southside
On some parking shit my nigga
We not parallel
On some narcissistic shit I'm taking care of self
I be way too paranoid
I got on my Paramore
See it with some brand new eyes
I told you 'bout the Perrier
Told you you can catch me out in traffic off the Mary J
Bumping DJ Ferris getting carried away
I carry thrash on my situations damn near everyday
Writing all my sections with the city like who is he
If that nigga never keep it that real with me what's your story
All our shit like allegory
If you tell it nigga told me

I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
I got bitches, I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
Yeah that's all I hear
Yeah that's all I hear
I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
I got bitches, I got bitches, I got money, I got drugs
Yeah that's all I hear
Yeah that's all I hear

// Carefree //

I was off the drugs, I was off the drinks, I was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice

It just don't look like this
If you living carefree then you probably don't look like us
Damn nigga let me cook right quick, on the beach
Couple niggas we was cool and it's just about dusk
Shawty never smoked kush like this
On fire, it's music playin', grindin' on me
You know I had to push right back, reflex, respect
No suspect shit, came late
Groovy niggas missed the sunset
We ain't even give a fuck got the backwoods though dropped those niggas would've been upset
Only hit it two times 'cause I know that the papers more of her speed she could fuck with
And I like that shit, she don't duck shit but who's cool?
And I said we the one smoke some when the cops popped up
It was pop smoke, niggas proceeded to get on that fuck shit
I ain't worried 'bout dyin' for speaking my mind, they keep on callin' it tough shit
I ain't do too much, just rough shit
Whole time that really is way too much shit
Playin' that shit right, it's some tough shit
And they know just which one to fuck with
It's just some shit we stuck with

We was off the drugs, we was off the drinks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die

Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn family, give me space
So quick to shoot, no Devin Booker
Can't even look me in my face
Can't play it straight, these niggas crooks
They player hate, I'm on my shit
Pulled me over 'bout my whip
Like "How you get it?"
Bitch I bought it, took my ticket for the tints
That might not seem too intense
But I ain't with this in two months
The first day back, they on some shit
I can't let 'em steal my joy
See who my niggas is fuckin' with
Heard the whole squad at the beach
Guessin' we'll pull up and shit

We be off the drugs, we be off the drinks, we be off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, be with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice
Damn

We was off the drugs, we was off the drinks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die?

Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn nigga, give me space
Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn family, give me space
Quick to shoot, no Devin Booker
Can't even look me in my face

// The Light //

Oh, It's a gnat in here
Get out of here gnat
Got something you want to tell me gnat?
Cuff my nuts, place myself on house arrest
Locked in, judge, jury, bailiff, bet
When it rains I'm dry
Sun shines I'm wet
Push up demons fuck it doing bout 50 11 sets
Ignoring your texts like sweet babies who cry in the church
Oh if your partner got popped yesterday and school comes first
My favorite colors yellow maybe cause I'm yellow
And I got so much styles it's probably cause I'm ghetto
My mommy never cooked a cosby dinner
And often times I took a L for Mrs winters
But I'm getting off the subject
Off the boat got my luggae but the quote
Pack light styarts to echo through my mind
So I'm rushing now hushing now
Laid my suitcase down like prom night zipped it open started pulling out starting tossing memories socks, thoughts who pretend to be, boxer briefs, pants, pictures of frenemies killing me to make room, room, room, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things
Thought I bought a rollie but forget that I don't need it
Just let that holy water wash over my caesar dressing like that thursday in november
Know that they'll remember style, boil it then let it simmer down
We blowing smoke between the breeze
The twists are sengalese
No more backwoods blown we? of memories
We wired the intricacies of our logic
No hand in my pocket
Still got my hand on my weapon
He more malcom than martin a bit more baldwin than both
Need a cauldron for mixing a black man's soul into soup
So many? can't cope
You cracking jokes 'bout the soap
We more concerned with the truth
You niggas burning the booth these niggas burning the wick at both ends
Fade to black I'm ghosting in the light
Lately I been waking up at night trying to beat the day
Over confident I can't be issa rae
Make room, room, room, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things
I know what I know but you heard what you heard so you poked your head in got suspicion confirmed
Been on my feet for miles so my soul got some burn
Still its fuck how you feel on my bottle of pills
If you can't hold me down then you don't get the time
Yea yea Fame is less work nothing sacred no more
Either take what you want or you make what you earn
If I kill you I promise I'll pay for you first like oooh
If you love me grease my scalp with this 380 in my lap like oooh
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Use the answer to relapse, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things

// Flaunt //

Niggas wanna see me stunt
Niggas wanna see me talk my shit
Niggas wanna see me front
Niggs wanna see me flaunt my bitch

Spent 20 mins on the face lips mac'd up oh these bitches better know I'm dicking that down on the regular
Move the fuck around you a regular to me don't act up niggas talk loud out the jugular
Keep my head down out in public and I'm aced in the club
See you clowns in the publix you niggas fake with the love
Roll the pack up put it to my face and its big though
Snoop dogg snapping and we big loc'd out
Sitting on the small block smoking on a cigo like uhh
Niggas wanna see me stunt, huh
Niggas wanna see my talk my shit, right
Niggas wanna see me front
Niggs really wanna see me flaunt my
I don't even flex like that, on the regular

Dim sum on my plate

Now they telling me it's fake and I ain't even tryna brag, but
Niggas wanna see my talk my shit
Niggas wanna see me front
Niggs wanna see me flaunt my bitch
I don't even flex like that, on the regular
Betcha hear the muscle when I start my shit though
Pardon my shit
Hop out, homies keep asking me when I'm gonna pop out
Ohh niggas wanna see me stunt
Niggas wanna see my talk my shit
Niggas wanna see my Front, on em
Niggs wanna see me flaunt my bitch
I don't even flex like that, on the regular

// The Fit //

Sometimes it's just bout the fit
I need my shit with a taper
I can't quit I'm too legit
Dropping jewels niggas dying off the vapor
Needed paper I got paper need a stapler
I got habits I got problems got enablers
Peep the patterns picking swatches switching flavors
Sometimes that shit just not it
I need the real fuck the cap'n
I need An accurate description of what happened
A? look like them boys relaxing
What you stand on in them nikes I'm just checking
I respect the lighter flexing fuck a hypebeast
Niggas characters so often they come typecasted
Eddie murphy I ain't really lacking no character
Don't try to compare us
Its apparent we lacking in parallel
Just said what I said my nigga pklease don't try to paraphrase
I had to come off the carousel
Niggas is still on they high horse
Ain't gotta do nothing by force
Right handed nigga play high keys
Taking my talents to hockey
Flows is too icey somebody stop me
Sometimes niggas can't do shit
I'm watching mother fuckers copy
Niggas use stencils niggas ain't banksy
Backbone like number two pencils
I peep it eaerly niggas should thank me
Can't fuck with you cause of who you with
Sometimes it's just bout the fit
I need my shit with a taper
I can't quit I'm too legit
Dropping jewels niggas dying off the vapor
Needed paper I got paper need a stapler
I got habits I got problems got enablers
Peep the patterns picking swatches switching flavors
Sometimes that shit just not it
I need the real fuck the cap'n
I need An accurate description of what happened

// I'm Convinced //

Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Stand on my own ten need no co-defendants
Don't Need no inconsistencies if we gon roll together
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Not too much patience for the violations
From the same cloth It cut much deeper when it's my persuasion
Depend on when and where you asking me my occupation
Acknowledge haters always working how you knock a nigga
Betty crocker in the oven I can't wait that long
I'm gon wait that long I know somebody know the feeling
We did the floors we did the walls I do not want a ceiling
I want what's come to me and they gon try to cap the building
We got some spillage they won't pillage
I play Cappadonna
Big Daddy Kane ain't no half steppin with this black Madonna
Extract the charmer made some commas off my pain and suffering
The same ones round me been the bros since no was on the bluff
They know what's up
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Stand on my own ten need no co-defendants
Don't Need no inconsistencies if we gon roll together
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Need no convincing niggas know

// Different Scales //

Yea, In pole position, had to strip it down
Was rarely fucking with the vision they was feeding me the bread
Well come eleven and the water only trickle down
Needed pumperknickle wasn't fucking with the fickle minds
This shit would get bumpy over time if we pickle beets
They just want the hooks, got me out here fighting sickle cell
Niggas sound like crooks in front of cameras I hear crickets now
Have some art commissioned more than living off the ticket sales
You for the gram we weighing this shit on different scales
No picket fence I know we grew up on different streets
It woke me up, I know its way more niggas counting sheep
Bouncing checks tryna slide off the counterfeit
They hella foul
Niggas out here playing county ball
Still bounty saul
Shame they'll never win a golden globe
Some niggas only taking naps
Some niggas comotose
You get em fired you find out some niggas Omarosa

[?]
Multiple elephants in the room
Ain't nothing new
Poachers done setted in
They using sedatives too
I'm still preaching the same element
Exploring business ventures with my fellowship
Eliminated the light bulbs with no filament
You ain't in my circle if we not intimate on some level
Got dumbells on my shoulders, I folded
Drinking folgers these days, I talk the water till my clothes is moldy
[?] if came down to the wire niggas could'nthold me
They always talk the old you
Them niggas never know me
I never owe nobody nothing but Jon
Who cutting onions?
These days I'm all about cutting the line
Cutting through the bullshit my nigga its nothign to shine its nothing to stunt its nothing to rhyme
You elevating minds or you fucking the blind and ducking the smoke
Sup with the swine but wanna be goat you really just sheep
You wanna be woke you really just sleep walked in front of me
Man What are these jokes?
Rich in spirit I won' t hear it if you cunning me bro
Tried to pass these hoes the joint they didn't want any smoke
I want to be blunt when I spit out the truth
They want me to choke they want me to front
Ruffle feathers and then they want me to ghost
Crumble concentrates I'm rolling foreal
Sand trapping I won't shorten my stroke
