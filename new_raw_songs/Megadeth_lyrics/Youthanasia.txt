// Reckoning Day //

I like the way that I make you itch
And all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game
I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop
I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies, empty skies

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no payback time
It ain't no getting even
Here comes the reckoning day, day, day, day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realise you are prey for me
I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground, to the ground

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no payback time
It ain't no getting even
Here comes the reckoning

Don't want no revenge (don't want no revenge)
Ain't no payback time (ain't no payback time)
It ain't no getting even (it ain't no getting even)
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day, day, day

Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day
Oh, here it comes...
It's coming to getcha...

// Addicted To Chaos //

Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people, will I find another one?
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said "One day you'll walk alone."
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

Lights shined on my path, turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, smashed 'cause I could
My brain was laboured, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said "One day you'll walk alone."

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
Oh...

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted to chaos

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
Stand...

In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
Builds, it builds, it builds
In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
I'm addicted to the, I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

Addicted
Addicted to chaos, chaos
Addicted to chaos
Chaos, chaos

// À Tout Le Monde //

Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
When I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all

Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred

Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone that's all

[2x]
Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

// Elysian Fields //

Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgement Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh
The last best hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

Elysian fields, we are storming the heavens
Elysian fields, to raise the swords and shields
Elysian fields, we ascend to our destiny
Elysian fields, to the Elysian fields

Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones

One last look at visions of flesh
The last blessed hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

Elysian fields, we are storming the heavens
Elysian fields, to raise the swords and shields
Elysian fields, we ascend to our destiny
Elysian fields, to the Elysian fields

Elysian fields, we are storming the heavens
Elysian fields, to raise the swords and shields
Elysian fields, we ascend to our destiny
Elysian fields, to the Elysian fields

Elysian fields, we are storming the heavens
(We are storming the heavens)
Elysian fields, to raise the swords and shields
(To raise the swords and shields)
Elysian fields, we ascend to our destiny
(We ascend to our destiny)
Elysian fields, to the Elysian fields...

// The Killing Road //

Again we stalk the stage
At mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left its cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behaviour's quite insane
But we do it for the fame

I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long-lost friend, oh
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long, that's all

I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

Lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

// Blood Of Heroes //

Walking stiff, let me tell ya'
Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well, it's full speed ahead
My legions, when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late

Ladies and gents, we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket, Devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere, 'cause heroes never die

Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die

We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead-end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth

Ladies and gents, we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts, it's time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cause heroes never die

Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die

Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
They never die

Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, blood of heroes
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, blood of heroes

// Family Tree //

Forgotten things remembered
The tigers eat their young
The body stayed, but inside the head
The mind was on the run
A conspiracy of silence
The only way out of pain
Is turn around, run through it, man
Too wet to come in from the rain
Tell them
I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family

When you hear them saying "Trust me"
Don't wait to see what's next
Thrown to the wolves, forever trusting
Raised in a form of living Hell
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say
"I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me."
No, no...

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
The secret of the family tree

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
The secret of the family tree

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree...

// Youthanasia //

Who'd believe with the way things are here?
We'd be goin' anywhere telling people how to live
Who'd believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns than to educate our sons?
Sorry, but that's what they did

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information, don't need no more anything

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for youthanasia

// I Thought I Knew It All //

Somewhere there's a reason why things go like they do
Somewhere there's a reason why some things just fall through
We don't always see them for what they really are
But I know there's a reason, just can't see it from this far

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew it all, I thought I knew it all

Somewhere there's a reason why things don't go my way
Somewhere there's a reason that I cannot explain
Just like the change of seasons, just may not be my turn
But I know there's a reason, the lesson's mine to learn

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew it all, I thought I knew it all

I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew it all, I thought I knew it all

I thought I knew it all

Thought I, thought I, thought I, thought I
Thought I, thought I, thought I, thought I knew it all

// Victory //

Now, one day I started telling everyone that
"Killing Is My Business.." and I was hung like a Martyr
For "Looking Down The Cross" my "Skull Beneath The Skin"
Prophesied "Last Rites/Loved To Death" my friends
Then I started seeing "Bad Omens" in my head
"Good Mourning/Black Friday" will I "Wake Up Dead"?
If I "Ain't Superstitious" then this won't mean a Thing
But some crazy shit has happened since "The Conjuring"

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Came "Anarchy" to "Set The World Afire"
Pain of "Hook In Mouth", "In My Darkest Hour"
Corruption of the world "Peace Sells... But Nobody's Buying"
Ignorant Religion "Holy Wars" and the dying
"Tornado" nearly got me by the "Skin O' My Teeth"
"This Was My Life", "Foreclosure Of My Dreams"
May the past "Rust In Peace" In "Hangar 18"
And "Countdown To Extinction"
Just be a bad dream
"Lucretia" said...

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Not even close
Not even close
Not even close
To overdose

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

// New World Order (Demo) //

[Music & Lyrics - Mustaine / Friedman / Ellefson / Menza]

Where have the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New World Order will hold the mass

A book written by man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied
Without the mark you shall die

[Solo - Friedman]

No confession, all is known
New World Order, you shall be shown

Monitoring all wages
New World Order comes in stages
Your currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat

Symbol of society today
A must - have or you shall pay
As humans' flesh leads the mind
Just a pawn, the last martyr dies

[Solo - Friedman]

No confession, all is known
New World Order, you shall be shown

[Solo - Friedman]

[Solo - Mustaine]

Where have the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation come to pass
New World Order will hold the mass
