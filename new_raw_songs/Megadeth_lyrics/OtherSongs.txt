// Coming Home To Argentina //

And today, I leave you
But I'll be back someday
And as I fly away
My hope is that we'll meet again
I'm off to my home away from home
I will miss you
But I know
I know you know

I'm coming home to Argentina
I'm coming home...

I'll take you everywhere I go
I'll show you everything I see
And as we say so long
I know your tears wish me well
It won't be long till I'm back again
We will meet again
We will meet again
You will see, oh

I'm coming home to Argentina
I'm coming home to Argentina

// Delivering The Goods //

Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, body's aching
Looking for some action
Satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced
As active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton, Leviathan
We're ready to hit the roof

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods

Shake down, rock 'em boys
Crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves
Battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts
All across the land
Hot blood doing good
We're going to load you with our brand

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods

Have it your way
Stealing your hearts

Well, we don't pull no punches
We aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You got to learn your lesson
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart

Faster, higher
Until it seems that we're gonna break
Oh, shooting further
Giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leaving with your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods

// Kill The King //

[Dave Mustaine]

Broken down, feeling naked
Leaving me unfulfilled
Promising compromise
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the King

Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the
King,
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, The King is dead
I am the King, Long live the King
Kill the King, The King is dead
I am the King, Long live the King

I reveal a deceiver
In the highest seat in the land
His idle hands the Devil's workshop
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the King

Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the
King,
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, The King is dead
I am the King, Long live the King
Kill the King, The King is dead
I am the King, Long live the King

A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust
An explosion of the Brain, an explosion of the
Brain
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust

Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the
King,
I am the King
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live
the King,
I am the King
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live
the King,
I am the King
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live
the King,
I am the King
