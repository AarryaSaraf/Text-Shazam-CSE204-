// Trust //

Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

Time and again,
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends,
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

How could this be happening to me
I'm lying when I say "Trust me"
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering

Absolutely nothing we trust

// Almost Honest //

I lied just a little
When I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost

Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest, almost

Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks

I question your call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know

[Solo - Friedman]

Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks

Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest

// Use The Man //

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no "last goodbyes" to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies, lies, lies...
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose, oh...

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in his hand
Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
In my hand, in my hand
In my hand!

// Mastermind //

Anonymous existence, rendered useless to mankind
Destroy the logic volume in the confines of the mind
Enmassed and purposeless, marching in a perfect line
Neo-neuro torture, mental meltdown, a heinous crime

Mastermind, I tell you what to think
I tell you what you need
I tell you what to feel

Invade the core of souls to wipe the lives away
Design vacant beings, welcome the inhuman race
Encrypted horror codes, directive psyche overwrite
Processing brains to pabulum, delete and format living drives

I tell you what's real

Hail to the power age, lest the viral hour comes
Raise the flag of voltage, bow to circuitry unknown
Kneel before the processor, lords of static laugh
Electrons in submission, you must know who I am

I tell you what to think
I don't care what you thought
I tell you what to get
I don't care what you got

Subject

// The Disintegrators //

The slayer's arrived
On a black horse of steel
Trouble is coming
Hell on two wheels

Hide in the shadows
Awaiting defeat
Or live by the sword
And choose to be free

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the doors
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming
Here it comes
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

// I'll Get Even //

I'm lonely and abandoned
Washed up, left for dead
I'm lost inside the desert
Of every word you said

Like a nuclear reactor
Or TNT
I'm thinking about the times
When you lied to me

All the innuendo
Caught up on your hook
I was just a name
In your little black book

Ah, I'll get even with you

I'm bitter and I'm twisted
I haven't slept in days
I'm lonely and I'm angry
I can't make it go away

I'm like a bomb that's ticking
I got voices in my head
I got a doll with needles in
Wishing you were dead

I'll get you back somehow
That's what I'm gonna do
I'll get you back somehow
Your nightmare coming true

Ah, I'll get even with you
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna get even with you

You better look behind you
'Cause there I'm gonna be
I'll be standing in the shadows
With who I used to be

He's slightly schizophrenic
Me and me and me and me agree
That you are gonna pay
For what you did to me

Ah, I'll get even with you
Gonna get even with you
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do
Ah, I'll get even with you

// Sin //

He had an unfamiliar face
Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin

Not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch my face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Reasons, deep in me
Let me be
Let me bleed
Set me free
The reasons that we sin

// A Secret Place //

There's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside you can't get out
There's no coming back, I hear them shout

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away

Let me in, get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
In disgrace

I hide from those that try to find me
Scary things that's right behind me
I lost myself, I must confess
I can't explain how I got this mess

// Have Cool, Will Travel //

Mamas pack their lunches, kiddies back their guns
Wishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies
We the people, point our fingers, blame and wonder why

Face it and fight or turn high tail and run
'Til it comes back again just like the rising sun
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try

There's no recess and no rules in the school of life
If you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Have cool, will travel

Tell myself it ain't true, they just cannot see
Grown up or sewn up, the medicine's worse than the disease
I have cool, will travel
Here we go

// She-Wolf //

The mother of all that is evil
Her lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
The priestess roars, "Get down on your knees"

The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heart beat than my own
The sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her hidden will to kill in disguise

// Vortex //

Internal combustion
Multiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony

Curse the falling rain
The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time the price was paid

Scorching the domain
The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Written in torment
Howl our dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces
Writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory
Tumble down
Endless death
The jewels of a crown

// F.F.F //

Looking for a cure within the human race
Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take
Burning up the tents of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile

Crushing down, caving in our will to live
Getting rid of man's mistakes
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down
How much more can we take

Fight for freedom, fight authority
Fight for anything, my country tis' of me

Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve
Resist the war machine, don't get in it's path
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath

Crushing down, caving in our will to live
Getting rid of man's mistakes
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down
How much more can we take

Fight! It's my country

// Trust (Spanish Version) //

Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Presionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
(I with I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Presionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te pido de rodillas ayudame por favor
Presiondos por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que ya en nada confiamos

[whispered:]
Como pudo sucederme esto a mi?
Me muero cuando digo confia en mi
No puedo creer que esto sea verdad
La confianza duele
Por que la confianza es igual a sufrimiento
sufrimiento

[Solo - Marty]

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Presionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te pido de rodillas ayudame por favor
Presiondos por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que ya en nada confiamos

We lie to each other so much
Absolutely nothing we trust!

// Evil That's Within //

There once was a familiar face
Battle scars in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pyramids of dead men and dogs
Spoils of war so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

[Solo - Marty]

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch your face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Evil, evil
Evil, deep in me
Evil, let me be
Evil, let me bleed
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, the evil that's within

// Vortex (Alternate Version) //

Internal terrorism
Multiple personalities
Inside the screams were deafening
Outside in silent agony

Curse coming down
A maelstrom of plagues

Medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Mephistophelian transaction
A virgin soul, the price was paid

Scouring the days
The vortex of pain

A telestic message to you all
Written in torment
Howl out your dirges
Like a sonic blast

Distorted faces
Twisting in rage
Butt you head against the horns of the ram
You're tortured to appease

[Solo - Marty]

// Bullprick //

Pounding in my teeth
Hydraulics on the move
Kicking in my face
Savage bucking mule
Pummeling my soul
100 tons of lead
Trampled under foot
Steamrollers on my head
Crushing down, caving in my will to live
I'd rather be dead, scream insane
To have the bullprick split their guts
Make them pay make them bleed
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick!
Pulverizing flesh, broken bones the aftermath
Can't escape the war, the war machine path
All become one, flattening the streets
Cry for absolution, splitting at the seams
Crushing down, caving in my will to live
I'd rather be dead, scream insane
To have the bullprick split their guts
Make them pay make them bleed
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick!
On your backs, in your face
Down your throats, up your ass
Bullprick!

// One Thing //

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing makes you feel brand new
Is the one thing that you're coming to
Just the one thing
Gets you in the mood

You call my number in the middle of the night
To tell me nothing else can make you feel alright
But it rings and rings you hang it up
And call me back again

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing
That you got to choose
Is the one thing you can never lose
Just the one thing is your attitude

You call my name in the middle of the night
When your makin' love and it feels alright
But it's him not me
Can't you see a shot of reality?

I know what you do
I know what you want to do
I know when the lights go out
I know what you are gonna to do

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

Just the one thing gets you in the mood
Just the one thing its your attitude
One thing is one thing
Just the one thing
Oh
