// Kingmaker //

Generation of the dark watch their lives decay
Persecuting their 'own kind', there's nothing you can say
Don't ask anyone for help, they won't know what to do
If you try, if you don't die, you'll end up black and blue

Epidemic of addiction, worshipping the pill
Drown them all with alcohol, anything for thrills
Precious life goes up in smoke, going nowhere fast
The world is running rampant and you know that this can't last

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

Searching for an answer, but you see you're all alone
Mom and Daddy's lights are on but nobody's home
They glorify their tortured life; they talk of days like this
Sentencing their children, when they need to eat a fist

Narcotics have enslaved them; now it's coming after you
Pearls of wisdom hit the floor, there's nothing you can do
Out of control, you sell your soul, so blind, you couldn't see
Ten feet tall, it made you crawl; it's better you than me

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
It makes me feel alive, I want everything
It makes me feel alright, I want everything
The things I can't deny, I want everything
I want to be the King!

// Super Collider //

When you feel life is bringing you down
And you see that youâre all alone
When your friends they have all run out
That is when you will know Iâm the one

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
âTil the world explodes (âtil the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

This could be all the heaven youâll see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living hell
Come with me and Iâll free your soul (hooah)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
âTil the world explodes (âtil the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

Just one thing that I want you to know
You donât need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and Iâll take you home

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
âTil the world explodes (âtil the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
âTil the world explodes (âtil the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (super collider yeah)

On the high road (like a super collider)
I will take you higher (like a super collider)
âTil the world explodes (like a super collider)
Super collider!

// Burn! //

I've got a sickening feeling
My life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in
But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good

I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
Till I light it up and burn it down
One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn... like I knew it would
Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire... my desire to burn

[Solo - Dave]

I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape
The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takes

// Built For War //

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

Listen, I didn't start this - believe me, I will finish it...
You called down the thunder - too late now there's no way out...
Nothing is gonna stop me - until then better watch your back...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

There is no retreating - I will cut you down to size...
You will beg for mercy - a bad seed, you're as good as dead...
Yield to new dimension - Hell's coming, better say your prayers...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

[Solo - Chris]

One day you will face me - and see the terror trapped inside...
Final retribution - torture and pure punishment...
Vengeance running so deep - a dungeon of agony awaits...
Fear not as death surrounds you - Bitch all you want, but here it comes...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

[Solo - Chris]

// Off The Edge //

Lately, it seems the world is going crazy
It won't be long till they replace me
And nothing seems to faze me, anymore

I can't take it, I get the feeling I won't make it
I'm feeling bad and I can't shake it
And now I'm living just to fake it, what's more

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge

Lately, I wake each morning feeling beat
And now there's panic in the street
Someone keeps turning up the beat everywhere

Every day, I'm like an actor on the stage
I'll never let you see my rage
I'm not at peace out of my cage anywhere

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edge

[Solo - Dave]

[Solo - Chris]

Lately, I can't believe the things I see
This ignorance and apathy
Brings out the lunatic in me, if you care?

It blows my mind, when you sneak off into the night
Maybe it's better that you lie
Just don't forget to say goodbye, if you dare?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edge

// Dance In The Rain //

Sentenced to work a dead end 9 to 5
Trapped in a dingy corporate cubicle hell
Then go to work in the darkness on the midnight shift
Any chance you get, selling gas at the corner Shell

Three letters groups listening in on you
Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car
Drones monitor each and every move you make
It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are

You'll never see a ray of daylight
So far in debt you're struggling to survive
But you will break your back fighting and they'll help
Before you let them break your pride

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

[Solo - Dave]

Down on your luck, you had your hand out once or twice
But all you wanted was just a hand, they say
"You have the right to remain silent", so shut your mouth
Don't mention the broken promises and lies of hope and change

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

[Solo - Chris]

Never come, dance in the rain, it ain't gonna come

[Solo - Dave]

Enslave and impoverish the middle class
Make them dependent then strip it all away
Al-CIA-da, destruction, and democide
Addiction, corruption, every word's a lie

Races, classes, sexes, religious wars
Destroy the family, and what love is for

The Fed and the Bankers own all the politicians
May I introduce you to the sons of perdition?
Replace the dictators Washington appointed
The Devil Messiahs and the dangerously disappointed

They lie to themselves, pleased with what they've done
Soon they all will be repaid and there's nowhere to run

// Beginning Of Sorrow //

Beginning of Sorrow
There'll be no tomorrow
Beginning of Sorrow

Easy prey, so innocent
She barely was a teen
Hooked up with Mr. Right now
A nightmare that stole her dreams
Complications come
The Doctor says you gotta know
You decide if the baby lives
But one of you has got to go

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

Brought forth in agony
This life was misbegot
Born in an alleyway
A child nobody will adopt
Delinquent in a foster home
His heart is so full of rage
His first name's "Ward"
His last name is "Of the State"

[Solo - Dave]

[Acoustic - Chris]

Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies

[Solo - Dave]

Like father, like son
Soon he gets revenge
Two souls soon become one
The vicious cycle never ends
Unwanted, unloved
He lives now just to hate
From the pain of being born
And nothing can take that away

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow...

// The Blackest Crow //

This cold, empty house is
So quiet now she's gone
The dust accumulates into
Mountains on the ground

My paper's piled on the steps
Her flowers all have died
I'm searching everywhere
For someone I'll never find

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

[Slide - Dave]

Shadows fill this place
She's been away so long
The wallpaper leaves a stain
Where pictures once belonged

You think I would have known
Something was going on
Her kisses were so cold
Her loving touch withdrawn

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

[Solo - Dave]

They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
I know t's too late, when you've lost your soul
The fires all but gone, my world is darker now
Than the blackest crow

[Slide - Dave]

The blackest crow...

// Forget To Remember //

[Solo - Dave]

Sands in the hourglass fall for us all
You don't answer me anymore when I call
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

[Solo - Dave]

If this is living, what the hell is living for?
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face
You can't recall me at all,
there's not a trace... not a trace... not a trace
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

[Solo - Chris]

I just want to talk - What do you want?
But you've nothing to say - Leave me alone
I beg you to come - Get away from me
And you just walk away - I have no idea who you are!
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray

A burning candle in-between and at both ends
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend
I just wish you could say my name again

They made the lock and broke the key,
the culprit was the mercury
The vaccine wipes your memories,
till you forget even how to breathe
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie

You forget to remember... it's time to say the long goodbye

// Don't Turn Your Back... //

[Solo - Chris]

When things were good I know you would always be there for me
Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between
I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right
Just ain't right

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back...

[Solo - Chris]

[Solo - Dave]

When things were bad you always had something else better to do
It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you
You steal what's mine then help me look for it;
how many times do I pay for it? How many times?

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

Don't turn your back...

[Solo - Chris]

// Cold Sweat //

I put my money in the suitcase
And headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet

Cold, cold sweat

They say chances on the outside
Are looking very slim
I've been so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet

Cold, cold sweat

I've got me a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to las vegas

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win means double
And I got me a heavy bet

Cold, cold sweat

I put my money in the suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I got a whole months wages

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy
Place another bet
