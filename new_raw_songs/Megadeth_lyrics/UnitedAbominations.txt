// Sleepwalker //

[Music & Lyric Dave Mustaine]

I should be calling collect from jail
For the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed

No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life

I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes and you just vanish soon as I
Lay down my head when I'm dead to the whole wide world

No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
And then I wake up and it was all just a dream
And everything is the same

Sleepwalker - Did I give you concrete shoes?
And throw you off of a bridge
Sleepwalker - When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul's mine to keep, I feel you near me
Go to sleep, Sleepwalker

Just taking a stroll; don't go to sleep! Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!

You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll your body up in a carpet to make music in the
Trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end, is that I send you up the river like a punk

No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life

The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter, I am without fear
Now you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for you

No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
I'm calling down the thunder, then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes

Sleepwalker - Did I tell you I was in movies?
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch
Sleepwalker - Everyday, another way, I know you can hear me

[Solo - Mustaine]
[Solo - Drover]

I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear

No one is safe when I close my eyes; I come to take your life
And then I wake up and it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same

Sleepwalker - Did I give you concrete shoes?
And throw your body off of a bridge
Sleepwalker - When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me

Sleepwalker - Or did I tell you I was in movies?
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch
Sleepwalker - Everyday, another way, I know you can hear me

Sleepwalker - Did I buy you the farm?
Put a horse head in your bed
Sleepwalker - When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me

Sleepwalker - Everyday
Everyday another way
Sleepwalker - When I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I know you can hear me

[Repeat Choruses]

// Washington Is Next //

The quiet war has begun with silent weapons
And the new slavery is to keep the people
Poor and stupid, "Novus Ordo Seclorum"

How can there be any logic in biological war?
We all know this is wrong, but the New World Order's
Beating down the door, oh something needs to be done

There was a King, an evil King,
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine, the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more

The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne: Washington is Next!

Disengage their minds, sabotage their health
Promote sex and war and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers; it's their fault, "Annuit Coeptis"
Attack the church dynamic, attack the family
Keep the public undisciplined 'til nothing left is sacred and
The "have-not's" get hooked and have to go to the "have's" just to cop a fix

I am the King (an evil king),
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more

The word predicts my future and tells the truth about my past
Of how the world's leaders are waiting to usher in
The eighth world power of modern Rome: Washington is Next!

There was a King, an evil king,
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago, that that was, that is, that is no more

I am a King, and I dream the wildest dreams
Nobody could interpret
Seven empires falling, the wolf is at my door
Oh, that that was, that is, that is no more

There's something at my door, some ancient mystery
The future tells the truth about my past
And I'm the eighth false king to the throne
I've got you in my crosshairs, now, ain't that a bitch?

Washington, you're next!

// Never Walk Alone //

Hiding in then the door way
and then the shadow
any place where danger
waits to kill my time
there is one who loves and waits
to seal your fate
I'm sure as you live and die
Live and die
Live and die

When you feel that something wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

Let me wrap my arms all around you
suffer the trespasses that you made
I will drink your pain away
forever and a day
if you just call out my name
If you just call
call my name
if you just call
Even whisper it

When you feel that something wrong
Ill shelter you and keep you warm
Ill never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

SOLO!!!!!!!

When you feel that something wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

When you feel that something wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it wont be long
Time to reap what I have sewn
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy it once was me

// United Abominations //

[Music and Lyrics Dave Mustaine]

Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron, the United "Abominations" as it were.                                                        Born to prevent wars, it froze in the face of disaster and stood silent while terrorization to hostage of the world
In a mire of hypocrisy, the U.N. ignores sex crimes by its "blue helmets", and enables terrorism; so in the end it's failed and the U.N. is where our
so-called friends get to stab us in the back and we pay 22% of their tab to host our
enemies here at home.

Ambassadors from countries enjoy otherwise known as a catastrophe, enjoy Diplomatic immunity living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes It's a complete and utter disgrace, a blot on the face of humanity, and they get away with it.

Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Kojo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint,
They will lose the U.N. one way or another
The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations

A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack
Based on secret intelligence it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq, Iran, and Korea
You may bury the bodies

But you can't bury the crimes only
Fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me, not when Death lasts forever

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations

"The U.N. writes resolution after resolution and has become irrelevant through inaction and totalitarian paralysis,"
"Order, Order!!!"
"Ha! There is no such thing as order"
"Larry, it's true, reports confirm today that the United Nations has officially closed its doors forever,"
"Well, I just don't see what all the fuss is, because they don't do anything anyway, do they?"

The U.N. is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations

NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no U.N.
The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no U.N.
Saddam Hussein violated 17 U.N. resolutions; The U.N. was asked to join the
war in Iraq. The U.S. invaded, Ha! there was no U.N.
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no U.N.
Iran funds Hamas, and attacked the U.S. in the
seventies, there was no stinking U.N.
Facing War without end, looking into the future, there was no more U.N.

// Gears Of War //

Ethnic cleansing with no defending
These acts of genocide
A fatal ending with no surrendering
To cover up the crimes and lie

Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War
Hoo-rah!!!

If you ride with thieves, then you die with thieves
Cross my heart and hope that you die, that you die!
When the smoke has cleared, the devil's in the mirror
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die!

Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War
Hoo-rah!!!

// Blessed Are The Dead //

A great sign appeared
Under the stars and the moon
Sounds of galloping horses
On clouds of lightning and thunder

A dark gathering storm
To scorch the earth for many generations
A nuclear winter
Worse than any cold or holy war

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The doctrine of hatred
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come

I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the dead

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The synagogue of Satan
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the dead

// Play For Blood //

Anybody searching for action
Anything to fill the emptiness inside
Any place that the streets are empty
Any takers wanna pour out their lives
With fire and lightning shooting from my hand
And desolation written across my eyes
My itchy finger on the hairpin trigger
My tempers hot and my patience's taken flight

Inside the abattoir
The cover charge is somebody's gotta die
Now, I hear you screaming out for mercy
Last man that's standing wins the fight
Too late, I see your end zero in on you
Even mortal enemies, they can't deny
Let me help you up again
The wings of god surround me
I live to play because I know I'll never die

If I win again, I'm still the champion
And if you win, ha, that's just impossible
I don't play for keeps; I don't play for your soul
I don't play to win; I don't play for it all
I play for blood

I don't play for keeps, I play for blood
I don't play for your soul, I play for blood
I don't play to win, I play for blood
I don't play for it all, I play for blood
I play for blood

// A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free) //

Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
When I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all

Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred

Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone that's all

Ã tout le monde [To all the world]
Ã tout mes amis [To all my friends]
Je vous aime [I love you]
Je dois partir [I have to leave]
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
[2x]

These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

// Amerikhastan //

Recruiting the ill-fated for "The War"
A legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA, God help them

[Solo - Drover]
[Solo - Mustaine]

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God;the undoing of man

Promising a vapor, in the end they become one

[Solo - Drover]

No rules of engagement, this enemy hides
Amongst women and children

And to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC, CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is "property of The USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton"
Surprise?!
But a roaring lion is about to be on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe? Guess what? We're coming to get you!

[Solo - Drover]
[Solo - Mustaine]

All that you envisioned of what things will come to be
Turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God, the undoing of man

[Solo - Drover]

// You're Dead //

When someone becomes nothing to anyone
Wilts feelings have died
Anyone would know it
They set out stick and stones
They say they crossed my bones
I say I donât get mad I get even
before they do.

Spoils go to the victor
Iâm dead on time
Your time is going to come

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me

Weâre all just trying to hold on to anything
Youâd think theyâd know thatâs what weâre trying to do
These wounds are invisible

Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
But then when things got bad we spread our wings and fly away

Youâll take all your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me

One day Iâll dance on your grave
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge

One day Iâll dance on your graves
Even if youâre buried at sea
Till then till when I exact my revenge
Iâll tell them youâre dead to me

// Burnt Ice //

[Solo - Mustaine]

He said he'd try just a little bit

[Solo - Mustaine]

He didn't want to end up like them

[Solo - Drover]

And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder

[Solo - Mustaine]

Pounding on the door to make the next score

[Solo - Drover]

Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul

Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies
His cause of death... high speed on burnt ice

[Solo - Mustaine]

Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man
Memories of his family are calling after him
He can hardly think, hardly walk
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk
With just one hit the pain would go away
But he's dead if he does

[Solo - Drover]
[Solo - Mustaine]
[Solo - Drover]

Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows

[Solo - Mustaine]

// Out On The Tiles //

As I walk down the highway, all I do is sing this song
And a train that's passing my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words, they're clear
The voice is strong, it's oh-so strong

I am just a simple guy, I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away
There's nothing more that I can say, but on a day like today
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love

I'm so glad I'm living, gonna tell the world that I am
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man
One thing that I know for sure, gonna give her all the loving like nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun, trying to flag a ride
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace that they set the pace, it must be a race
And the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
All I need from you, is all your love
All you gotta give to me, is all your love
