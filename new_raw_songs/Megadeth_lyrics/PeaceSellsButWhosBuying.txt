// Wake Up Dead //

I sneak in my own house,
It's four in the morning,
I had too much to drink,
Said I was out with the boys,
I creep in my bedroom,
I slip into bed,
I know if I wake her,
I'll wake up dead,

[Chorus:]
I wonder, will she find out,
About the other, other lover,
Diana.

Wake up dead, you die,
Wake up dead, and buried,
Wake up dead, you die,
Wake up dead.

// The Conjuring //

Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematise
All of those who oppose us
Don't summon the devil
Don't call the priest
If you need the strength
The conjuring. Obey!!!

Behold the flames rise
From the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil
And, with the ashes you'll annoint

Arrange the symbols
Of the wizard, and, magician
Light the candles
Place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place
The lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom
Fold, and, burn, and, centralise

Don't summon the devil
Don't call the priest
If you need the strength
Then conjure me

I am the devil's advocate
A salesman, if you will
You know my name. (You know my name)

I met your father years ago
Gave him what he'd please
He called my name, you'll do the same

I'm claiming what is mine by right
It's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold, bought and sold

Come join me in my infernal depths
Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul, I've got your soul
The conjuring. Obey!!!

// Peace Sells //

What do you mean I "don't believe in God?"
I talk to him every day
What do you mean I "don't support your system?"
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean I "can't get to work on time?"
Got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean I "don't pay my bills?"
Why, do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What do you mean I "hurt your feelings?"
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I "ain't kind?"
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean I "couldn't be the president
Of the United States of America?"
Tell me something
It's still "we the people," right?

If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

Can you put a price on peace?

Peace, peace sells
Peace, peace sells!

Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?

Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?
Peace sells, but who's buyin'?

No, no-no-no-no
Peace sells
(Peace sells)
Peace sells!

// Devil's Island //

The light that fills my lonely cell,
Is blocked out by the key,
That locks the door to this hell,
The place they wanted me.
Time's racing like the wind,
Execution's near,
Oh lord, I wait for death,
And, yes, I have no fear.
I recall that night, my every breath,
And, step along the way.
Closed my eyes, walking,
As danger paved the way.
The devil, and the darkness
Let her evil wander free
And, here on Devils Island,
The final stop for me.

[Chorus:]
Devils Island, Devils Island.

Oh, there is no escape,
The sea is full of sharks.
The tide takes you away, and
Smashes you on the rocks.
The sun is shining,
But feel not today,
It's warmth, it's dying,
And fading away.

[Chorus (repeat):]
Devils Island, (here I stay) Devils Island.

Oh, hear the call,
From the grave beyond.
Oh, so pernicious,
Her soul it creates song.
As there is no man, that is
Here upon the earth,
Able to terminate our
Noisome will since birth.

The priest that reads the sermons,
Is walking next to me,
To the stake, my last request,
To have her burn with me.
But, so it did, the heavens opened,
Rain began to fall.
The final judgement came, and
Was spread before you all.
Final judgement.

Old, weak, and feeble,
But the lesson taught to me,
To stay away from evil,
She doesn't care for me.
She haunts me in my sleep,
Though I tore that page away.
And, here on Devils Island,
I'll always have to stay.

[Chorus (repeat):]
Devils Island, Devils Island.
(Devils Island, Devils Island.)
Here I am.

[Chorus (repeat 4 times):]
Devils Island, Devils Island.

// Good Mourning / Black Friday //

[Part 1: Good Mourning]

Good mourning

Hey, I don't feel so good
Something's not right
Something's coming over me
What the fuck is this?
Whoa!

[Part 2: Black Friday]

Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughter's my evil deed

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head
Yeah!

Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces, 'til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend
Bloodbath's my way of gettin' clean

I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you, and I'm waiting for Black Friday

Turn me loose!
Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughter's my evil deed
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down

It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the
Devil on the, Devil on the wall

// Bad Omen //

Down fell the stars as they splashed into the sea
"Mi nomine Baphomet", come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites
Their master's time has come, the moon is full tonight

Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast
The Devil, who's watching with demon's remote
Fire rising, racing in your blood
Possessed, naÃ¯ve, his service done

It's the Sabbath, bloody Sabbath
Bad omen of the goat
Bloody blasphemy

Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill
An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes
The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings but down comes the worst
Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless and no one can save

No one can save
No one can save
No one can save
No one can save, one can know
No one can save, one can know

// I Ain't Superstitious //

Well I ain't superstitious
When a black cat crosses my path
And I ain't superstitious
As I break the looking glass
Ain't afraid of no demons
Don't make me laugh, ha-ha
But I ain't superstitious
Under the ladder I go
And I ain't superstitious
It's all bullshit, don't you know?
Ain't afraid of no shadows
I like the dark anyway
And that's a fact
Ha!

Superstitious
Superstitious

And I ain't superstitious
No such thing as bad luck
And I ain't superstitious
I couldn't really give a fuck
Take your stupid superstitions
Find some other paranoidal, chickenshit
Sissy, worm and tell it to him

Superstitious
Superstitious

I ain't superstitious

I ain't superstitious

That's right, one more time
Come on, shut your mouth
Listen up
Hey, it's my turn

// My Last Words //

My life's on time, but again my sense is late
Feel a might unsteady, but still I have to play
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes
Once again I gamble with my very life today
Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger, never trouble 'til you're squeezed
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease

Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet, the second round begins
A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said

A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill
A fraction of a second, do you lose, or maybe still?
Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill
Add another bullet, the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
Please, no IOUs, no markers for death
Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play?

You, you, next victim
You, next to die
You, you, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You... die!
