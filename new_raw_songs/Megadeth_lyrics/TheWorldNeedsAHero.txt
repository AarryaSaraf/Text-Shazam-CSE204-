// Disconnect //

[Dave Mustaine]

Behind closed doors all you live for is taking
That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking
Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter
Don't you hear people talking? What is it that your after?

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect

The key to save yourself if for nothing else
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden
With a broken heart underneath all of the pain
Do you stroke the pretty scars? The hurt never ends

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect

[Solo - Mustaine]

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's so real so you just - Disconnect

[End Chorus Solos - Pitrelli / Percussion - Chris Vrenna]

// The World Needs A Hero //

[Dave Mustaine]

An Iron fist quietly sits inside the Velvet Glove
Take control, untouchable just like God above
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?
If I object, then I defect my country 'tis of thee

The White House is calling
Tell them I'll call them back
Just tell them anything
Yeah get them off my back

The world needs a hero

Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice
Words I say heard today are not mine, just my voice

NATO is on line 1
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I'm not in
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero

Phantom rule, the hidden jewel who's really in control?
On puppet strings, a nation swings undermined by moles

The UN is on hold
Tell them I'll call them back
Yeah tell them anything
Just get them off my back

The world needs a hero

[Solo - Mustaine]

[Solo - Pitrelli]

Dave the White House is calling
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I can't be bought
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero

[End Solos - Pitrelli]

// Moto Psycho //

[Dave Mustaine]

Responsibility, an anchor around my neck
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

[Solo - Pitrelli]

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

[Solo - Mustaine]

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho - time and time and time again I'm a
Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

// 1000 Times Goodbye //

[Dave Mustaine]

The tides of change pulled us apart
I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

[Solo - Pitrelli]

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever, but it's over

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself now it's time to break up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

[Solo - Pitrelli]

Don't call me anymore. It's just not.
I don't feel the same way about you
Its not as good as it used to be

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo - Mustaine]

I'll always love you but just not like that
Like what?
I want to be honest with you I met someone else
You did what?
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you that
I was going out of town for business?
Well I went to see him
You know what? You suck!

[Solo - Mustaine]

Goodbye 1000 times
You'll always have a special place
In my heart you know that
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over
Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times
You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brother

// Burning Bridges //

[Dave Mustaine]

You give up on yourself
Somehow you got betrayed agin
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

[Solo - Mustaine]

[Solo - Pitrelli]

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

// Promises //

[Dave Mustaine / Al Pitrelli]

Two hearts that shouldn't
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

[Solo - Pitrelli / Solo - Mustaine]

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

// Recipe For Hate... Warhorse //

[Dave Mustaine]

Each day my shortcomings pick my pockets
My faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone

[Fill solos - Mustaine]

In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero my opinion
And room temperature IQ

I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear watch it twist
My measly brain mad

[Solo - Pitrelli]

Talk about me when my bac is turned
Next time we meet it will be to late
The memory burned in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it

[Fill solos - Mustaine]

Dark clouds on the horizon
Make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake but every time
I run away, I just come back for more

The choice is clear I can quit
And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

[Solo - Pitrelli]

...Warhorse
I'm feeling quite invisible
I feel just like thin air
That nobody wants me

[Solo - Mustaine]

I see the earth below me
I watch it spinning there
Does someone, somewhere
Out there hear me?

[Solo - Pitrelli]

Sentenced to walk in Purgatory
My life is running down
I can't believe what they've done to me

[Solo - Mustaine]

I'm left riding a Warhorse
A man without a country

[Solos - Mustaine, Pitrelli, Mustaine, Pitrelli]

// Losing My Senses //

[Dave Mustaine]

One man speaking the truth
No one likes when it fits
So we tell soothing lies
And betray our own lips

The uncivilized world
And its people decay
Once sweet breeze is defiled
Sucking our breath away

[Fill Solos - Mustaine]

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards.
I'm losing my senses, I'm losing my senses

[Fill Solos - Mustaine]

We watch as the living all die
Contemplating if we should
Ever open our eyes

If all that we touch
Keeps turning to sand
We will cease to exist
Till the last living man

[Fill Solos - Mustaine]

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forward.
Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forward.
I'm losing my senses

[Fill Solos - Mustaine / Solo - Pitrelli]

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards.
Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards.

// Dread And The Fugitive Mind //

[Dave Mustaine]

Let me introduce myself I'm a social disease
I've come for your wealth leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry, I got here on my own
I won't ask for mercy, I choose to walk alone

What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers

What if I do get caught? What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences
Are Dread and the Fugitive Mind

You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you
Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find what you really left behind
You don't know when the end is but it's coming fast

What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand better count your fingers

What if I do get caught? What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences
Are Dread and the Fugitive Mind

[Solos - Mustaine, Pitrelli]

// Return To Hangar //

[Dave Mustaine]

Welcome to an empty fortress
A mighty wreck that once was proud
Ate alive by oxidation
Abandoned by a crew of cowards
Navigation systems failed
Computers crashed and they all fall down

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much

[Solo - Pitrelli]

All the guilty paid the price
Suspended by their broken necks
No one survived to tell the story
When foreign life forms resurrect
And military intelligence is
Still two words that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much

[Solos - Pitrelli, Mustaine]

[Solos - Pitrelli, Mustaine, Pitrelli, Mustaine]

// When //

[Dave Mustaine]

No hears a word I say
And my prayers are never answered
But you'll never see the pain inside of me
Stabbing me over and over and over
I trusted you and I loved you
And you spit back in my face
How could you do this to me?
When will you stop trying to hurt me?
I've walked a minefield for you
A career in hell with you
I have made it through the things
Others would surely die just watching
And the oath I take on this day
Is to know that you will be repaid
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl
Until then, until I see your world implode
I wish you death and suffering
Misery to spare
Time to release your pain
Face the last enemy
I am the last thing you will know
The last thing you will see
I see your death surrounding me
I know you, yes I do
I know you

[Fill Solos - Mustaine]

When no words are spoken and please are ignored
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?

It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life

When judgement has failed you
When your own heart's impaled you
Your wandering mind has destroyed you
Will you ever know when?

When you give everything and the feeling is gone
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?
When you take everything and you stay too long
When there's nothing left, did you take enough?

It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life

When judgement has failed you
When your own heart's impaled you
Your wandering mind has destroyed you
Will you ever know when?

[Solo - Mustaine]

// Coming Home //

And today, I leave you
But I'll be back someday
And as I fly away
My hope is that we'll meet again
I'm off to my home away from home
I will miss you
But I know
I know you know

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home to Arizona

I'll take you everywhere I go
I'll show you everything I see
And as we say so long
I know your tears wish me well
It won't be long till I'm back again
We will meet again
We will meet again
You will see, oh

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home
