Album: FallingFasterThanYouCanRun

// Still Trying //

When I wake up in the morning, I'm gonna tell
I was standing looking backwards in the outs
You said there's room enough to cramping in the crowd
No movement here no friends to break us out
Stop breathing or we'll just swim fast

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

In these moments I forget to tell myself
And if you're rolling in it long enough, your shit won't even smell
Is there no one I can trust to point it out
Well I can hardly be right here, I was spitting on myself
When I wake up in the morning I'm gonna tell

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

This wound is gonna cancel me out [x4]

Ooh ooh I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know a goddamn thing

// I Am //

We built fires large enough that it burned the woods.
Remember the sparks that caught the wind and torched the field.
We stomped at the grass in the cracks and the crust to no avail.
And I'll get burned if the wind takes more than it should.
And hey, it's a crazy life.

I got a mark, a stain from pitch and it don't wash out.
And you never know what's buried there unless you dig around.
When we get back we can clean it up and show it off.
I got plenty of bones been chipped from falling down.
And hey, what a crazy life.
And hey, what a crazy life.

I Am.
I Am.
I Am.
I Am.
I Am.

// Don't Get Too Close //

We been round, all angry and crying
Well its how much can you yell
And hey, then, while I've been outside
Well I stand and I wait and bend
Well I am never in
Well you get filled in when they sold
It took two to be right

They say we don't come any closer
It was something I want you to see
Yeah we don't come any closer
When you're weak a ya bend at the knees

They sent me out for all I could tell
They wont be there oooh aaa-at the hill
When you want me it could not have been boy
What ya want what ya cannot pretend for
They said oh I'll let em bend at a crawl around
They got my heart, they settled down
Must be the dawn, cus they barking now

They say we don't come any closer
It was something ya couldn't see
Yeah we don't come any closer
When your weak boy ya bend at the knees

Well I got pain, and I'm gonna salt it now
And with ma mouth, I've got so much I could send or 
Even fall out and then pretend
You get lonely and I gave in

They say we don't come any closer
Yeah we don't come any closer
When you're weak boy ya bend at the knees

// Laborman //

It's getting bright man,
squinting staring at the sun.
Just look at your burned skin
and try to tell me that I'm wrong.
Your laboring promise,
was anything but heavy work.
Is this all you've done then?
It took hours just to find the words.

Well, give me some time
I've been mulling around
and kicking it's teeth in the dirt.
I've got a feeling,
a sleeping depression,
that somebody's gonna get hurt.

Well, oh ya.
Well, they won't even mind.

This great succession
is a wound that never wants to heal.
Begging your pardon,
if I kinda like the way it feels.

You'll have to choke down,
the dust of me left in your mouth.
You got the harness,
so where you gonna drag me now?

Well, give me some time,
I've been mulling it around
and kicking it's teeth in the dirt.
And, I think it's pulling right for the bruisin'
and somebody's gonna get hurt.
Well, they won't
have to suffer me no more.

// How To Win //

Wait.
We're going to win
It's about time we did
And I can't decide at all if we're good
And sure, I've been
You got a face that's hard to forget.

Aw,
I'm gonna get back to you
And oh, I know
It's hard to notice every small movement and slipping through the cracks.
And, well, it's what no one ever sees,
but it's got hard-working knees.
Well, calm me down.
I gets so rough.
I'm wallowing for months at a time.
I got no presence.
Here, I've got warm loneliness.
The heart just won't quit.

// Nothing To Show For //

One single out of ten
Seen better odds in them
But it's not that bad

Well me
I was digging with my crutch
I stand in my own rut
That I wrote down

While you
You just sit and stare
It's not pealing it's a tear
And it's distance and it's where
It's getting under my skin

But a wave
Could carry you away
Or leave you somewhere else
Or leave you in the flames
So let the dirges ring
I'll be there to burn with you

We're all broke down
We're all well hid
We're all just kids
Despite our age

Look
You see this broken hand
Oh it's just another limb
Well not to me

And you
Don't listen you just talk
Well leave me in the dark
I don't wanna know

Now a wave
Could carry you away
Or leave you somewhere else
Or leave you in the flames
So let the dirges ring
I'll be there to burn with you

They don't call my name anymore
They don't wrap themselves in a song in the night
They don't call us all that we are
After all, we got nothing to show for
After all, we got nothing to show for
After all, we got nothing to show for

// Right On //

When you get tired of the wings that carry you nowhere
You stretch out your arms to see if the wind will blow you over
It seems like it's tightening, the line in the crease of your shoulder
But never in after gift of the ground
Remember the good work you done
Remember there's always some feeling, when you try to sing like
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

Say you come with me
Tell me tomorrow
Softer in their eyes
Sleep in the arrow
Say that you're with me
And we leave tomorrow
And sleep throught the daylight
Leave all the sorrow
It stands, to wave us and more
I am, am older right on
I march all over
This space, has a name, that you can't, put fame, to at all
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

It seems like the timing are complete in the mist of the measure
And the wind did'n smile then wave than forever
Well I know it's right cause
The pitch, and the purch on the lips and it love so smooth
You'll have to try and guess where it landed
I'm made be the march all over
And made be ruler all over
We're all together, right on, right on
Do do do da daaaa do daa
Do do do da daaaa do daa

Say you come with me
Tell me tomorrow
Softer in their eyes
Sleep in the arrow
Say that you're with me
We leave tomorrow
Sleep throught the daylight
Leave all the sorrow
Mhm mhmh mhmhmh
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do
Do do doooo do doo do do

// Three Fingers In //

Well It would take a mountain of men to move me
And that'd be a long way from the way that you spoke
In your head so clearly without break or breath
Or words redefining

I was stuck on my pride
And the skin
And the sinking it in

And you told me
"wipe your brow, clean me off
Give me time to figure it out."

Some songs we could sing, and never mean it
Some songs leave a ring
And you hate the few who were bold
Some burn up the sleeve
And drive too far to remember

Well I wasn't lost, I was here
I was three fingers in
I was the junkyard, and the bumper
For the few feeling left

I was the cold nail, and the ice
On the sheets of the trenched and the soaking wet

Well it'd be the bit and the reins
That broke all the teeth in the mouth

And it'd be the whip, on the foreskin
For the few that had some left
To spare

Some songs we could sing, and never mean it
Some songs leave a ring
And you hate the few who were bold
Some burn up the sleeve
And drive too far to remember

// Forgetting Is Believing //

Been there always
Could be there again
Bended all ways

To Bend it back again

It's a truce
Standing toe to toe
Yeah bold
To throw in the first blow
To leave a couple teeth to spit out

We swam out away
I hope we don't start to cramp
At least it's not a raise
Can always float on our backs

Well Its true
Its true in what they say
It's a hoax
And you don't even know
You just laugh
Laugh and when you don't
You just stare
And it's not even there
Its a joke
And it's always a big deal

To people it don't matter at all
They call in all the folks that you know
And their voice is always so very small

If we lend our gaze
Its light can not come back
So hold your breath Babe
There's always one more left
We set a good pace
Its a kind of sort of thing that always wins
And when we finally cross the line
We're dragging behind
Your stroke will be the least that defines
There is always a distance between a shout and a whistle
Between a shout and a whistle
Between a shout and a whistle

// When Do You See //

Come in and see, I got a long list of things
Remember, I can't read, we'll have to go through them slowly
And in this freeze you'd be lucky to make it a mile
So let me see and find us something warm to wear

All I got is pages we can burn to warm ourselves
I kind of get discouraged from crawling on my hands

If it feels alright, maybe come over here
I've been in a fight and I've got some wounds that you can attend
I own my days just as much as I own my nights
In my poor face, it's so swollen I'm losing sight
I don't want to brag, but we made it out alive

Babe when I come home, well tell me you want me
See you've been alone and it feels like forever
When you're not there to hold, I just feel empty

I don't know about friends, it's just hard up sometimes
Forget your sins, we're all prone to fall in flames
And even if you fall, when do you see?
Even if you fall, when do you see?

Well, tell me when do you see?
Well, tell me when do you see?

// Falling Faster Than You Can Run //

I'm on the run
Aimming too low
Breaking away
On the feet of you all
And catchin the stone
With a side of my head

Hold me back
Walking it home
I'm taking the tracks
So leave me alone
You can see me fall
Faster than
You can run

Take it away
If you're feeling it's wrong
Kicking it back
Watch it dissolve
Tug on the line
Chained to the wall
I heard you call
We're not gonna make it at

Running
Will do you no good
I'm gonna fall
I probably should
Well catch me
You never could
I planned out the distance
From where you stood

When I hit the ground
Gonna laugh out loud
Gonna lay there a while
And stare at the clouds

Baby it looks bad
Or maybe from the angle I'm at
Well I tear off my shirt
And wrap it around
Your wound
