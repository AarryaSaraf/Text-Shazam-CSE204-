// Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain //

In the twilight glow, I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages, I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

// Don't Care Darlin' //

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care. darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

I said hold on tight to me
Darlin', as we spin around
It's hard to see one's feet
And the direction in where they're bound

So baby, hold my hand
Better to move than stand
Sometimes you only have right now

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

I can't even hide it
Are you judging by the weight of the wind?
Pulled from every side but
Tonight we'll be something that we've never been

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Now somewhere at the center of me
And somewhere at the heart of you
I know I want to be saved
You said you wanted to
So come on home with me
And the rest of us be
Just the softness upon your skin

Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Let's hold a little while then
Let go of the pain and all the fear
Touch me when you are smiling
Sun will be rising and all will be clear

I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Oh, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

No, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Oh, I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

Oh, l I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright
Well I don't care, darlin'
'Cause tonight we're gonna be alright

// Famous Blue Raincoat //

It's four in the morning, the end of december
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake

She sends her regards
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

// It's Not Supposed To Be That Way //

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to control you

Like the other little children
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin'
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you

And it's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

And when you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies 'til they're gone
And then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire 'til the dawn

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
Oh, I can't be there to console you

And when you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies 'til they're gone
And then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire 'til the dawn

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know that I love you
It don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

// Low Dog Blues //

Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I wish I had a darlin' to tell my troubles to
Worried 'bout tomorrow, today's like yesterday
I've got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

I had my share of troubles, never laid my burdens down
Lonesome always follows me like a shadow on the ground
An ocean full of misery is just a drop to me
I've got nothin' to do and I've got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Old hound dog chained in the backyard and he wishes he was free
But he's got food and water, he's better off than me
I don't worry about money, money don't worry about me
I've got nothin' to do and I've got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

Lonesome low dog blues, holes in both my shoes
I wish I had a darlin' to tell my troubles to
Worried 'bout tomorrow, today's like yesterday
I've got nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues
Nothin' to do and I got nothin' to lose
But these lonesome low dog blues

// Pretty Good //

Well I got a friend in Freemont
Sells used cars, you know
Well he called me up
Twice a year
Just to ask me how it go
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same
I met a girl from Venus
Her insides are lined in gold
Well she did what she did
Asked how is the kid?

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
This boy's ever seen

Mommy went to Arkansas
She got raped by [?]
Well she was doing good until she
Went in the woods and got pinned up against the log

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
All those dogs are about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
This boy's ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddha
Singing it to save his feast
And up in the sky
An Arabian rabbi
Made Quaker oats to a priest

Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
All them gods are about the same
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
Cause actually
Everything is just about the same

// Redemption //

In the hours that I've known
And of all of my woes
Are the cause to lay you low
I demand they turn to whole

Would you set me free
Just set me free

As it takes its hold
And it won't let you go
I'm reminded of the cold
And how it's taken so much from me
Are you worthy of being saved?
All your fears and insecurities

Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free

And there's nowhere to hide
And you're only just trying
Are there only just lies you hear?
While redemption seems far away
While I stumble through every day

Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free
Just set me free

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free
Keep running till we learn to find peace

Just set me free

// Sam Stone //

Sam Stone came home
To his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas
And the time that he served
Had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in his knee
But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime
And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearin' other people's clothes

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air
But life had lost its fun
And there was nothing to be done
But trade his house that he bought on the G.I. Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...

// Summer's End //

Summer's end's around the bend just flyin'
The swimmin' suits are on the line just dryin'
I'll meet you there for our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation

Well, you never know how far from home you're feelin'
Until you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'
Well, I don't know, but I can see it snowin'
In your car the windows are wide open

Come on home
Come on home
You don't have to
Be alone
Come on home

Valentines break hearts and minds at random
That ol' Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well, I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to
Be alone
Just come on home

The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that ol' house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to
Be alone
Just come on home
Come on home
You don't have to
Be alone
Just come on home

// There Is A War //

There is a war between the rich and poor
A war between the man and the woman
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war
And the ones who say there isn't
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it
Why don't you come on back to the war, it's just the beginning

Well I live here with a woman and a child
The situation makes me kind of nervous
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love"
I call it service

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist
Why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous

You cannot stand what I've become
You much prefer the gentleman I was before
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control
I didn't even know there was a war

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed
Why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married

There is a war between the rich and poor
A war between the man and the woman
There is a war between the left and right
A war between the black and white
A war between the odd and the even

Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even
Why don't you come on back to the war

(Come on back to the war)
(Come on back to the war)
(Come on back to the war)

Can't you hear me speaking?

// This //

This heart singing out to me sings alone
This world and empty room and it's falling into line
They say just one will pass and one will leave no mark or burn

This heart is singing on and on again
This heart a wielding hammer ready to pound
This world already defined
Maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't even know

This wheelless motion will not define me
This softly singing madness is singing out aloud
This awful and unholy awful man

Inside your empty hand
And it's eating out the worm
It's odd and it's hard to hail
Or maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't know

This eye-line wandering ragged doll
This one leg pony pulling out the plow
This wondering what will be my own
And if nothing else I'll seek to find

That hairy old delight
A naive dark night
This heart is singing to you
Singing I was
This all a weight on me
Maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't even know

// Willie's Birthday Song //

Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

It was 75 the time of the preacher
When the red headed stranger appeared
Rode into town blue eyes a shining
And his memories measure in tears

Hey Nashville, Hey Austin
He's singing the songs we hold dear
Now for all of these years

So pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Now shotgun Willie wades through whiskey rivers
Living in the promise land
His heroes are cowboys and the songs there a singing
Bring joy and laughter again

Hey Georgia, New Orleans
This songs for your native son and all that he's done

So pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

// You Asked Me To //

Long ago and far away
In my old common labor shoes
I turned the world all which a way
Just because you asked me to

Likened to no other feel
Simple love is simple, true
There's no end to what I'd do
Just because you asked me to

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you asked me to

Knowin' how much I love you
And after all that I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
Just because you asked me to
Lord, I hope you never do

Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you asked me to
