Album: WhatIfI

// Buy My Round //

Do, do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do

When you wake and find the morning
Do you even know your name
I saw you took a break from living
And now I am feeling just the same

Do, do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do

Can I get with you tomorrow
In the sunlight of the day
And tell each other all we wanted
Until there is nothing left to say

We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
We're gonna skip this town, this town, this town
Buy my round, my round, my round on me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was to see you

It's been years since we were young, dear
I'm aware of where I stand
When all the time we had is dust in the wind
If I had the opportunity to tell you what you mean to me
And all that I can say is... I am

Do, do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do

We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
We're gonna skip this town, this town, this town
Buy my round, my round, my round on me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was to see you

We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
'Cause you're welcomed back again
We're gonna get it right, get it right for you and me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was
When all I really wanted was to see you

// What If I (Cook Brothers Version) //

What if I can never discover?
What if I'm just taking too long?
Or I'm wrong, my vision is cluttered, I'm stumbling on
What if I just quit tomorrow?
What if I just tuck and run?
If there ain't no line to follow, well, how will you know?

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of lettin' it show
And of all this piled together, the least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half of the cards are shown
Ah, maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow

What if I can't take the heartache?
What if I don't want to know?
What if all I found was darkness leading to none?
Well, come on, just leave the light on
Give me air and clear the room
'Cause if I don't find an answer, I fear I will fold

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of lettin' it show
And of all these piled together, the least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Ah, maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half of the cards are shown
Ah, maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
