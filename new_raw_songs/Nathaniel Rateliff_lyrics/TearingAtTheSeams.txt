Album: TearingAtTheSeams

// Shoe Boot //

Said you can't find no water
Said you can't find your feet
Maybe it's turned the corner or maybe it's not for me
If you had a lover would you bring them back to me
I can't find you honey, but I want you to dance with me

Meet me by the corner, I know a place to go
Maybe we'll love each other
Maybe I don't know

Meet me by the corner, I know a place to go
Maybe we'll love each other
Maybe I don't know

// Be There //

You start looking mean you need something to ruin
Carved out your name, not enough for you
I remember when there was nothing to take your mind off it
I know all the ways to act like a fool
I needed you

In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me

You think that you can, I take up so much room
It's the best I can bend to try and make some space for two
It spins around us in a direction to come unwind
While I needed you it was never a choice of mine

In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me

Ain't it hard enough for me to ask
It takes all of me

In other words, in other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, other ways
I want you to be there for me
In other words, in other ways
I want you to be there for me

// A Little Honey //

I need you baby, more than you'll ever, ever know
What keeps you waiting let's take our time just moving slow

I'm so lonely feeling heavy love
You're just so far from where I want you now
I need you

Come on now baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now baby, you think that I don't now
I need some honey
Come on now baby and

What if I told you, that there's a fight on every corner
They'll keep you wavering until you've reached some modern low
It's not just lazy, there's just some things you're never told

It can't always be this heavy love
We'll have to wear our fears so everyone
Can see it too

Come on now baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now baby, you think that I don't now
I need some honey
Come on now baby and

// Say It Louder //

One of these days I'm gonna take mine back
I fell forever just to watch the slack
All of the days of working in the sun
My hands remind me of every hole I dug

I said, hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
You'll climb out when you're finding your own way

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Sometimes what you need is exactly what you fear

One of these days I'll take it on my way
One of these nights I'll leave it somewhere baby
Talk of days and nights and what you want
You say forever there's way too long

Hey, hey baby
The nights turned to dawn and we're standing
In the shadows baby where we turn to face the sun

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear

Hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
You'll climb out when you finding your own way

Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Say it louder, say it clear
Sometimes what you need is exactly what you fear

// Hey Mama //

Hey mama, why it's me
Say you better wait child
Said you've been a long time running
Saving a long time money

Hey mama, answer me
Baby boy you better sit down
Can't listen when the suns out
My only son, this'll be so hard to hear

C'mon mama, what do you mean
I know you've been knocked down
I know it ain't all been easy
Nothing ever good really is

Why you gotta wait so long
Why you gotta wait so long

But she said son let me reason with you
You think you carry such a weight
I know I never beat you boy
Better start acting like this here's a race

You ain't gone far enough to say
At least I tried
You ain't worked hard enough to say
Well I've done mine
You ain't run far enough to say
My legs have failed
You ain't gone far enough
You ain't worked hard enough
You ain't run far enough to say
It ain't gonna get any better

You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me

You ain't gone far enough to say
At least I tried
You ain't worked hard enough to say
Well I've done mine
You ain't run far enough to say
My legs have failed
You ain't gone far enough
You ain't worked hard enough
You ain't run far enough to say
It ain't gonna get any better

// Babe I Know //

Babe I know it swirls around me
Like the sun shines on the coast
Like a weathered torn once sturdy barn
I used to give you shelter and warmth

It's clear I can see the dry grass at my feet
As we wait to go, you come home and I'll say
Baby I know

Babe I know, baby I know
That the course has drifted here
As we swim to land with our mouths full of sand
And say, baby I know

I'm all tired and my throats so dry
I feel I'm barely holding on
I'm gonna sit around here with this abscessed fear and say
Baby I know

Now there's something that I want that I'll never be
Burned out full of love
Now sometimes I lay here half awake and say, baby I know
Now sometimes I lay here half awake and say, baby I know

// Intro //

Well we got the whole night left to losing
Babe, there's nothing I'd rather doing
Babe it's just to be so close to you
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that there's nothing around here baby
This part of town to get crazy
Acting the fool and being lazy
...

// Coolin' Out //

I've been coolin' out baby
Now I might be fool enough maybe
And now I want to hear you say it
Say that love ain't enough to carry
Now it might be that I'm being swayed in a lie

Are you standing in the shadows or standing in the waves
The heat's got you dizzy and you're red in the face
Warm summer breeze but it's cold at my place
I feel the rhythm and you're on the chase

I said baby, come on
We'll be dancing and having fun
Tell your mama that you're leaving home
And your friends are gonna come along

And I've been coolin' out baby
And I want to hear you say it
Baby it's not broke not mending
And you can't always catch it baby
Buy me a hook
Sing me a song
Find me crooked broken and wrong
I found myself in the way...

I said baby, come on
We'll be dancing and having fun
Tell your mama that you're leaving home
And your friends are gonna come along
We'll be coolin' and carrying on

I've been coolin' out baby...

// Baby I Lost My Way (But I'm Going Home) //

Now the weight I know and the weight I've seen
You look tired and worn, you were almost beat
Now the weight I found
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home

I've been stumbling down the mountain
I've been stumbling by the sea
I've been stumbling in the dust
I can't taste it on my teeth
But the weight I know
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home

Been pushing through a crowd on an empty street
Everything that you worked for but still can't see
Baby take it from someone who knows, I'm trying hard just to get back home
Only thing honey that I need is your arms around me

Now the love I found how it weighs on me
Are you tired and worn or maybe I can't see
Baby don't let go
Baby I lost my way but I'm going home

// You Worry Me //

I'm alright today
You gonna find a way to cross and you gonna get there
And I'm on fire today
Ain't no water here to calm or even put me out
I'll find a better way
Am I crazy or the wind is gonna blow me down?

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

You seem tired today
Were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring?
I feel fine today
I've had dreams of you in places I've not seen before
You get so carried away
Like lovers new to bodies first to touch you here
This ain't a getaway
You build walls around your heart to try to lock it in

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

And upon the wind it's carried
Over the cities and the plains
You got time, you're on the mend babe
And everybody wants the same
Everybody wants the same thing

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

'Cause you worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me
You worry me

// Still Out There Running //

Yeah baby, we'd set the whole thing on fire
I was the king of standing alone
Looking back to see how far you've flown
I ain't grown and I ain't changed at all

Yeah honey, you could say I'm afraid
Afraid my voice don't even sound the same
There's some pitch I can't even hear at all
Push my voice now to hear it stall
I'm choking on every word

Yeah maybe, we could find a place to stretch our wings
Rest upon cliffs overlooking scenes
Scenes we don't write and we don't fall between
Ah, we're just falling again

Wake me up
See the fire has fully surrounded us
Hey I know as I'm coughing up all the ashes
Of the friends and the love I used to know
It's still out there running

Yeah baby, we could set the whole thing ablaze
Watch the crowd's eyes open amazed
They're just standing in the smoke of the dead
Hear them whispering their stories man
It'll never change the time they're gone

Hey honey, you think that I'm a fool to be
So deep in it now that I can't see
I just wait for you to call my name
Ain't it always been the same
We just keep passing on the wrong time

Yeah maybe, maybe we'll go to the other side of town
Remember that old house, baby we ran down
The nights on the floor were so perfect then
Remember when the sun was coming up that red
And the fire in our bed

Yeah baby, we could set the whole thing on fire
I was the king of standing alone
Looking back to see how far you've flown
I ain't grown and I ain't changed at all
Looking down to see how far you've fallen

Wake me up
You see the fire has fully surrounded us
Hey I know as I'm choking upon the ashes
Of the friends and the love I used to know
I used to know back then

// Tearing At The Seams //

Wait, did you think that I would break underneath the pressure and the...

Now the heart if not to feel
Is a wandering waste in the driest land
Now form these heights of this hills
There's a funny thing that no one else can see

There's a liar, a liar on the stage with a young child's eyes
And it happens all wrong and only half of its seen from here

Where has all the time gone
In separate ways it runs long
A hundred miles built upon us
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been
Tearing at the seams of all that's been

Wait, is this a game or am I walking into a snare?
Now these lies will spread until we are choking on the innocent

They have half of us tied and half of us in chains
We're all covering our eyes and covering our mouths just the same

Where's all the time gone
In separate ways it runs long
A hundred miles built upon us
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been
Tearing at the seams of all that's been
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been

They're gonna have to drag us away...

// I'll Be Damned //

We were staying home to get away
Tryna loose through the hole but it's still too late
Don't sigh on me
don't size me up at all
We were back in awe with a bellyache
You can sit in a hole, you can say you believe
I'm in awe
I'm forgetting everything

Well, don't corner me
Ya got nerve to be
Goddamn, your broke feeling's such a foolish thing

See it's good to be out and alone in the world
'Cause nobody cares, and they never did anyway

You can pack that notion in a hate
You can blank my face, ya can bury me
I'm one and all
I'm one on every side
We were spinning in, we were outta date
You been giving it hell or so you think
I'm barrelin' in
I'm barely here at all

You think it's a funny thing
You think it's sex all day
Goddamn ya, Goddamn ya
It's got all of me
Or at least their teeth
It don't bother me
It don't bother me

See it's good to be out
And alone in the world
'Cause nobody cares
And they never did anyways

// Boiled Over //

Sometimes you don't say it
sometimes you don't want to
and I didn't [?] you
I didn't ask you

Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easy but you just don't say

Sometimes you just wait
sometimes you just wait through
And when you're naked
I wanna be next to you
All that I want and I feel so fine
Get on your knee, so I can tell you

Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easier, I wanna say
Tell me that I'm more than I am
What if I'm falling?

So I didn't take it
I didn't have to take you
[?]

Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easier, I wanna say
I, I, I
