Album: TheFuture

// The Future //

Is the future open?
Is the future seen?
You'd have to pray forever and if you don't believe
They'll come down on you
From the longest fall

When they've all been vanquished and they've all been tried
Like it's some great penalty, but it's just their pride
And they got no follow-through
They hold the weakest stance

Yeah, well, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good

You say you thirst for vengeance and you crave for fire
On the roofs of innocence
You watch them rage and writhe
And it don't bother you
You feel so brave

You're standing in the water
You think that you've been saved
With your blind ignorance
In comes a crushing wave
Now see what drown men do in your watery grave

Well, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good
Yeah, they'll come to steal and divide
All that's good

Yeah, they'll come to steal and divide
Yeah, they come to steal and divide
All that's good
All that's good

// Survivor //

Well, you just think that I'm
Some great survivor
And you just build upon
The lies that carry you
Well, I don't even talk that way
See, I wanted you to stay
And show you the world's a better place
And as we crawl to find our way
We even take the shape of something else

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor

I'm afraid that the weight of the world is catching up with you
I'm afraid to admit that it's catching up to me, too

Well, you just think that I'm
Some great survivor
And you just feed upon
Fear you created
Some people ought to see
Some people ought to hear, hear
Some people ought to see
Some people ought to hear, mmm
Well, if it's gonna be that way
Then the crowd that calls your name can cast me out

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor

I'm afraid that the weight of the world is catching up with you
I'm afraid to admit that it's catching up to me, too
Does the weight continue to grow until it buries you?

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor

// Face Down In The Moment //

It careened and crashed while the other waved
And you waited in the sun so long that when you only wanted shade
Let the old men laugh, let the old men say
That I've never done nothing that wasn't out of love, baby
Now the weight that you carry seems such a heavy load while you're

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

Remember standing in the light
Remember crawling all the way
You paraded in the nighttime for a clean getaway
You were standing in the water, but only up to your knees
But you know a strong current could always sweep you off your feet
You were waiting for the right time
But can it take so long while you're

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

You were flowing blind
When they stole your name
You were planning a way out
When you lost your way
Bent to a hunch now
Like a broke-down show
Face down in the moment just a-waiting to let go

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

Keep waiting
Keep waiting
Keep waiting

You keep waiting on the night
You keep waiting on your pain
Every moment that you wait now is a moment slipped away
I think you're gonna have to come out and face all the fear you can't explain
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down and now it's time for you to see

See it
See it
See it
See it

Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go

// Something Ain't Right //

Gotta dig a lot of holes to get into something deep
Gotta sing a lot of soul to know how to feel it

You still feel alone
Well, at least it's your own
And I hope that you know
That I'm just calling out singing

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
Each time I'm alone, I just try to calm myself down

Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows I can't even see it

Part of me feels I've arrived
But sometimes, it don't align
Each time it begins to rhyme
I just feel so surprised that I talk to myself sometimes at night
When I can't sleep
Let my mind wander
It keeps wandering back to me

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
These scenes will play out in time
It's tangled up in all the lines that you wrote for yourself, baby

Gotta dig a lot of holes to get into something deep
Some of the folks you know, they can't even see it

Part of me that loves the life
Part of me that loves the ride
These scenes will play out in time
It's tangled up in all the lines that you wrote for yourself, babe
It's like throwing notes down a well, babe, and still being so surprised

Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right
Part of me that knows that something ain't right

// Love Me Till I'm Gone //

Here in the nighttime as it calls
Deepens the skyline until the dawn
It's like heaven sings in the wind
We watch the sunrise upon your skin

Well, I don't think I'm the better man
And it's in these hours that we fade
Will you hold me tight when you're close and then?
Will you love me when I'm worn out and I start to cave?

These kind of moments come in waves, you know
Some take your breath and fill your days
It's a powerful love you want to know
Ah, as we walk hand in hand
I'm just here to say that ya

We want back time that we never have
Hours just turn into days
To love me now like you loved me then
And will you love me even when you know that I'm wrong?

We want back time that we never have
And the hours just turn into days
To love me now as you love me then
Can you promise that it never fades?
If I run out of things to say
I'm lost and I can't find my way
But I still keep calling your name
If you love me, love me, love me until I'm gone

// Baby I Got Your Number //

Come in late at night when I'm alone
You want what's right, but you tell me all the time
That I only seem to do it wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

He can't jump a hurdle and I can't run
He came by in the middle of the night
To tell me that I was wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

Maybe when things are right and I feel strong
I'll move on to try the things that I find
Only realizing that I'm wrong

Baby, I've got your number
I'll call you when I get home
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone
Now I've got your number, baby
I'll never leave you alone

// What If I //

What if I just can't discover?
What if I'm just taking too long?
Or I'm wrong, my vision is cluttered
I'm stumbling on

What if I just quit tomorrow?
What if I just tuck and run?
If there ain't no line to follow
Well, how will you know?

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of letting it show
And of all this piled together
The least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half the cards are shown
Maybe as time goes on together
We'll learn how to grow

What if I can't take the heartache?
What if I don't want to know?
What if all I found was darkness leading to none?

Well, come on, just leave the light on
Give me air and clear the room
'Cause if I don't find an answer
I fear I'll fold

What if I can't wait any longer?
And I'm scared of letting it show
And of all these piled together
The least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see what you cannot believe
When only half the cards are shown

Maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it

// I'm On Your Side //

Did you realize or you can't remember?
Well, adjust your eyes and let 'em clear
But if you ain't alright
Well, just remember
I'm on your side

I'm on your side
Through thick and thin and any line
We'll cross divides and we will stand in hope and light
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side

Came into the light and it felt like thunder
But in your eyes, it just appears
You're dug in tight
In your opinion, there's just two sides
It won't align in a capsized culture
Leaned in the right and then it veered
And in its time, is it wonder or is it fear?

I'm on your side
Through thick and thin and any line
We'll cross divides and we will stand in hope and light
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side

Now there's a chance to see if we just open up our eyes
And if you can't believe, come on, please just try

But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side
But if you ain't all right, just remember
I'm on your side

// So Put Out //

Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know

You're loud and run your mouth
You aim to turn around
I know it ain't that way, but anyway

You set a wildfire, you think it's cut its path
But the wind just turns and laughs at you
You held me when I had nothing to say
Well, some things are lost on truth

Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know

You held the seeds that you think would turn to grass
But the days of growth have passed for you
We had all eyes on and man, I get so put out
Hearing the lies you do

Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know
Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know

// Oh, I //

Oh, I
I've got the rhythm and I can feel
And I feel it come in waves
Until the morning, we can't stand still
I've gone from empty to overfilled

And in the morning when you cannot wake
Cover your eyes when you're afraid
It's a part of every song you sang
Tell me I've been

Oh, I
I've got the feeling that I can heal
It's in the willingness to be still
And I feel it come in waves
It's a feeling that has to change

I can't just stand and wait
Heaven, I've been wrong
What more can one face
Just to stumble on?

Tell me I've been
War in me, tearing me
War in me, it's tearing me
War in me, it's tearing me
War in me, tearing me down
War in me, tearing me
War in me, tearing me
War in me, tearing me

// Love Don't //

Lately I've been feeling this way, tell me if I'm wrong
Only thing I felt in weeks, is when I leaned in to know

Singing, Love don't treat ya like that
Nope when it's around
Love won't treat you like that
No honey no

Hey Mama, can't stand around and sing
Hey baby, where we gonna be
Hey Mama, I'm tired of what I see
And I can't bother to wait if people don't want to change

Saying, Love don't treats ya like that
Don't tell me I don't know
I know that love won't treat you like that
I won't let go

Ain't it time now when we rise up and we fight it
Say you're a lover man
Then tell me why why why what's it gonna take to know that

Love don't treat ya like that, babe I'm letting you know
Saying love don't treat ya like that ya I know

Only thing I wanted was to try and find a new way
Lately I've been feeling that it might be the ending of days

Saying, Love don't treat ya like that, just don't let go
Ya love don't treat ya like that, I'm letting you know

It's a time we find a new way
Even if they come from all sides
They trying to turn us in to criminals
Well come anyway
And you wondered how
Take me, I won't hesitate to tell them
That Love won't treat ya like that babe I'm letting you know

Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know

We're preyed upon in their little game and we cry
Deep in the night deep in your woes
Baby I can't let em and I won't let go

There's a line in the sands
I think we'll have to cross it man
If if I got got ttttell ya
Tell ya why why why why why

Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that I'm not letting go
