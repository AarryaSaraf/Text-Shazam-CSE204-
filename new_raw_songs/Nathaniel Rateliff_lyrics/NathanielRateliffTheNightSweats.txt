// I Need Never Get Old //

Can we be there
Oh just think of the time
Thought of love so strange
Said you never knew
While I try my best
To cover our eyes
It's a common way to blame and hide the truth

I know that some will say
It matters but little babe
Ah but come on and mean it to me
I need it so bad

I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

Taking our time
Ah just standing in the rain
Meaning what you said
Ah and mean it to me
All of these lies
Oh and never again
Come on and say it now say it's a game

I know that some will say
It matters but little babe
Ah but come on and mean it to me
I need it so bad
Ah mean it to me
I need it so bad

I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I said I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I said I needed to try
Needed to fall now baby
I needed your love I'm burning away
I need never get old

I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old
I need never get old

// Howling At Nothing //

Some are waving it around
Someone carried me home
One was never noticed sleeping on the floor
But I know we were there

Some were playing around
Some were dipping so low
It never seemed to matter as the night slipped away
Cause there was soul in the air

We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
Danced until we flat out falling into bed
But I wonât let you go

So let me in or let me down
Let me lay here so slow
Baby just keep holding got to move our feet
Cause you know it ainât end

Step it in or step it out
Cut it all in and run
Kept on 'til it mattered baby I donât even see
But I know we were there

We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
Danced until we flat out falling into bed
But I wonât let you go

We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
Danced until we flat out falling into bed
And I wonât let you go

Danced until we flat out falling into bed
Said I wonât let you go

// Trying So Hard Not To Know //

You keep changing your mind for so many reasons
From what I can tell
You just might as well
Lay down and choke on your own

I can't give you enough to just keep believing
This shit don't run well
It's burned out as hell
And it's trying so hard not to know

You're filling it up just to turn out on empty
God damn I know just how it feels
I'm gonna tear out all that's inside me
Look away from here
Cause nobody cares
And they're trying so hard not to know

You take all of you want haven't found any answers
Look down and stare and I run around and yell
That it might not rain any more

You never stand up long enough to pull it together
Well who gives a damn and very few can
When they're trying so hard not to know

// I've Been Failing //

Well I needed you and not just someone
Iâve been so long failing you dear
I said Iâd care for all of this darling
Yet I buried all of it again

Ah yeah come on baby
Yeah it could be good
Honey
Itâs just the two
Of us now

Now that all seems dark and light has gone away
Iâve been out there bending in the wind
Now Iâm standing here to be beside you
And for all I know and all I care

I said donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry
Donât you weep and donât you worry

Iâve been failing you
Iâve been failing you
Iâve been failing you
Iâve been failing you

But I canât stop trying
But I canât stop trying
But I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying
Oh but I canât stop trying
Oh I canât stop trying

// S.O.B. //

I'm gonna need someone to help me
I'm gonna need somebody's hand
I'm gonna need someone to hold me down
I'm gonna need someone to care
I'm gonna writhe and shake my body
I'll start pulling out my hair
I'm gonna cover myself with the ashes of you
And nobody's gonna give a damn!!!

Son of a bitch, give me a drink
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean I'm gonna drink my life away

Now for seventeen years I've been throwing them back
Seventeen more will bury me
And somebody please just tie me down
Or somebody get me a goddamn drink

Son of a bitch, give me a drink!
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch!
If I can't get clean I'm gonna drink my life away
Hey! Hey!

My heart is breaking, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me!
My heart is breaking, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
My heart was aching, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
My heart was aching, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me

Son of a bitch, give me a drink
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean I'm gonna drink my life away
Son of a bitch, give me a drink
Son of a bitch
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean I'm gonna drink my life away
Yeah ah

// Wasting Time //

Think of all the time time time
You get to know it
Think about the world I found spinning awry
Remember all the clothes I wore to hide it from you
You said letâs take the long walk home tonight

Think of all the falling down and the hiding under
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the hours I spent in constant reflection
Well it gets you down but it donât make it right
I made it my personal intervention
What a waste of time time time time time

I got a feeling I, I canât get over
Maybe all we had has always been right
Think of all the love you gain when you send it over
Think of all the wool Iâve spun to be here tonight
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time

When I weep let me be
Look it here baby it's all I got

// I'd Be Waiting //

If I go home oh with a howlin' bend
If you ever get lonely if you never did
I count the hours you come round again

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you

If all this seems like I carry my head so low
If I don't sing I'd be waiting on call from home
My moan and wait can't carry this on and on

I'd be standing in the corner
I'd be waiting just to hold ya
I'd be
Waiting pretty baby just to dance with you

Somehow they're gone
Somehow they're playing
I'm tired and worn
But I'm still standing

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you

I'm just saying hmm hmm baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby
I'd be waiting ah baby just to dance with you

// Mellow Out //

Someone came in rushing dragging feet and nails and I could pretend
Wanting more of nothing feel it wearing on me
Just keep it hid

Mellow out and find a better way youâre feeling it shut down
Take it easy baby maybe find some time to just calm down
Keep on telling me

Laid a scarring on me I was thinking maybe I got it in
I could hand it to you it doesnât matter if youâre not in the biz
Way to pressure till itâs looking like it finally broke down
Letâs bury it together and maybe find some time to just sit down
Keep on telling me

Mellow out and find a better way youâre feeling it shut down
Take it easy baby maybe find some time to just calm down
Keep on telling me
