// Parlor //

Last night in at the parlor
And I ain't other boys in the band
While I stood there in the corner
And I wait for a feeling to dance
Every woman and their baby
Better call them all if you can
[?] and them swinging
Than to be there slapping your hands

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't be standing in the corner
And I wait for the feeling to dance
I said "Aaahhh"

Last night in a parlor
I was only taking [?]
But I held myself together
While the ache was [?] taking me down

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't be standing in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance

It was late night in the parlor
Well we made [?]
Don't you ache
Don't you want it
I'll twist and shake it again

I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't just stand in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance
I said "Aaahhh"

// I Did It //

Oh nah baby don't you do it wrong
I did it (I did it)
If I crack don't let it keep it going
I did it (I did it)
Break my back work my own
If I lie don't do me wrong
I did it (I did it)

Come on baby don't you make me wake but
I did it (I did it)
If I fall I feel so weak
I did it (I did it)
Break my back say my name
Don't be crash don't be claim
Oh now baby why won't you shake and scream
I did it (I did it)

She said maybe your just lazy
Not even trying I'm doing like I want you to
I did it (I did it)

Come on baby I know your lazy
Not afraid but you can't turn out like I want you to

I did it (I did it)

// Out On The Weekend (Version 2) //

Out on the weekend
I was standing in the corner
Laughing about
You can follow the rain or let the tears come out
It's standing right over you
Out on the weekend

I remember carrie farro
I was to old to dance
Always find the beat and the time
She talking out all the traps
Man she knew all the steps
With the fall and rise
She had a feel for it all
The fall and the raise she had a feel for it all

Out on the weekend
Send the children to bed and let the drinks come out
We'll play favorite records and kiss on the mouth
All our friends are over, yeah
Out on the weekend
I remember Jack and Nicole
Man, they were the perfect pair
They always brought to sleep on the ground
Man they were that perfect sound
Laughing until the sun come out
He'd run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
He'd run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
I remember I was feeling alone remembering you
I remember that the world could fall
But, what was I to do babe
Out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah

I remember so many things with you
Out on the weekend

// Wasting Time (Live) //

(Hey... hey...)

Think of all the time time time
You get to know it
Think about the world I found spinning awry
Remember all the clothes I wore to hide it from you
You said let's take the long walk home tonight
Think of all the falling down and the hiding under
I think of all the time time time time time

(Hey... hey...)

Think of all the hours I spent in constant reflection
Well, it gets you down but it don't make it right
I made it my personal intervention
What a waste of time time time time time

(Hey... hey... hey...)

I got a feeling I, I can't get over
Maybe all we had has always been right
Think of all the love you gain when you send it over
Think of all the wool I've spun to be here tonight

I think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
I think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time

// What I Need //

Carry on
Whatever I need, yeah
And though it seems
Won't be tried
What if I am
Alone again?

It's been a long time and I get so paralyzed
Well, me and my loneliness will hide
Only long for what I see
Yeah, only my heart can find my feet

It's a heartbeat
It's a hard soul
Heartbeat
It's a hard soul
It's what I need to hold
It's what I need to hold

One more try
All that I did, I did
With my back, I did
Just another hour and I'll get to run
When I'm untied, you know I'll run
I know there's a fear
And only

It's a heartbeat
It's a hard soul
Heartbeat
It's a hard soul
It's what I need to hold
It's what I need to hold

It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need
It's what I need, baby
It's what I need

// Just To Talk To You //

I was thinking about you
Out stuck along the way
Many people passing me by
Even when I show a little leg

If I could just thump on in
It never works that way
Tried to forget about it baby, and
Drown myself in a drink

But somebody knocked me off my chair and said

"You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
They said, "You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

So I picked myself up off the floor
Like one big bruise
I think a couple of broken ribs
Some mother stole my shoes
Now I'm gonna have to walk it off
Tear up my feet
It's just another reminder, baby, that
Nothing works for me

Then a cop stopped and picked me up

He said, "You got a friend you, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
He said, "You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

Then the lump on my head
Stale bread, and old cold coffee
What's a fella got to do
To get a call and just talk to you
Get a call and just talk to you
Get a call and just talk to you

Then they said they'd loan me a dime

They said, "You got a fried, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you

They said, "If you've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
They said, "If you've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

I mean, "You've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

// How To Make Friends //

I was on the short list
Of people most hated
You were right above me
Or no one ever told you
I'm content to lay here
How'd we ever come to be so stiff?

Maybe I should crawl out
Hide myself in the waves of doubt

Everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you
When everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you

Never to confront you
Man, but who would really want to?
We could write a letter
For them to read together
You hate because you're lazy
And me, I've always been afraid

Well, no one really sold you
You really got your hands in you

Everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you
When everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you

Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you

// Late Night Party (Out On The Weekend Version 1) //

Out on the weekend
I was standing in the corner
Laughing about
You can follow the rain or let the tears come out
It's standing right over you
Out on the weekend

I remember Carrie Farro
She was never too old to dance
Always found the beat and the time
Taking out all the taps
Man, she knew all the steps
The fall and the rise, feel for it all
The fall and the rise, feel for it all

Out on the weekend
Send the children to bed, let the drinks come out
Play our favorite records, kiss on the mouth
All our friends are over
Out on the weekend

I remember Jack and Nicole
Man, they were the perfect pair
They always brought a blanket to sleep on the ground
Man, they were that perfect sound
Laughing until the sun came out
Run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
Run his hands through her hair, she just smiled

Out on the weekend
Another late night party, all her friends came out
And we all got naked in the pool, but who cares now?
I remember so many things with you
Out on the weekend
