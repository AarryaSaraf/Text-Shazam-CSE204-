// Radio Ga Ga //

Radio

Radio

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old-time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

Radio

So, don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, radio

All we hear is "Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga"
All we hear is "Radio ga ga
"Radio blah blah"
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, radio

All we hear is "Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga"
All we hear is "Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga"

All we hear is "Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah"
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you

(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, radio

// It's A Hard Life //

I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living
With a broken heart

This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something
To fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

Yes, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

(Yeah!) It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
It's a long hard fight (hard fight!)
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself
And say I did it for love

Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love

// Man On The Prowl //

Hey, I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl

I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So, honey, come home
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home - come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

Well, I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I gotta teach my baby dancin'
But I am no Fred Astaire

So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah
Baby, baby, baby, look out - man on the prowl

Baby, come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
Baby, come home - oh, yeah
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

So, honey, come home - come home
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah
Man on the prowl, yeah, hey

Steady there
Loosen up, whoo!

// Machines (Or Back To Humans) //

Machines, machines
Machines, machines
Machines machines
Machines, machines

It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock'n'roll

They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one, but no one can wrest me away

Back to humans

We have no disease, no troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace, no regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat

What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that machine, boys
With random-access memory

Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold

Its software, its hardware
Its heartbeat, its time-share
Its midwife's a disk drive
Its sex life is quantised
Its self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised

Back to humans
Back to humans

Back to machines
Machines
Machines
Machines
Machines

Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Humans

Machine world
It's a machine's world

Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Back to humans
Living in a new world
How you gonna last?

Machine world
Machine world
Machine world

Change

Machine world

Yeah, I'm coming

Back to humans
Back to humans
Back to humans

Living in a new world
How you gonna last?
Machine world
It's a machine's world

// I Want To Break Free //

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

// Keep Passing The Open Windows //

This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
'Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

Do you know what it is like
To be alone in this world
When you're down and out
On your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming
In the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing
Everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down
And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling
And you're on your way

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

Do you know how it feels
When you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money
To spend, you're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days
You're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger, yeah
That same old feeling
Just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself
It's gonna be the end
Oh, get yourself together
Things are looking better every day

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
'Cause love is all you need

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
'Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Baby, love is all you need

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows

// Hammer To Fall //

Yeah!

Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light, yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah

(You don't waste no time at all)
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
(It comes to you as to us all)
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah

Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays, yeah

(Tow your line and play their game)
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
('Til one day they call your name)
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same
Yeah baby (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain

For he who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder

(What the hell we fighting for?)
Oh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
(Just got time to say your prayers)
Eh, while you're waiting
For the hammer to, hammer to fall

Hey, it's
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall
Hammer
Woo! Yeah, yeah
Woo, woo!
Ha, yeah, waiting
For the hammer to fall, now baby
Yeah, yeah
While you're waiting
For the hammer to fall, ooh
Give it to me one more time!

// Is This The World We Created? //

Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

You know that every day a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere, a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?

If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can He think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

// I Go Crazy //

Yeah
Ha ha
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

Yeah, I took my baby dancing
To see a heavy band
But never saw my baby 'til the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
Didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, a man who'll fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock-and-roll clone
And leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more

Yeah
Yeah!
Go crazy, woo!
Yeah, yeah!

I don't wanna hurt you
Like you've been a-hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching, rolling on the floor
Next time you're on the TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, baby

All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

Ooh!
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta stay away from me, baby
Baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, woo!
