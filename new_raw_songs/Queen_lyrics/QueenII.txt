// Father To Son //

A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son, to son

And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building
On the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned
And the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Won't you hear us sing
Our family song?
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

Ooh yeah, now we hand it on

But I've heard it all before

Take this letter that I give you
Take it, sonny, hold it high
You won't understand
A word that's in it
But you'll write it all again
Before you die
Yeah, yeah

A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years 'til the loneliness is gone
(Sing if you will)
But the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son, father to son, father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son, to son

// White Queen (As It Began) //

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone

And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing unheard
Pleading one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare? What have thee seen
The mother of the willow green?
I call her name

And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

White queen, how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait

Dear friend, goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began

// Some Day One Day //

You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now, we both know how

No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day

Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
(You shall be a queen)

Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But some day, one day

When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung

So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But some day, one day
We'll come home

// The Loser In The End //

Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today

She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

She washed and fed
And clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "goodbye Ma"
And the night-times for her tears

She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

So listen, mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's not so long since you were young

You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes
That's not far to bend
You're Ma on whom they can always depend

// Ogre Battle //

Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

(Ah!)

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives forevermore

Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

// The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke //

He's a fairy feller
The fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
To see the feller crack a nut at night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
To deliver
The Master-Stroke

Ploughman, "Waggoner Will", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
What a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and a junketeer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow "can we see the Master-Stroke"
What a quaere fellow

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch-magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a quaere fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on Mr. Feller, crack it open if you please

// Nevermore //

There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore (Ah)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me, please
Don't send me to the path
Of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow (Ah)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Send me to the path
Of nevermore (Ah)
When you say you didn't love me
Anymore (Aah)
(Ah)

Nevermore
Nevermore

// The March Of The Black Queen //

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you and where do you go?

You've never seen nothing like it
No, never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive

Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose

Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black queen, marching single file

Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
March to the black queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun

Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
March to the black queen

Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
"Spread out your wings. You are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy."

In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even 'til the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black queen

My life is in your hands
I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy
I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black queen

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the black queen tattoos all her pies
She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her "I"s
She's our leader

Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil, beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone

(La la la la forever) forever
Ah ah ah ah ah

// Funny How Love Is //

Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

Funny, funny, funny

Funny how love is the end of lies
When the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
That's what love is
That's what love is

Funny how love can break
Your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down
With Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running
Wild and feeling free
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

Funny, funny, funny

From the earth below
To the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love
Do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is when you
Gotta hurry home 'cause you're late for tea

Funny, funny, funny how love is

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you got to make love do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

// Seven Seas Of Rhye //

Fear me you lords
And lady preachers
I descend upon your earth
From the skies
I command your very souls
You unbelievers

Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers
And privy counselors?
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man
Who dares abuse my trust

I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you
I belong to you forever (Ever, ever)

Storm the master-marathon
I'll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire
And I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature (I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)
And come out alive, then I'll get you
Be gone with you
You shod and shady senators
Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan
And his troubadours

And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
I do like to stroll upon the Prom, Prom, Prom!
Where the brass band plays "Tiddely-om-pom-pom!"

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
When I'm down beside the sea, I'm beside meself with glee
Beside the seaside! Beside the sea

// See What A Fool I've Been //

Well she's gone, dear, gone this morning
I wan' see what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord, guilty, cruel
Morning
Fool I've been
Yes, I did too much

Didn't leave me-me no letter
Didn't leave no warning
You naughty thing, you
Ooh - well, I guess I'm all to blame
Oh, Lord
I guess I'm all to blame

See you later
Say
Ciao
...night
Take it

Oh, my little dog ain't too hungry
No, no, he kept on barking
The vicious thing just don't seem the same
Oh, no, no
Just
Oh, tantrums
Said don't feel the same

Ooh, see you later
Now hit it like that

Coming up strong

Well, I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbor
She said, "Mm mm mm mm mm."
Oh, Lord, what a fool I've been

And then she told what to do
She said, "Go home."

Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord
What a fool I've been

Thank you
