// Keep Yourself Alive //

Taking off

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day

Now they say your folks are telling you
"Be a superstar,"
But I tell you just be satisfied
And stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive yeah
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays

Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
Well I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal

I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Shake

Ow!

Keep yourself alive (Whoa)
Keep yourself alive
Oh, take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Come on
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money
Honey you will survive

Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

// Doing All Right //

Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow?
Anyway, I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking 'round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
Every time in all the world 

Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway, I've got to hide away

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh

Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, God knows what I'm doing
Anyway, I should be doing all right

Doing all right

Doing all right

// Great King Rat //

Great King Rat died today

Born on the twenty-first of May
Died, syphilis, forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now hear this

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Show me

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Hit it!

Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple

Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival sure
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said "You're going to realize tomorrow"

No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

// My Fairy King //

Ah, ah

In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)

My fairy king (He rules the air and turns the tides)
He rules the air and can see things that are not there
For you and me to see (Ooh, yeah)
My fairy king (He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

(Ah) Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh)

They turn milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry, no salt from sand
And seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes (No more)

Someone, someone
Has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (Yeah)
I cannot run, I cannot hide

// Liar //

I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

(Liar!) I have sailed the seas
(Liar!) From Mars to Mercury
(Liar!) I have drunk the wine
(Liar!) Time after time
(Liar!) You're lying to me
(Liar!) Oh, you're lying to me

Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please, will you direct me in the right way?
Liar, liar, liar, liar!
Liar! (That's what they keep calling me)
Liar! (Every day, every night)
Liar, liar!
(Oh, let me go)

Listen!
Are you gonna listen?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna try to behave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
I'm gonna serve you 'til your dying day
(All day long)
I'm gonna keep you 'til your dying day
(All day long)
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
(All day long)
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long

Yeah! (we have lift-off!)

All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar, liar, they never ever let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
So now you know you could
Be dead before they let you
Aah

// The Night Comes Down //

When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun break in
Lucy was high and so was I
Dazzling, holding the world inside

Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

Oh, oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh, oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside

Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it

Oh, oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh, oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again

// Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll //

Had to make do with a worn out rock 'n' roll scene
The old bop is getting tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty-eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Something harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten-feet tall

Well I hope that a big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowing no fuse
And my musical life's feeling
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern-times rock 'n' roll
Modern-times rock 'n' roll

Get your high-heeled guitar-style boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Just gonna know who you are
Look out

Modern-times rock 'n' roll

// Son And Daughter //

I want you-ooh, ah
Woman

Tried to be a son and daughter
Rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?

I want you-ooh
To be a woman, yeah

Tried to be a teacher
And a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

Well, I traveled around
The world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?

I want you-ooh
To be a woman

I want you to be a woman, yeah
You know I'm gonna save the world
Now you've just begun
Alright!

// Jesus //

And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered 'round Him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (going down)
All going down

Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean, said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now
You're a new man instead

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus (right)
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down (going down to Bethlehem)
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man, that's right

All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down
To see the Lord Jesus
All going down

// Mad The Swine //

Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water

Three-feet tall
So very small
I'm no trouble
I bring thunder, lightning, sun and the rain
For all the people in the land

A message of love
I bring you from up above
All you children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along

They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

I walk upon the water
Just as before
I help the meek and the mild
And believers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small

Let me take you to the river
Without a fall
And then one day you'll realize
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say
Just like before

They call me mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

Ooh-ooh

Whoa, now

So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

Don't ever fail me

Mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you
Save you (Whoa, now)
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

Get down on my knees and praise the Lord
