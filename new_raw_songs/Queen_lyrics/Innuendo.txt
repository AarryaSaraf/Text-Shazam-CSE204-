Album: Innuendo

// Innuendo //

One, two, three, four
Ooh, ooh!

While the sun hangs in the sky
And the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea
And meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars
And the rainbow
'Til the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time
Ooh, ooh!

While we live according to race
Color or creed
While we rule by blind madness
And pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition
Superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time!

Through the sorrow
All through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free
Be free to yourself

Ooh, ooh, yeah!

If there's a god, or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason
To live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears
Release your mask

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whatever will be, will be

(We'll just keep on trying)
We'll just keep on trying
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time!

// I'm Going Slightly Mad //

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is, oh, so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you. Oh, dear

Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened. Oh, oh
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad

Oh, dear!

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top-billing

I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree

Oh, dear

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
Finally happened. Uh, huh
Finally happened
I'm slightly mad

Oh, dear!

Ooh-ooh-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ah-ah

I'm knitting with only one needle
Unraveling fast. It's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But, my dear, how about you?

I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened
Oh, yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!

// Headlong //

And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you can do about it

Nothin' you can do
No, there's nothin' you can do about it
No, there's nothin' you canâ, nothin' you canâ, nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
No, there's nothin' you can do about it

Yeah

Hey, he used to be a man
With a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman
With a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do

Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you canâ, nothin' you canâ, nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do (ho)
Soon the fire starts a raging
Gets 'em more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do

Ooh, now they start freaking every way you turn
You can't start walking 'cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
'Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight

You're rushin' headlong
Headlong
Out of control, yeah
You think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping
And there's nothing youâ, nothing youâ, nothing you can do about it at all

Yeah, yeah! Alright! Go!

And you're rushing headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing, nothing you can do about it, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ha-ha

Headlong
Headlong
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Headlong
Headlong
Headlong

[In reverse:]
Headlong, headlong, headlong, headlong

// I Can't Live With You //

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road
To get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying, "Baby, it's all right."
When deep inside
You're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves

Hold on, baby, tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you
I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But, baby, I'll never ever leave you

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
'Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No, I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness
Through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah!

Ooh, yeah
Yeah, I can't live
Without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh, I can't live without you
Baby, baby, baby
Without you, whoa yeah
I can't live without you

// Don't Try So Hard //

If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard

But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail, you mustn't grumble 
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging 'round you
Stay right where you are

Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh, you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey, but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

Oh, what a beautiful world
This is the life for me
Oh, what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me

Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard

// These Are The Days Of Our Lives //

Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect. You know?

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun

Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids

Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change

Those were the days of our lives. Yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you

I still love you

// Delilah //

Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're irresistible
You make me smile
When I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope
You make me laugh and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody
You're all claws and you bite
That's alright!

Delilah, Delilah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go
To sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over
My Chippendale suite

Delilah, Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eye
Meeow meeow meeow
Delilah, I love you, Delilah

Ooh, you make me so very happy
You give me kisses
And I go out of my mind, ooh
Meeow meeow meeow
You're irresistible, I love you, Delilah
Delilah, I love you

Hah-hah
You make me very happy
Oh yeah
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your, your, your kisses
I love your kisses

// The Hitman //

Here we go
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, I'm the hitman, stand aside
I'm the hitman, I want your life
Ain't no escaping, don't run and hide
There goes the neighborhood
(I'm gonna kill for your love)
That's right!

Hitman, now don't you cry
I'm just it, man, and you might get fried
Gun in my pocket, don't get me wrong
I'll be your hitman
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a head shredder
That's better!

Baby, baby, baby, I'm a hitman
Hitman, hitman (Yeah!)
Yeah, trouble in the East
Trouble in the West
Struggle with the beast
What a thief, what a pest
Come back mother
Nuke that sucker
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Who knows what I'm talking about?

Waste that brother
All right, ooh!
That's the way to do it, ah-ha!

I'm the hitman, I'm your prize
But this hitman
Can cut you down to size
Love me baby, don't be so cool
Love me, love me, baby
I've been to the hitman school
Yeah, yeah!
You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away

When the fun begins
(Hitman) Are you ready for the sting?
Gonna waste that thing
(Hitman) Hitman is king
Go, go, yeah, hitman, hitman
Oh yeah, ow!

// Bijou //

You and me
We are destined, you'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives
With each other
The rest of our days like two lovers
Forever, yeah
Forever
My bijou

// The Show Must Go On //

Empty spaces
What are we living for?
Abandoned places
I guess we know the score

On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime

Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

Show must go on
Show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens
I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance

On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now

Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

Show must go on
Show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

Show must go on
Show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on with the show
On with the show

Show must go on
