Album: SheerHeartAttack

// Brighton Rock //

Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell

"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me, pray
Nothing e'er need come between us
Tell me, love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday"
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell

Oh, Rock of Ages
Do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, Lady Moon, shine down
A little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase"
Oh no, I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays
Ooh
Ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

// Killer Queen //

She keeps MoÃ«t et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try

// Tenement Funster //

My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door
And my rock-and-roll 45s, been enraging the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual

Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
Young and you're crazy!

Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place

// Flick Of The Wrist //

"Dislocate your spine
If you don't sign" he says
"I'll have you seeing double"
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist
And you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist
He'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs
And then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

"Intoxicate your brain
With what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself," he says
"Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you 'til you've dried"

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize
(Big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a Muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist, and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

// Lily Of The Valley //

Baby, you've been had

I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no?
Neptune of the seas (seas)
Have answer for me, please (please)
The lily of the valley (valley)
Doesn't know

I lie in wait with open eyes (oo-ooh)
I carry on through
Stormy skies (oo-oo-oo-ooh)
I follow every course
(Follow every course)
My kingdom for a horse
(Kingdom for a horse)
But each time I grow old (oo-oo-oo-wah)
Serpent of the Nile (Nile)
Relieve me for a while (while)
And cast me from your spell
And let me go (oo-oo-ooh, let me go)

Messenger from Seven Seas
Has flown (ooh, oo-oo-ooh)
To tell the King of Rhye
He's lost his throne (Aah)
Wars will never cease (cease)
Is there time enough for peace? (Peace)
But the lily of the valley (valley)
Doesn't know

// Now I'm Here //

Here I stand
Look around, around
Around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a, just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared
Didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby
I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around (think I'll stay around, around)
Around, around, around, around (around, around, around, around)
Down in the city just as you and me (down in the city just as you and me)
Don't I love you so

Go, go, go, little queenie!

// In The Lap Of The Gods //

Leave it in the lap of the gods

I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the gods
What more can I do?

Leave it in the lap of the gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the gods
Leave it in the lap of the gods
I want you to
Leave it in the lap of the gods
Leave it in the lap of the gods
Leave it in the lap of the gods

Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods
Lap of the gods

// Stone Cold Crazy //

Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going 'round
Gotta clear outta town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry-fish bone

Here come the law
Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never
I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon
I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore
Cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Hit 'em up

Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and get a me
I gotta get me get up and run

They got the sirens loose
I ran right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Ow!

// Dear Friends //

So dear friends your love is gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won

Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon

// Misfire //

Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Don't you know honey, that love's a game?
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight

Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night

Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire, misfire

Misfire

// Bring Back That Leroy Brown //

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown (back)

Bet your bottom dollar bill
You're a playboy (yeah, yeah!)
Daddy cool, with a ninety-dollar smile
(Woo, woo, woo, woo-yeah)
Took my money out of gratitude
And he get right out of town (well)
I gotta getty up
Steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude (babe)

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown (yeah)

Big, bad Leroy Brown
He got no common sense (no, no)
He got no brains
But he sure got a lot of style
Can't stand no more in this, here, jail
I gotta rid myself of this sentence
Gotta get out the heat
Step into the shade
Gotta get me there
Dead or alive (babe)

(Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy, woo, woo)
(Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy Brown)

(Well)

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown (back)

Big mama Lulu Belle
She had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey Chile away
But she met him down
At the station (ooo-hoo)
Put a shotgun to his head
And unless I be mistaken (mistaken)
This is what she said
"Big bad big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie"

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)

Big bad caused a mighty
Fine sensation (yeah, yeah)
Gone and got himself elected President
(We want Leroy for President)
Next time you gotta
Hit a bitty baddy weather
This time like a shimmy shammy leather
He's a big boy, bad boy Leroy
I don't care where you get him from

Bring that big, bad Leroy back
Want him back

// She Makes Me (Stormtrooper In Stilettoes) //

My love
She makes me
She is my heart
She is my love
She is my love

I know
I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
But the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so

I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love

Who knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know how long I'll take
And if I'm very slow she makes me so

She is my love
She is my love

// In The Lap Of The Gods (Revisited) //

It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and
Forgive me when I ask you, "Where do I belong?"
You say, "I (You can do it) can't (You can do it)
(You can go and set him free) Set you free from me"
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the gods

Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the gods

Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
It's in the lap of the gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
