// A Human Body //

They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur
Captain Scott and his heroes to be
To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh it's been such a long ride
Ooh you know it's been a long way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
With a human body you see

There ain't nobody gets out of this moonlight
Today is surprisingly fair
Oh oh oh oh woo woo

We've got problems the Lone Ranger can't fix
The invisible man couldn't see
It takes a tough guy
To learn some new tricks
Ooh it takes such a long time
Ooh it's been such a long way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
With a human body you see

You know it's been such a long while
It's been such a long while
Takes such a long time
It takes such a long time
It's been such a long way
Been such a long way
It's been such a long while
Been such a long while
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
It's gonna be a long ride

// Breakthru (Real Drums And Bass) //

I wake up
I feel fine
Your face
Chills my spine
Honey, you're touching something deep inside of me
Honey, you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh, I love it, love that one

Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
But everybody knows your looks at me
Honey, you're sparking something deep inside of me
A flame that's burning brightly, it's taking over me
I'm outta control, outta my head, can't you see, baby?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru

Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru, breakthru

Ha
Somebody else is up first
Somebody else is up first

Growing up (Who says that?)
It's hard for you (Tell me about it)
Everybody tells you so
But you oughta know
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Maybe you're breathing in somebody else's air
Maybe you're trapped in somebody else's sordid life affair

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru

It could be a breakthru
It could be a breakthru
Hey, yes sir
It could be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru
Ah, ah, I love it

// Dog With A Bone //

Hey, you say you won't, you can't give me any more love
You say you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it
You make me high when I talk on the phone
You know I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
'Cause you gotta hold on me, baby, like a dog with a bone
Hey, hey
Like a dog with a bone, yeah
Dog with a bone
One more time, yeah

Hey, you say you won't, you can't give me any more love
But you say that you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it

You know I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
You gotta hold on me, baby, like a dog with a bone, yeah, yeah
Dog with a bone
Dog with a bone

You make me high when you talk on the phone
Ring up your number when I know you ain't home
Going on, and we're playin' together

You make me high when you talk on the phone
Ring up your number when I know you ain't home
Hold on me baby, like a dog with a bone
Hey, hey
Dog with a bone, yeah

You say you won't, you can't give me any more love
But you say you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it
You make me high when I talk on the phone
I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
You gotta hold on me, baby
Like a dog with a bone

Dog with a bone
(Dog with a bone)

// Face It Alone //

When somethin' so near and dear to life
Explodes inside, you feel your soul is set on fire
When somethin' so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone

When somethin' so dear to your life
Explodes inside, you feel your soul is burned alive (Burned alive)
When somethin' so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone

When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone

// Feelings, Feelings //

One, two, three
Woo

Gotta get rid of this feeling, I'm feeling done
Yes, I've gotta get rid of this feeling that's under my tongue (Keyset)
I've been waiting so long, I've got to be all the fingers and thumbs
Oh, sitting all alone with just a feeling, I'm feeling bad
Yes, that feeling is driving me, it's driving me mad
Oh, now that I'm here, got to give you all that I ever had
Sure do

Now that I'm here, I can see you so clearly
It's the way I should say it
It's not what I say, it's the way that I say it
It's not how I play, it's the way that I play it
Ooh, wooh, wooh, yeah, I feel, yeah

Now, that I'm here
Oh, got to get a rid of this feeling I'm feeling inside, yes
Got to get you into that feeling that's driving me mad, alright, baby
Oh, now that I'm here, I've got to give you all that I ever had
Stop
Yes

// Flash //

Flash! A-ah!
Savior of the Universe
Flash! A-ah!
He'll save every one of us

Seemingly there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[Dale:] What's happening, Flash?
Only Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation

Flash! A-ah!
He's a miracle

This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm

Flash! A-ah!
King of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, it's the mighty flash

General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching
[General Kala:] What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching? Open fire! All weapons! Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body

Flash! A-ah!
Gordon's alive!

Flash! A-ah!
He'll save every one of us

Just a man with a man's courage
You know he's nothing but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Dale:] Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!

// I Guess We're All Falling Out (Demo) //

Ooh (Heh, heh)
Hang on, I better make sure this is right

You stabbed your knife right in my back
Was it just something that I might have said
Does this mean we're falling out
I guess this means that our love is stalling out

If you wanna make a go
Ooh, that dirty mind has done a lot of staying here

I guess we're falling out
It was just one gong and on our way
I guess we're falling out
Yes, dear, falling out
La, da, da, I wanna stay

You stabbed your knife right in my head
Oh no, we're done, I'm on top of my head
Threw my clothes right into the street
Told me to go, and that was just a treat
De, de, de, da, da, la, la, da, da
De, do, da, da, da, da, da, on our way

I guess we're falling out (Yeah)
It was just one long race
I guess we're falling out
Falling out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, falling out, falling out, yeah
To me

That's good, that's good, that's good
That's good
So, we suddenly open I'm on the
La, la, la, la, la, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, hey
Wa, na, na, na
And we go back to that thing
Yeah, we just go to
Can't
Da, da, da, da, I'm falling out
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Falling out
Falling out, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's falling out, I don't care
Rama, llama
Yeah, my babe
And now let's go, go

We're falling out, uh
Hey
Okay, stop, yeah
Sounds nice
Is it worth listening to that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
That's nice, just get a tempo

// Let Me In Your Heart Again //

Uh, ooh
Yeah

When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again

(Your heart again) Yeah
Your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

When you have to face the blues
I give you satisfaction
(It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction
(It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart you're breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain

(Your heart again) Oh
(Your heart again) Heart again
Let me in your heart again

Oh, my love
I want you to stay
Don't leave me now
Or I'll just fade away
Oh, my love, don't hurt me this way

Oh, forgive me, babe
Do not ever tell me goodbye
Ooh
Tell me yes
Oh
Don't make me wait too long
Or I'll lose my mind

When people talk of love
I have no hesitation
(It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold that conversation for you, baby
(It's your heart again)
(Ooh) But when I look away, huh
(Ooh) People know my mind is straying, baby
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again (Heart again)

Your heart again (Heart again)
Oh, (Let me in) let me in your heart again (Your heart again)

Open the doors for me, baby
To your heart again
Let me in
Hey, let me
Let me live, uh
Whoo!
Let me live and live in your heart again

// Lost Opportunity //

With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
(That's what they say)
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity

Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
And every afternoon 
You'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
(Oh yes they do)
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
Gone with my lost opportunity

// Love Of My Life (Live) //

Are you in the mood for um, singing?
Give us a little help with this. This is "Love Of My Life"
You remember this?

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You don't know it
It's alright

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)
I still love you
I still love you love you love you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh hurry back, hurry back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, yeah

Thank you

She knows that I love me
Freudian slip!

My lady

// No-One But You (Only The Good Die Young) //

A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven?
Do you want us to cry?

And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No-one could reach them
No-one but you

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you

Another tricky situation
I get to drownin' in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?

Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever

And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?

And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye

And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no-one
No-one but you

// Rain Must Fall (Demo) //

I can see it, oh

I can see it in your stars
Life is getting so exciting
Driving in your car
Your world is so inviting
But you're in position
To call the shots
Let me loose, hmm, honey

No problem

But into every life a little
But into every life a little rain must fall

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
In property and finance
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious, honey

Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall

Others seem to think
You are overdramatizing
Problems at work
Must be rather irritating
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, uh

It's cool

You want to clear your reputation
But into every life a little rain must fall

He said, "I don't," he said, "I don't."
He said, "I don't feel the same."
Oh, but [?]
Come on

Gone this morning
"See what a fool I've been, oh Lord," I said
What a foolâMerry Christmas, everybodyâI've been

Always needed to be somebody?

// Water (Demo) //

Since I've been trying to put my life in order
Older that I learned and needing, burning
Been trying to put my corners in a
Hole that's round, that can't be smooth

I have to stop and think sometimes
Let the water roll a while
Let the days go by under my feet

Let me out, let me out of the water I'm in
Let me out of the hole that's been
Let them know the rain, looking for the other way

Looking for an answer to that
Something that I love, I'm breathing
Ain't no kind of way I'll see you
I don't know love can fit this way

I have to stop and think sometimes
Let the water roll awhile
Let the days go by under my feet

// We Are The Champions (Live) //

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime

And bad mistakesâ
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

// When Love Breaks Up (Demo) //

When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born

There's no waters going down
There's no rain, into the sea
We get lonely, de-de-de
Not at all, de-de-de, oh in the sea

You, there's nothing all else in my hands
Cross the sea, da-da-da
De-de-de

// You Are The Champions //

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

You are the champions, my friends
And you'll keep on fighting 'til the end
You are the champions
You are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause you are the champions of the world

// You Know You Belong To Me //

Please don't go
Stay, though it hurts you I know
In the moonlight bright and the shadows cold
You know you belong to me

I see your face
Your love seems a lifetime away
The shadows come and the shadows go
You know you belong to me

When the night falls
When the tears come
When the pain makes you afraid
Let the wind blow
Let the clouds come
Let the rain wash it away

For love is strange
It goes through every passing little change
When the crying's done and the shadows go
You know you belong to me

In the moonlight bright and the shadows cold
Know I belong to you
