// Dancer //

I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on, baby, you gotta know why

Ha, take off!
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me? Cool

You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries

Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what I say

Dancer, dancer
Can't live with it I'm gonna die without it

// Back Chat //

Mmm, yeah
Ha!

Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat, Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

Oh yeah, see what you've done to me

Backchat, Backchat, you're driving me insane
It's a battle to the end, knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back, you've got me on the rack
Twisting every word I say, you wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever gonna win, have to get the last word in
Take it from there, twisting every word I say
Huh, wind me up and let me play

Back chat (oh yeah), Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat (hey), Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat (yeah), Back chat, and you always get your way

Wake up, stand up and drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready, scream and shout
Back off, be cool, and learn to change your ways
'Cause you're talking in your sleep and you're walking in a daze
Don't push your luck with me, I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm tryna talk to you all you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't frighten me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
Just leave me alone
Hey

Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

Yes, you do, ah
Yes, you do, baby, c'mon!
Back chat, Back chat
Back chat, Back chat (C'mon)
Back chat, Back chat (Hit me!)
Back chat, Back chat (Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Baby)
Back chat, Back chat
Back chat, Back chat

// Action This Day //

Action

This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling, this world is using me

This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me

Action this day
Action this night
Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, we've got to learn to learn to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

Action (hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
Action this day
Action this day (this day, yeah)
Action action this day
Action this day
Living in the street
Living in the street
Living in the street

// Put Out The Fire //

They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
And I had to make him pay

You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out, baby, it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Oh, you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said

She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution is right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead

I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire, baby, put out the fire
And let your sons and your daughters sleep sound in their beds

You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns

Put out the fire put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Just tell me that old-fashioned gun law is dead

Take it and fire
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot

// Life Is Real (Song For Lennon) //

Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah

Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it I will cash it
I can take it or leave it

Loneliness is my hiding place
Breast-feeding myself
What more can I say?
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it

Life is real, life is real
Life is real

Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore

Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real
Life is cruel, life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real, life is real yeah
Life is real

// Calling All Girls //

// Las Palabras De Amor (The Words Of Love) //

Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell Darling
Now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me
The special promises I want to hear

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently

One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through
The never-ending cold
And all for fear and all for greed
Speak any tongue
But for God's sake we need

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore

This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live
We'll meet again
So then my love
We may whisper once more
It's you I adore

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Touch me now
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore
For evermore
For evermore

// Cool Cat //

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, uh-huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart

Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah

Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Woo-ooh
Feelin', feelin', feelin' it, honey
Feeling

// Under Pressure //

Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure: pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da

That's OK

That's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"

Tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
OK

Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days: it never rains but it pours

Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap

People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"

Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high!
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn

Why, why, why!?

Love, love, love, love, love

Insanity laughs under pressure
We're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
