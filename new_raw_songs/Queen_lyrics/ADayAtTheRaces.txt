// Tie Your Mother Down //

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin', baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe

Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

"You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties
In fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys

But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Sniping and grousing going on all night

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's alright)
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Bad guy

Your mommy and your daddy gonna
Plague me 'til I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace-lovin' guy

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

All your love tonight

Give me every inch of your love

All your love tonight, yeah
Gotta get my timing right
All your love

Tonight

// You Take My Breath Away //

Ooh
Ooh, take it, take it all away
Ooh
Ooh, take my breath away (ooh)
Ooh
Ooh, you-ou-ou-ou
Take my breath away

Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
'Til I find you (get no sleep)
And tell you that you just
Take my breath away

I will find you anywhere you go (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep 'til I find you (get no sleep)
To tell you when I've found you
I love you

Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away

// Long Away //

You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long, long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry, put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long, long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day

// The Millionaire Waltz //

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you

I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid?
How we wish that we could stay there forever and ever

Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me

Oh, come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love
Won't you come back to me

My fine friend, take me with you and love me forever
My fine friend, forever, forever

Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you

Come back, come back to me, make me feel

Make me feel like a millionaire

// You And I //

Ooh-ooh

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny
And bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
'Cause then we'll be
Waiting for the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

Ooh, you know I never could
Foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know
Don't know

No, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's gonna
Be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow
Will be as happy
As we're feeling tonight

We'll go walking
In the moonlight (Oh, we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Ooh, just you and I

Mm, just you and I
Can't you see that
We gotta be together, be together
Just you and I, just you and I
No more questions, just you and I

// Somebody To Love //

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me? (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah

I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day) I take home (takes home)
My hard-earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)

I go down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody (somebody), somebody (please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(he works hard) everyday (everyday)
I try, and I try, and I try

But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense (he's got)
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, Lord
Somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!

(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love)
Find
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love, love, love)
Find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
(Somebody find me, somebody find me somebody to love)

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, somebody, somebody
(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody, somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love)
Ooh, somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Anybody, anywhere, anybody, find me somebody to love
Love, love, love, love
Find me, find me, find me, yeah

// White Man //

I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

We made us our shoes
We trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah

White man, white man
Don't you see the light
Behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away the sights
To blind my simple eyes, yeah
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

Oh, the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race
Oh yeah

White man, white man
Our country was green
And all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun
And soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light
For the blood you've shed?

Ooh yeah

Oh-uh-oh
(White man, white man)
White man
(White man, white man)
Ooh, white man
You fought your battle with lies, yeah
(White man, white man)
On and on, on and on
But we weren't too civilized, yeah
(White man, white man)
Look around you
Take a look around
Every skin and bone
Yeah, I'll getcha, I'll getcha, yeah

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah

// Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy //

I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be a Valentino just for you

"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey, boy!"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all

I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey, boy!"
Write my letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you, think of you always
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
I miss you
When I'm not with you, think of me always
Love you, love you

Hey, boy, where do you get it from?
Hey, boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned
School of lover boys

Dining at The Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (come on and get it)

Ooh love (there he goes again)
(He's my good old fashioned lover boy) ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey, boy!
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) lover boy

// Drowse //

It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall than we did in the school hall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small-town boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinking it right, doing it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives
Wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for
Breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix, he was good
William The Conqueror
Now, who else do I like?
Brian May

// Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together) //

When I'm gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone

Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows, the blossom knows
There's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

Teo Torriatte konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

Hear my song
Still, think of me the way
You've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on

Teo Torriatte konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
