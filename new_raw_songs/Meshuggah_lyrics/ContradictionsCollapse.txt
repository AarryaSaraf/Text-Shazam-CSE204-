// Paralyzing Ignorance //

Hear the mourners
The earth is gasping for air
Sneering at this thoughtless ravage
If we don't wake we'll massacre ourselves

Sneaking skullduggery
Slaughter the lungs of humanity
Spreading devastation through this world
a price we never can pay

Dethrone the impassive governments. No more of this
DUPERY
Pollution of environment
STOP THIS NOW
Before it's too late

Mouldering world
you're dying slowly piece by piece
All the riches you've created
will soon be laid destroyed

Dethrone the impassive governments. No more of this
DUPERY
Pollution of environment
STOP THIS NOW
Before it's too late

People
OBEY YOUR EYES
We can't repair when it's all destroyed
no way
DUPERY
Approaching death
TOMORROW FALLS
Why?

People
OBEY YOUR EYES
We can't repair when it's all destroyed
no way
DUPERY
Approaching death
TOMORROW FALLS
Why?

Paralysed by ignorance
The cemetery plans continue
A tremendous trepidation
Perfidious annihilation-all in vain

// Erroneous Manipulation //

An inwrought irksome rabbit
is washing my stomach
I can't stop thinking about my tonsils
how they are pendulating between my toes
slowly suffering from liberty
I'm naked on a TV-set and it's running wild,
fast, sweet and heavy penetrating in to my
grandparents pupils out of reach but with a
canoes evil emotion

Allright I can admit it now
I was a screaming and lying stoneoperation
who searched his way through carparts
afraid to be recognized by a spoon

Birds with empty refridgerators heated up the
childrens chairsweat
There was no chance to drive the table without
a blue sock cause my mistakes rolled down above
the forest of investigation
As soon as I heard my neighbor bend his arm
with a submarine the milk was hot and dangerous
like a bed

Nobody understands how wipewashers can breathe cows
Farting magazines are wading in waxed scarecrows

Falling flesh punched me in my bathsuit look alike neck
which controls universe with an irongrip of umbrellas
I'm wiping away some mirrors from the snakes
without drinking any busstations

Sorry, I'm in love with a door

// Abnegating Cecity //

Your words such unessential lies
Refract my barred up eyes
You all tell me I'm confined
in my "shell of hallucinations"
So try and make me realise
Break my secure enclosure
Just try and I know you'll make me laugh
To hell with your damn comprehension

You belabour me for past and present mishaps
as if I had the might of alteration
You've had your trips into my brain, I know you begrudge
Now let me leave for my amenity

So you see, you whitecoated freak
I don't need your allegations
Instead join me to sanity's end
with my sweet needle of salvation

Increasing needs
OF MY ONLY FRIEND
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
HIDES ME AWAY
Under his soothing crust

MADNESS REIGNS
You're no longer in charge of my alluring illusions
that takes me wherever I want, my
MALNUTRIATED MALICE
rises strong and makes me the ruler of
EARTH, WIND AND FIRE
as reality fades, I'm a king on clouds
The selfpity no longer runs in my veins I'm a
MALEVOLENT REVELATION please let me stay,
GIVE ME MORE

LEFT OUT, Dragged down into emptyness
Drowning in floods of misunderstanding
WHY do you all look aside,
You're ripping my dignity AWAY
Inside identity is leaking out
REALIZATION is catching up on me
My needs bashes false immortality
into my affected being...chaos

Cravings of delight
slowly eats my soul
Trapped within myself
Defraying my own lies
Bewalling my demise
Deep penury...internally

I feel marred by errors, can't you see
my desires are calling for me
The sovereign of abnegations,

swings his feelers for a new relation
Come, mesmerize my oppressive mind
Tear apart these vehement cravings
Give me something to live for, bring me back
from my purgatory of obsessions

Increasing needs
OF MY ONLY FRIEND
The one I trust
He runs in my veins
HIDES ME AWAY
Under his soothing crust

// Internal Evidence //

This could've been a good day
to enjoy how life can be
But instead I wake up in myself
look down ashamed to understand
what we ignore insanity
We wait for the problems
to solve themselves

What the fuck happens here...
NOTHING
Slovenry...
DAMN SAVAGERY
REACT
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes...
DEEPER
Drowning...
BREATHING UNDERWATER-DEATH
HELP...
I wish I felt much better
Feels like I'm dying inside
By murdering this world
we'll all commit...SUICIDE
Search my mind for reasons
to this uncured depression
This void of emptyness prevails

What the fuck happens here
NOTHING
Slovenry...
DAMN SAVAGERY
REACT
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes...
DEEPER
Drowning...
BREATHING UNDERWATER-DEATH
HELP...

WILL SOMEONE HELP ME
You know it yourself, nobody gives a damn
WHY
Because our dreams are left behind
WAKE

Numbed PAIN, I'm NULL, feeling ILL...Internally
Truth GONE, lies HERE, Crushed LIFE...Don't interfere
I'm TRAPPED, Wiped OUT, I'm DEAD...Eternally
Mind CLOSED, Torn SOUL, Life ENDS...I'm dying here...

What am I doing here on this earth. Why am I still awake, has
someone heard. What brought me here to this false humanity,
Why am I bound to this deranged deformity?

I'M DYING HERE

// Qualms Of Reality //

Redundant cruelty
Children are shoveled into enclosed solitude
in lack of value cause by minor defects
Each one an unsuitability
Outside the publics field of vision

Left to die on a bed of concrete
While the rich swallows ostentation
Distorted minds screaming for consolation
The vanity of convenience rules the world

LOCKED UP
Who cares about rights
SO WHAT
If the world's a bit rude
The PROSPEROUS
Pay to keep it concealed
Leaving problems untouched because of fear

ABONDONED LIVES
Hundreds in a room, staring with empty swollen eyes
Mutilated possibilities
Enslaved by INSANITY

The belligerent ARROGANCE of the leaders
strangles the subjecteds RIGHT
to a childhood of safety
NIGHTMARES But for real for ever engraved
in the minds of lost infancies

SHUT OUT
From this dying world of calumny
INFANTICIDE
A thousand souls a day flows away with the breeze

Living corpses, breathing lungs filled with disease
Underdeveloped twisted thoughts, trying to understand
Unfairly secluded by the prevailing injustices
that pushes this mentally ill world
over the edge of acceptance

LOCKED UP
Who cares about rights
SO WHAT
If the world's a bit rude
The PROSPEROUS
Pay to keep it concealed
Leaving problems untouched because of fear

DEATH INSIDE, WITHOUT REACH-THEIR FREEDOM. BOUND TO FEEL, WITHIN-
ILLNESS FLOATING. SOULS IN PENURY, SOON TO FADE OUT-AGGRAVATION IN
CHARGE...BEMOAN OPPRESSION, EXTENSIVE CARNAGE BEHIND WALLS OF
UNCERTAINTY, WE'LL REALISE AS THE FLOODS OF INSIGHT COME DOWN

// We'll Never See The Day //

Justice runed by eternal travesty
Bloodcurdling hammer soon to be released
Stalking brutality tomorrow we will see
the unjustified agony unleashed

Strangling superstitious braces
Rampage overboard
Remoted deathmasks have no faces
We only see the cord

Lead to pathes and alleys
chosened by a treacherous source
Squeeze the odds down to our last days
to summon up their force

Folded to pernicious chambers
pounded by the walls Disappear noone remembers
Nobody hear our calls

Ruthless saints prey upon us
the society of friends
They are the wounds we are the pus
no matter how I ends

Maimed and left to putrefy
betrayed by society
Indiscreet left to die
filled with indignity

We will come to grief
by this irrational democracy
What's a life worth for humanity
Nothing more than justice by insanity

Utilization, covetousness
a voracious mouth to feed
fatal greed engraves our death
chokes our possibilities

We are the children of this devastating science
We are the lost till the end
We are the victims who knows who is lying
forgotten we are dying

WE ARE DYING

WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY
WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY
WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY
WE'LL NEVER SEE THE DAY

// Greed //

Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain
A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society
crushed by our own alternatives we've got ourselves to blame

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind

The reignes rain of pollution melts our opportunities
conjectural in their comfortable lives
Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass
We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind why?

NOW IT'S TIME TO SAVE US

NATURES DEMISE
We can't control our accessies spreading
pollution we fumble till the end
THE END

The water is filled with toxic waste
and the air is filled with shit to breathe
Soon a dismembered world we'll see
WE ARE IN DEEP SHIT

We have to change this world
START TO COMMUNICATE
We can't go on like this no
NO

...and all this because of greed

Now it's time to perceive our inauspicious oversight
We're leaning on death against compensation
Are we so afraid to lose our welfaresociety
that we have to sacrifice ourselves, the earth

Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
WE OBLITERATE OURSELVES
Procrastinated measrues decreases our chance to save
'cause you've always got something else in mind why?

// Choirs Of Devastation //

Melting hands, as in fear they've ruled
but will not anymore
Determination now only a coagulating fluid
burning its pathes down the sad soil

Clouds pregnant with heavy rain
opens up its portals and pour upon earth,
the moist of a lost childhoods
embrace as it boil.

Believe-as you see-the anticipation
lost in mourning choirs of devastation
The aimless glow, we thought would never cease
now groan out its renunciation.

Toxic airwaves throwing their corrosion,
like patternless meshes over consumed ground.
Earth, blindly-stretch out her maimed arms,
only to receive the certainty-there's no help to be found

No one's to blame as streams of equality washes away,
the last traces of humanity's existence.
We just sat, like contented denials as abnegation
took its toll in exterminations' enhance.

We claimed, the dead would open the eyes of the living,
but who's left to exclaim the words-we were right.
Memories of anguish lie as whisper in the heat
Only bareness observe the last remains float out of sight.

// Cadaverous Mastication //

Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are all bound to fall

Mortality
we see today, defrauds our dreams
Approachable to die
Sliced by their lies, secured morbidity

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall

How many of the judges place a bet on me?
What's there to be?
MORIBUND IRREVERENCE
What's there for us in this deranged society?
Inanity
CADAVEROUS MASTICATION

SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday
SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday

YOU ARE INSANE
How can you let there be such cruelty
YOU ARE INSANE
Now it's time for you to see

Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates

Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall

We are bound to fall
