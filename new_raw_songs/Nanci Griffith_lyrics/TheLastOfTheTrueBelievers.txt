Album: TheLastOfTheTrueBelievers

// The Last Of The True Believers //

Oh, he said it was the sound of the winter callin'
From up around the bend
Or it could be the cry of your restless heart
For the love of your long lost friends
Me, I think it's just the summertime and the heat of these Texas winds
They keep on slappin' my face with dust so thick
That the tears won't roll again

Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again... home again... home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again... home again... home

Oh, he said, "you can't stay away forever
'Cause they say love doesn't last that long
And the ghost of the one that you loved the best is bound to be long gone
So you fall for the one you believe in and take pride in the heart you hold
'Cause when the wintertime pounds upon your door
It's shelter from the cold"

Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again... home again... home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again... home again... home

There's a shadow on our wall where I once stood with him in mind
And there is an empty space beside him
Where I do take my rest at night
Oh, I will be the last of the true believers... if truth is his heart to lend
'Cause the wintertime sure looks cold to me... comin' up around the bend

Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again... home again... home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again... home again... home

Oh, I could go home again... home again... home
Well, it looks like home again... home again... home
Oh, I could go home again... home again... home
Well, he brings me home again... home again... home

// Love At The Five And Dime //

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine
And Eddie was a sweet romancer and darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
And they'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Eddie played the steel guitar and his momma cried 'cause he played in the bars
And he kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene, lost a child in Tennessee
But still that love survived

'Cause they'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hand
So Eddie ran off with the bass-man's wife
Oh, but he was back by June singin' a different tune
And sporting Miss Rita back by his side
And He'd sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Eddie traveled with the bar room band till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
And Rita's got her house to keep; she writes dime store novels of love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night
And still sing

Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time and love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine
And Eddie was a sweet romancer and darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
And they'd sing

// St. Olav's Gate //

Drinking black market vodka in the back of the Scottsman's saloon
Then it's red meat and whiskey like a coyote drunk on the moon
Outside in Oslo the buskers' all sing the same tune
And it's Waltzin' Matilda while the bagpipes play old Clare de Lune

She was a lady, she came down from Bergen she said
She spoke little English, they laughed and drank whiskey instead
In the mornin' he found it... a rose with a note on his plate
It said, "meet me at midnight on the corner of St. Olav's Gate"

Here's to the ladys you love and don't see again
The night is warm whiskey... the mornin's a cold bitter wind
The blue eyed Madonna leaves town while the drunken man waits
Leaves him standing alone in the shadows of St. Olav's Gate

Here's to the ladys you love and don't see again
The night is warm whiskey... the mornin's a cold bitter wind
The blue eyed Madonna leaves town while the drunken man waits
Leaves him standing alone in the shadows of St. Olav's Gate

// More Than A Whisper //

How I wish that you would call... we have not spoken since last fall
Now that smokey conversation's come and gone
Do I just read between your lines?
Or could it be this winter wine?... so sweet upon my tongue tonight
Recalls your tender eyes

O, I need more than a whisper... so much more than a whisper
It takes more than a whisper to wake this weary fool
Give me more than a whisper... if you're sayin' I love you
'Cause it's the whispers I have never understood

It's snowin' up in the northlands... I read your warm words from the plains
While the poets say that I should never be thinkin' of you this way
They say that I misread your lines 'cause I've been lonely all my life
And here I'm reachin' for some silver and leavin' my heart out in the fire

O, I need more than a whisper... so much more than a whisper
It takes more than a whisper to wake this weary fool
Give me more than a whisper... if you're sayin' I love you
'Cause it's the whispers I have never understood

I will drink my winter wine... when I get home I'll change my mind
I'll only whisper that I love you in those smokey bars at night
And though the poets say I'm lonely... there's still this woman here inside
And I've never been a fool when my heart was on the line

O, I need more than a whisper... so much more than a whisper
It takes more than a whisper to wake this weary fool
Give me more than a whisper... if you're sayin' I love you
'Cause it's the whispers I have never understood

// Banks Of The Pontchartrain //

I'm goin' back where my garden blooms all year
Where the wintertime speaks softly in the fallin' rain
I'm goin' back to my green eyed lover there
And we will dance along the banks of old Lake Pontchartrain

Oh, I've grown pale beneath the streets of Montreal
Where the voices ring like bells in French-Canadian
And the rivers stand imprisoned till the thaws
I am alone at night and dream of my own Pontchartrain

Take me to the station... I am late to catch my southbound train
Oh, I'm gonna call my cousin Libby
She will be waiting by the tracks when I roll in
I'm gonna roll across America
Just to stand beside my Pontchartrain again

These old rails shake like thunder through the night
Soon I'll have my green eyed lover's arms to comfort me
Oh, I can see my cousin Libby by his side
Her hair will flow in waves like on Lake Pontchartrain

I'm goin' back where my garden blooms all year
Where the wintertime speaks softly in the fallin' rain
I'm goin' back to my green eyed lover there
And we will dance along the banks of old Lake Pontchartrain
Yes, we will dance along the banks of old Lake Pontchartrain
We will dance along the banks of old Lake Pontchartrain
And here comes the train

// Lookin' For The Time (Workin' Girl) //

Well, I work this corner from eleven to five
The hands get cold around midnight
You're askin' me if I've got the time, well I don't know
But you're wastin' mine tonight

Whoa, you say you're looking for the time
Well, I'm a workin' girl, you just wasted mine
If you ain't got money, take it down the avenue
'Cause I ain't got time for you until daylight

This sidewalk ice is cold as steel
I'm not Dorothy, I can't click my heels
One of these days I'll move to L.A
Where the nights stay warm and the boys come out to play

Whoa, you say you're looking for the time
Well, I'm a workin' girl, you just wasted mine
If you ain't got money, take it down the avenue
'Cause I ain't got time for you until daylight

Don't the snow light up the midnight sky
The snow plows roll and the limos fly
Don't cha know it's just another night

Oh, once I had a lover who treated me right
He lived so wrong he's doin' ninety-nine
Oh, I wish you had the money and I had the time
'Cause I'd just let those limos slide on by

Whoa, you say you're looking for the time
Well, I'm a workin' girl, you just wasted mine
If you ain't got money, take it down the avenue
'Cause I ain't got time for you until daylight

Whoa, you say you're looking for the time
Well, I'm a workin' girl, you just wasted mine
If you ain't got money, take it down the avenue
'Cause I ain't got time for you until daylight

// Goin' Gone //

There's a lighthouse in the harbor
Giving guidance with it's light
But, I had no one to return to
As I wandered through the night

From the first time that I saw you
Standing silent by the shore
I knew my search was over
And I would look for love no more

Deep in the waters of love I am falling
Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love callin'
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone

There's a ship on the horizon
Makin' it's way against the wind
From the place where I stand watching
I swear my ship is coming in

Deep in the waters of love I am falling
Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love callin'
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone

Deep in the waters of love I am falling
Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love callin'
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin' gone

Deep in the waters of love I am falling
Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love callin'
Goin' once...

// Love's Found A Shoulder //

My friends think I'm crazy and maybe it's true
'Cause I'll go on and love you this way
Though I have discovered that you love another
And hardly remember my name

My youth was so crazy, my heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill

I wish you well for your new love
'Cause true love is so hard to hold
You'll be the one that I dream of
Till I find a love of my own

Now, here I am standin' in the cold winter rain
If hearts were of wool I'd be warm
I've known some kind hearts and I've touched a few
Though I never claim one for my own

My youth was so crazy, my heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill

// Fly By Night //

Oh, its just another summer mornin', baby, somewhere in this town
The heat is rising
Oh, I know where you spent last night so you can stop apologizing
You say that you've been out... just lookin' around this town
I don't wanna know just exactly what you've found
Because tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'

Don't they fly by night
Yeah tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'

I'll be standin' on the corner watchin' the men folk go by
I don't wanna touch 'em honey, I'll look them in the eye
And say, "Tonight I am out on these streets to watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin"

Oh, I never put a chain upon your heart or tried to make you walk the
Line for me
Only a fool would want a heart that needs a chain to keep it restin'
Here beside of me
You say you wished I cared what you did with your time
But what's your time is yours and tonight is gonna be mine
And I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'

I'm comin' out of your pocket and into my own
I'm gonna have a stonger heart when I round the bend for home
Now I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
I'll be standin' on the corner watchin' the men folk go by
I don't wanna touch 'em honey, I'll look them in the eye
And say, "Tonight I am out on these streets to watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin"
Oh, they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight to watch the lonely hearts go flyin'

// The Wing And The Wheel //

The wing and the wheel, they carry things away
Whether it's me that does the leavin' or the love that flies away
The moon outside my window looks so lonely tonight
Oh, there's a chunk out of it's middle, big enough for an old fool to hide

Where are all the dreamers that I used know?
We used to linger beneath street lamps in the halos and the smoke
The wing and the wheel, came to carry them away
Now they all live out in the suburbs where their dreams
Are in their children at play

There's a pale sky in the east, all the stars are in the west
Oh, here's to all the dreamers, may our open hearts find rest
The wing and the wheel are gonna carry us along
And we'll have memories for company, long after the songs are gone
