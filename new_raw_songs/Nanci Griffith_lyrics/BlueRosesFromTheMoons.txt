// Gulf Coast Highway //

Gulf Coast Highway, he worked the rails
He worked the rice fields with their cool dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing we've ever owned is this old house here by the road

And when he dies, he says, he'll catch some blackbird's wing
And he will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

She walked through springtime when I was home
The days were sweet, the nights were warm
The seasons changed, the jobs would come the flowers fade
This old house felt so alone when the work took me away

And when she dies, she says, she'll catch some blackbird's wing
And she will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

Highway 90, the jobs are gone
We tend our garden, we set the sun
This is the only place on earth bluebonnets grow
Once a year they come and go at this old house here by the road

And when we die, we say, we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

And when we die, we say, we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away together, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

// Everything's Comin' Up Roses //

This life is filled with wonder
This life is full of days not spent
Oh I cannot help but ponder
What relevance that lends

Oh, but everything is comin' up roses
And when I'm pushing daisies...
They'll want roses anyway
Oh, and everything's comin' up roses
It's comin' up roses every day

I've got a heart bent on confusion
I'm punch drunk straight half the time
I'm feeling watered down and diluted
Still the weather's holdin' fine

Oh, but everything is comin' up roses
And when I'm pushing daisies...
They'll want roses anyway
Oh, and everything's comin' up roses
It's comin' up roses every day

There's a piece of land in Kentucky
My grandfather worked one long hot day
Now it's a flatland blacktop strip mall
Still, I remember what he'd say

Oh, but everything is comin' up roses
And when I'm pushing daisies...
They'll want roses anyway
Oh, and everything's comin' up roses
It's comin' up roses every day

Everyday... everyday... buy the dozen... everyday

// Two For The Road //

Out of the blue horizon
Stretched a band of gold
From the straits of Juan de Fuca
To the east of Portland, Maine
You held my hand
As we raced along the buffalo bayou
Chasing the tail of this globe
You say one day, babe we're bound to
'Cause it takes two for the road

We're two of a kind heart
Closing in the distances
Now here comes our twilight part
And we've had the best light of our days
We're two rails that never crossed in anger
Voices never raised
Two of a kind heart
Two for the road

We have been blessed with dreaming
You had Georgia's New Mexico
And while your hands worked in China
It was from Ireland I wrote
Moving out from America
From those buffalo bayou trails
Now, didn't you tell me, babe, we'll have this globe
By it's tail
'Cause it takes two for the road

We're two of a kind heart
Closing in the distances
Now here comes our twilight part
And we've had the best light of our days
We're two rails that never crossed in anger
Voices never raised
Two of a kind heart
Two for the road

And we can be anywhere and never leave home
With your hand to hold... we are two for the road
Two of a kind heart... two for the road

// Wouldn't That Be Fine //

If you could stand behind my eyes for just one day
Could you see my heart beside you?
If you knew my love had never flown away
Would I be missing you, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine

If I could wash away all these years with language
Could this naked love survive the light of day
If I could be the one who walked away
Would you be missing me, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?

I saw the weather change high up on the cap rock
It is my sense of place, you were my holiday
If you could hold me now and brace these broken shoulders
Wouldn't that be trust, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?

If I could turn your head with the round of my pen
Leaving all we've said behind us
If I could roll these dice and finally loose my anger
Wouldn't that be love, wouldn't that be roses
Wouldn't that be fine?

// Battlefield //

I live on a battlefield
Surrounded by the ruins of a love we built
And then destroyed between us, the smoke has cleared
As I stumble through the rubble, I'm dazed and seein' double
And I'm truly mystified

My new home is a shell-hole
Filled with tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love being torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

I live on a battlefield
The one where not one single drop of
Blood has spilled
Is no less horrifying, sweet memories
Of a bygone situation
Now shattered, Lord and battered
Lies scattered all around

My new home is a shell-hole
Filled with tears and muddy water
Yes, and bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love being torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

Everything that can and has gone wrong
(I live on a battlefield)
It's gonna take spine to carry on
(I live on a battlefield)
Like a drownin' man comin' up for air
(I live on a battlefield)
I'm looking for another survivor
But I can't see one anywhere

My new home
(My home is filled with muddy water)
All around
(All around, there's bit of broken heart)
My world
(My world)
Is one of desolation, and scenes of devastation
There is no consolation, for a love been torn apart

I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(My home is filled with muddy water)
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(All around, there's bits of broken heart)
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
(My home is filled with muddy water)

// Saint Teresa Of Avila //

Saint Teresa, your patron child's come home
Were you there to greet her?
Did your angels know her songs?
And all her sorrows
Did you lift them from her brow?
Did you kiss her hand that took her soul
Back up to you
Our Patron saint of harmony and vow

Help me in this stillness
Tell me things I need to know
How we loved your patron child
We say, so long and so long ago
Saint Teresa
Can you speak to me at all
Ah, from here where will we go?
Saint Teresa

Saint Teresa, she was our sister of arms
Gone now the trio
To Our Lady, Kate and John
And fare to fare
Of the tears that cannot fall
We send this melody please help her sing along
Back up to you
Our Patron saint of harmony and song

Back up to her Patron saint
Beyond our wood those lights
Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
Back up to her Patron saint
Beyond our wood those lights
Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
Saint Cecilia to Saint Teresa
"Your patron child is home"
(There are lights beyond our woods)

Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites
(Lights)

Saint Teresa of Avila
Discalced de Carmelites

// I Fought The Law //

Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money and I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the lawn won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Robbin' people with a zip gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Left my bay and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

// Not My Way Home //

I know you believe in miracles
That this love will come back around
I know you believe the grass is growing
Across this winter
To the south of this town

I know your kiss is sweeter
Than the dust that this love has become
Yet, I know your path is clearer
Shed of me, out there on your own

I don't intend to sound ungrateful
You've given love when I had none
My feet had tread upon the road you're on
And I know it's not my way home
I know, it's not my way home
I know, it's not my way home

You know, this love has left us
Don't count the years, it took a long time to kill
I know you will find a place for memories
And you'll be out there runnin', I will be here to be still

// Is This All There Is? //

I have traveled far to be sitting here with you
And I will leave this place alone
That's a sad and simple truth
There is so little time and so much to say
And I'll be none the wiser
When I leave you here today

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is

It always stops me cold every time I hear your name
The friends that we have shared
Know I'll never love the same
I still hear your voice echo through the days
Yet it never breaks my stride
'Cause we would always end this way

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is

We were really something
Holding hands and walkin'
Now, no amount of talkin'
Could lend this love a place to go

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is

// Maybe Tomorrow //

I will find somebody new
Maybe tomorrow
I will stop this missing you
Maybe tomorrow
Time's the healer time's the key
So all the wise folks say
Oh, maybe tomorrow
But not today

Life will once again make sense
Maybe tomorrow
I'll regain my confidence
Maybe tomorrow
True love is just around the bend
But I really don't know when
Oh, maybe tomorrow
But not today

There's a gorgeous morning in my future
There are smiles waiting here
Behind the tears
Once again I'll be a friend worth having
And just chalk this off
As one of those years

I will find somebody new
Maybe tomorrow
I will stop this missing you
Maybe tomorrow
Time's the healer time's the key
So all the wise folks say
Oh, maybe tomorrow
But not today

Oh, maybe tomorrow
But not today

// Waiting For Love //

Life is full of finer things
They're lost and found in the dark
It's the dog by the highway
Who said, "Goin' my way?"
Now, he lives in your own backyard
He was waiting for love
You came along and fit the part

It's the whistle from the man
With the kindest hands
And a Norwegian name you can't say
You meet him in the street
Tripping over your own feet
He claims you still anyway
Waiting for love
God forgives your lack of grace

Everyone I know
From my dust bowl to the city
Is waiting for love (love)
To start another day
They may be shy of heart
Oh, their pockets may be empty
Yet they are waiting for love (love)
And that's enough to fill our days

It's the heartworn jokes of your dear father
And the laughter in your own mother's heart
It's that plane blowin' in
With your love one within
Who you've ached for in your time apart
When you're waiting for love
Life's a thread of paths to cross

Whiter shade of pale is my best kept secret
It's the song that'll sail me back home
It's a picture in my hand
Of my own farm land
And the crops that I planted last spring
When you're waiting for love
You've got the finest life can bring

When you're waiting for love (love)
You've got enough to fill your days

// I'll Move Along //

This flesh and bone ain't much protection
For an honest heart like mine
A broken home for good intentions
Damaged inventions of my design

I'll move along (time to move along)
I'll move along (time to move along)

I'm slow to move these feet of clay
You passed me by now you're in my way
I take my change at my own damn pace
I'll move along one day

I'll move along (time to move along) (come on let's go)
I'll move along (time to move along) (come on let's go)

I don't say much I was born to listen
Tell me now, did I hear you wrong?
This was love not the Inquisition
If it was my decision we should move along

You passed me by now you're in my way
I'll move along one day

// Morning Train //

There's a morning train
Headed for New Orleans
Carrying business men and week day shoppers
I have sixteen bucks and a dollar in change
That's not bad price for a one way ride
On a morning train

I give you my devotion
You left me heartsick
Oh, you couldn't had hurt me more
Not workin' with a night stick
Now I'm tired of sharin' this bed of nails
So come first light I'm gonna be right
With the mornin' train

So goodbye lover, I'm goin' undercover
Crescent City's gonna swallow me
Gonna skip my ring 'cross the Mississippi River
When it sinks I won't feel a thing
When it sinks I won't feel a thing

I'm gonna be stayin'
With a short time acquaintance
When I met him he was playin'
On the Gulf Breeze Circuit
He didn't play no hit songs or TV themes
He's a guitar man just a hired hand
From a local band

The whistles blowin' clear and loud

When I hit the station
I'll take a taxi to the corner
I'm gonna meet him by a street car
Name of what-cha-ma-call-it
My imagination
Won't let us miss a thing
Life's gonna be fine when I leave him behind
On a mornin' train

// She Ain't Goin' Nowhere //

She was standin' on the gone side of leavin'
She found her thumb and stuck it in the breeze
She'll take anything that's goin' close to somewhere else
She can lay it down and live it as she please

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She's not sittin' down and crying on her suitcase
She has no second thoughts by the road
She's got feelings that need some repairin'
And she did not give a damn that it showed

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

The wind had a way with her hair
And the blues had a way with her smile
And she had a way of her own
Like prisoners have a way with a file

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She ain't goin' nowhere
She's just leavin'
She ain't goin' nowhere
Se can't breathe in
She ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She ain't goin' home that's for sure
