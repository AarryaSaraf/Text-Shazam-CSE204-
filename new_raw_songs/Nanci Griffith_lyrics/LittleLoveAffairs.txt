// Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool //

You can cuss the daylights outta this pale winter moon
We could ponder every reason why your true love was untrue
You can cry your eyes out 'cause I've got a shoulder here for you
But, everyday your broken heart is gonna turn a lighter shade of blue

Oh, anyone can be somebody's fool
Just look at me, I once was a fool for you
So you know it's true
Anyone can be somebody's fool

Out in this lonely town there is a lovely silver frost
So, we could stop and have another round for this true love you've lost
It's gonna take a little time before your emptiness grows old
But, underneath the silver frost, you've still got a heart of gold

Hey, when this winter's over
You're gonna walk knee deep in clover
You know your heart will 'round the corner
And you're gonna feel brand new

// I Knew Love //

I knew love
When it still meant forever
When a feeling shared didn't always have to hurt
And a promise that was made would go unbroken
I knew love
When it was more than a word

I knew a time
When hope was all you needed
And if you cared you found a way to make things work
When life was what two people shared together
Oh, I knew love
When it was more than a word

I knew love
When I could still believe
It was the greatest power in the world
I knew love
When it was more than just a word

I knew hearts
When they made it all so easy
And sad goodbyes were seldom ever heard
When I wouldn't have to read this note that says you're leaving
I knew love
When it was more than just a word

I knew love when it was more than just a word

// Never Mind //

You say you're heading out to California
You've heard the grapes are falling from the vines
I was hoping you might have the urge to write me
But, I don't believe you will so never mind

I was talkin' to a man down at Genesco
He said they might be hiring anytime
I'm so tired of going anyway the wind blows
And I though that me and you but never mind

Never mind never mind
I'm just talkin' through the wine
And you know that drinkin' always makes me sad
But before this night is through I better say I love you
Or I'm gonna always wish that I had

I first saw you pickin' oranges in Orlando
All day you kept your ladder close to mine
We froze in Georgia burned up in Chicago
And I always thought that we but never mind

Did you know today my baby called you daddy?
Sometimes I've wished that she was yours and mine
I could call my brother Milt in Cincinnati
And ask him for a loan but never mind

// Love Wore A Halo (Back Before The War) //

She owned a hotel on the Jersey shore
She made her living sending sailors door to door
He was the small one with a crooked smile
Oh, he made her eyes light up like the heavens on the fourth of July

She ran the numbers they say she ran 'em clean
Those porcelain hands could keep a ledger even in her sleep
While he worked the Seabees in the Philippines
They say she made more money than you or I will ever see

Love was an anchor on the Jersey shore
If you were looking for love, boys, you could've found it in forty-four
Cause love wore a halo back before the war
When the men loved the women and the women knew what men were for

It was in the winter when he came home
He had to hold those porcelain hands just to keep her warm
So, they had a daughter they named her Stephanie Anne
Hey, they sent her off to Vassar to find herself a family man

Now, she sold the hotel it belongs to me
I watch those sailors come and go like the waves in the seas
I've hung their portraits in the honeymoon suite
I hear they're fishin' their lives away in the Florida Keys

// So Long Ago //

My daddy sent me off to Baton Rouge in nineteen-sixty-nine
He said our love was like a forest fire and he'd end it with the miles
So you rode with us to Temple, Texas where I did catch the train
I remember waving back at you through a silted window pane

I said, "Fare thee well true love of mine"
I said, "Fare thee well, sweet lips of wine"
And you said, "Fare thee well my Texas rose"
And then you blew a kiss of innocence as the train began to roll
So long ago

You'd gone off to fight the war when I returned from school
I traded in my innocence when the springtime came to bloom
I married for my family one night I dreamed of you
And you were running from me in the rain down on Congress Avenue

I saw you once in a crowded bar it was Christmas time
I was frightened by the thunder of our hearts in sixty-nine
Because I live my life in whispers now and I choose to live alone
So I slipped back to the Avenue and flipped my collar to the cold

Where did we go?
That long ago?
So long ago

// Little Love Affairs //

When I wake in the night and find that I'm dreaming
You're the first thought in mind
Love's a fair weather friend when you're lonely
You are my summer state of mind

Does it sing to you nightly?
Does it lay down beside you?
Does it make you hear songs on the radio?
It once was my shadow grown weary of travel
Till you gave it home

What makes the love grow when the seasons change?
What makes the love grow?
It's simple it comes and it grows on it's own

Does it sing to you nightly?
Does it lay down beside you?
Does it make you hear songs on the radio?
It once was my shadow grown weary of travel
Till you gave it home

// I Wish It Would Rain //

Oh, I wish it would rain
And wash my face clean
I want to find some dark cloud to hide in here
Love in a memory
Sparkled like diamonds
When the diamonds fall they burn like tears

Once I had a love from the Georgia pines
Who only cared for me
I wanna find that love of twenty-two
Here at thirty-three
I've got a heart on my right
One on my left neither suits my needs
No, the one I love lives a-way out West
And he never will need me

I'm gonna pack up my two step shoes
And head for the Gulf Coast plains
I wanna walk the streets of my own hometown
Where everybody knows my name
I wanna ride the waves down in Galveston
When the hurricane blow in
'Cause that Gulf Coast water tastes sweet as wine
When your heart's rollin' home in the wind

When the diamonds fall, darlin'
They burn like tears

// Outbound Plane //

I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
Oh, I've been here before
Somehow this doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap
So we could talk all night long
And we may never figure out just where your love went wrong

Cause I don't want to be standing here
Don't want to be talking here
And I don't really care who's to blame
Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say
Love is not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away from love alone
To pace the floor
Young or old
I say that love is still the same
You may walk away from love but you'll fall head and heel again

Two lonely hearts in this airport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But, if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane

That frown you're wearing's
Just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared back in the lost and found?
These broken wings are gonna leave me here to stand my ground
You can have this ticket for that lonely plane that's flying out

// I Would Change My Life //

You never liked this place where we'd been living all along
So, you packed up your things and bought a one-way ticket home
Leaving never hurts as much as being left behind

I would change my life
I would make it right
I would change my life
If you would only change your mind

I have spent many hours on some misbegotten dream
I have spent my money on some foolish hearted things
I have spent my memory on old embittered wine

I wish that I could find the words to make you come back home
I wish that I could say the things you needed for so long
I wish that you could see me, maybe then you'll find
...

// Sweet Dreams Will Come //

I'm sleepin' less in L.A.
Dreamin' of days yet to come
Oh, and I don't care what you say
I know that those days will surely come
I'm wakin' and I'm callin'
I'm shakin' and I'm fallin'
Oh, little darlin'
I wonder when those sweet dreams will come

There's a hole in the sky
Made by my Right Guard last night
Oh, and then there's you and I
Assuring that everything's alright
We are nursing, pretending
Cursing then defending
And yet, it's never ending
Make ya wonder when those sweet dreams will come

Lookin' for some love
I guess that why people buy dogs
Is there someone up above?
And I wonder is the Captain keeping logs
I am cursing and I'm praying
Not knowin' what we're saying
And yet, it's everydaying
And I wonder when those sweet dreams will come

I feel like a fire
In the morning when the fire is out
I am walking on the wire
And the wire's what the whole thing is about
The pretender is thinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's a beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come

The pretender is thinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come

Oh, little darlin'
Don't cha wonder when those sweet dreams will come

(Oh, sweet dreams will come)
