// 1937 Pre-War Kimball //

Oh, it sat in this corner for many a year
Through fireside parties, of tears and cheers
The hands of James Hooker flew over its keys
And God know who who else 'fore it came to me
When I was alone I could be Julie Gold
It rang her "From A Distance" just like it was my own
I'd pretend I've the voice of Beth Nielsen Chapman
I wrote "Late Night Grande (Hotel)"
With just my right hand happenin'

Now its keys rent the air in its new place to stand
A gift for the children who'll play right and left hand
Just a 1937 pre-war Kimball
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand

Oh, it's lonesome in this corner at five am
I'd called Harlan Howard, only he'd understand
All of those melodies that came to be
Mornings in that corner that piano and me
I wish for a left hand like Glen D. Hardin
I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children
Is all this Kimball needs

I've let it go, let it go
That piano I bought from Al Jones long ago
I've let it go, I've let it go
I smiled as it rolled out the door
The songs that we wrote, ah, not for note
That piano will always know

And God bless the child
Who's got a song
Who's got a song
Who's got a song

// Cradle Of The Interstate //

It's crystal breaking in the light of day
It's the heat of the moon that's gone it's way
And everybody's packing their wings to fly home
Leaving me here
In the cradle of the interstate alone

Fair weather friends are a damn disease
They drink my wine and take my money
Fools are reaching for a dim spotlight shine
If you want that shine
You're gonna have to write your own damn lines

It turns a warm heart cold
Hey, clear this road
Let me by

I got fog in the foothills of Tennessee
It's the Catskill mountains
And the Blue Ridge behind me
Topping my list of all I need
It's a warm cup of coffee
And a bottle of whiskey beside me

I worked so hard to build this living
In a business of hard lines
Where nobody's sharing
Fools chase their tails
For that Top 40 flight
Now the only friend that holds me
Is the cradle of the interstate

It turns a warm heart cold
Hey, clear this road
Let me by

It's crystal breaking in the light of day
It's the heat of the moon
Who's gone his way
And everybody's packing their wings to fly home
Leaving me here in the cradle of the interstate, alone

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home

Lullaby...
Roll me gently in this cradle of the interstate home

// Deadwood, South Dakota //

Well, the good times scratched a laugh
From the lungs of the young men
In a Deadwood saloon, South Dakota afternoon
And the old ones by the door
With their heads on their chests
They told lies about whiskey on a woman's breath

Yes, and some tell the story of young Mickey Free
Who lost an eye to a buck deer in the Tongue River Valley
Oh and some tell the story of California Joe
Who sent word through the Black Hills
There was a mountain of gold

And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in
Where the white man does as he pleases

Some flat-shoed fool from the East comes a-runnin'
With some news that he'd read in some St. Joseph paper
And it was "Drinks all around" cause the news he was tellin'
Was the one they called Crazy
Has been caught and been dealt with

And the Easterner he read the news from the paper
And the old ones moved closer so's they could hear better
"Well, it says here that Crazy Horse
Was killed while trying to escape
And that was some time last September
It don't give the exact date"

And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in
Where the white man does as he pleases

Where the white man does as he pleases

Then the talk turned back to whiskey and women
And cold nights on the plains, Lord
And fightin' them Indians
And the Easterner he says he'll have one more
'Fore he goes
He gives the paper to the Crow boy
Who sweeps up the floor

And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in
Where the white man does as he pleases

Where the white man does as he pleases
Where the white man does as he pleases
As he wants to, as he pleases
