// I Don't Wanna Talk About Love //

I don't wanna talk about love
'Cause I've heard it before
And it talks too loud
You can hear it in a disco midnight
Shouting
I don't wanna think about it
Think about it
It comes dressed in its summer clothes
When you're traveling through the heart of the winter's cold

I don't wanna talk about changes
Changes come of their own free will
And if you wanna talk about leavin'
Well, you've always walked
And, you always will
Everytime you talk about love
You talk about your yesterdays
Yesterday's washing away with this morning's rain

I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause love has a voice of its own
If all we do is try to out shout it
Then the love is gone

I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now

Can't you hear the voice in my heart
It calls your name in the middle of the night
It's always been a quiet voice when it's breaking
I don't wanna talk about this love
This love was my saving grace
So, can't I just say that I love you
And we'll call it a day?

// Drive-In Movies And Dashboard Lights //

Sister had a crystal voice
She played a Silvertone from Montgomery Ward
Baez songs in Monroe hair
She sure could turn the boys' heads to stare
Swim wear saunter, tan and haunt them
Was all she learned in school
Books were for the other girls
And the other girls were fools
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

Father waltzed her down the aisle
'Cause college didn't suit her style
The sad truth was she could barely read
If you told dear Father
Well, he wouldn't believe you
The telephone rang it drove Mother insane
From the hearts left on the shelf
Sister's gone and she won't be home
'Cause she didn't take care of herself
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

Where is she now?
The backseat queen of fraternity
Where is she now?
She is heavy of thigh and light on integrity
Someone should've told her
When beauty's all you offer
How soon the world discovers that your beauty's gone
(It's gone)

Mother can't you hear your daughter crying
Father wake up her youth is dying
Her kids are grown, husband's gone away
And it's a shame 'cause she had such a lovely face
Can't you see she needed more
Than, "Oh what a pretty child"?
You never taught her truth from lie
All you told her was to smile
In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

In Texas back in sixty-nine
It was drive-in movies and dashboard lights

// You Made This Love A Teardrop //

What've you got to say for yourself, now baby
Now that I am leaving you
What have you got to lose?
The truth you tried to keep from me
Well, it nearly drove me crazy
And I have grown weary
From sleepless nights of you
Is that a broken heart in the corner of your eye?
Something to remind you?

You made this love a teardrop
Ready to fall
There are those who can't love right
I just can't love wrong
When you are lonely in the night
How I hope you will recall
You made this love a teardrop
Waiting to fall

No, I will not forgive you for betraying trust between us
Though I will always care for you
I've loved you half my life
And when I give my heart again
I know that I'll remember
Love is but a fragile flame
And trust just fuels the fire
When I think of all the years your love has taken from me
I can't believe I'm leaving you
...

// Storms //

As quiet as a street lamp
This is some kinda town
Whiskey go easy
When the sun goes down
My best to the midnight
God, look at the moon
There's enough for two shadows
There's only one in the room
There's only one in the room

There's a storm out on the water
Oh, bless the ships at sea
There's a storm down in my lover's heart
Oh, God bless me

I wanna be blown by the wind of his
Breathing
Shown by lightening flashing
Oh, I've never been afraid of the thunder
I wonder
Will he rain on me?
Is loneliness contagious?
Another damn song about a waitress
It's the only hotel here
And the engine's gotta cool
I'm a bad hand at solitaire
You lie to yourself and no one cares
While the wall paper fades
The sun takes the moon
There should be two to a room

There's a storm out on the water
Oh, bless the ships at sea
There's a storm down in my lover's heart
Oh, God bless me

// It's A Hard Life Wherever You Go //

I am a backseat driver from America
They drive to the left on Falls Road
The man at the wheel's name is Seamus
We pass a child on the corner he knows
And Seamus says, "Now, what chance has that kid got?"
And I say from the back, "I don't know"
He says, "There's barbed wire at all of these exits
And there ain't no place in Belfast for that kid to go"

It's a hard life
It's a hard life
It's a very hard life
It's a hard life wherever you go
If we poison our children with hatred
Then, the hard life is all they'll ever know
And there ain't no place in (Belfast) for these kids to go
(Chicago)
(This world)

A cafeteria line in Chicago
The fat man in front of me
Is calling black people trash to his children
He's the only trash here I see
And I'm thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But, they slip to their window and they see him
And they think that white hood's all they need

I was a child in the sixties
Dreams could be held through TV
With Disney and Cronkite and Martibn Luther
Oh, I believed, I believed, I believed
Now, I am a backstreet driver from America
I am not at the wheel of control
I am guilty, I am war I am the root of all evil
Lord, and I can't drive on the left side of the road

// If Wishes Were Changes //

I wish that you loved me
The way that I love you
I wish I had Angels
Who sang in my dreams
If wishes were changes
We'd all live in roses
And there wouldn't be children
Who cried in their sleep

He wishes I loved him
The way that I love you
If wishes were changes
I'd dry all his tears
If wishes were changes
I'd make him my anchor
He'd be my anchor
He'd be my Angel
Who sang through the years

So long to the blue days of wishing
If wishes were changes
There'd be no goodbyes
So long to the heart I have given
'Cause wishing won't bring back
The love in your eyes

I wish that I had your
Wings of desire
I wish I had seen you
As I see you now
I wouldn't feel sorrow
You've left here inside me
But, wishing won't change
Right from wrong for you now
...

// Listen To The Radio //

I am leaving Mississippi in the evening rain
These Delta towns wear satin gowns in a high beamed frame
Loretta Lynn guides my hands through the radio
Where would I be in times like these without the songs Loretta wrote?

When you can't find a friend you've still got the radio
When you can't find a friend you've still got the radio
Radio listen to the radio
Radio listen to the radio

I left a handsome two stepped good ole boy in Tennessee
Now, he's sittin'n on the sofa, lookin' for his supper, wonderin' what's become of me
I've got a double-o-eighteen Martin guitar in the backseat of the car
Hey, I am leaving Mississippi with the radio on

There's a moon across the border in the Louisiana sky
I smell the Pontchartrain, I hear Silver Wings then, away Merle Haggard Flies
That good ole boy will find a Band of Gold on the stereo
Hey, then my Mama's gonna call and say, "Where's she gone?"
He'll say, "Down the road with the radio on"

// Leaving The Harbor //

When you are leaving the harbor
Do you cry out to the shore?
Do you bless the wave of the ocean
Do you call your vessel home?

As you leave the safest harbor
Do you wonder where you'll go?
When you feel your bough is breaking
Do you call that harbor home?

When you sing the lullaby
Do you sing it for the song?
Or do you love the way it slides
Like velvet 'cross your tongue?

And as you sing the lullaby
Do you savor every line?
Or do they flow as one with your heartbeat
With your voice and your mind?

If you turn the light out in the hallway
Will your shadow lose its way?
Or do we share these shadows in the darkness
And they move from place to place?

We could share a shadow in the darkness
As shadows have no face
But should you sell our soul to the darkness
Can you face the light of the day?

When you are leaving the harbor
Do you cry out to the shore?
Oh, do you bless the wave of the ocean?
Do you call your vessel home?
Oh, do you bless the wave of the ocean?
Do you call your vessel home?

// Radio Fragile //

We all said you'd never make it
'Cause you had that fragile heart
And you were odd within the ways of the social
You through a caution to us all
And now when the late night drinkers gather for their falls
Someone says they've seen you out there laughing at us all

You mourned the cause of discontent with those who couldn't lose the dark
From the broad of daylight to half spent stars just waiting dusk to fall
Tell me, what the hell were you saying?
Was there a point at to it all?
Oh, and did they really see you out there laughing at us all

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Oh, were you really out there laughing at us all?

The midnight boy from Minnesota shut you down and stole the show
They say that you bitter in your anguish
'Cause it was you they ought to hold
You wore your causes on your sleeve like a beacon wears the dark
It's only right you should be out there laughing at us all

Now you are only dust for art
You're a shadow to recall
For all those late night drinkers in their ragged lonely bars
And we all said you'd never make it 'cause you had that fragile heart
Now, all our hearts you held are wasted
You're out there laughing at us all
...
