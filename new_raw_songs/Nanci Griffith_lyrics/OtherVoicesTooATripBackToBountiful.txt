// Wall Of Death //

Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
But this is the nearest to being alive
Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you
But let me take my chances on the wall of death

On the wall of death
All the world is far from me
On the wall of death
It's the nearest to being free

You're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong
But what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death

Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
But this is the nearest to being alive
Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death
Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death
Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death

// Who Knows Where The Time Goes //

Across the evening sky
All the birds are leaving
But how can they know
It's time for them to go
Before the winter fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

Sad deserted shore
Your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know
It's time for them to go
I will still be here
I have not thought of leaving
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

And I am not alone
While my love is near me
I know it will be so
Until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time
For who knows how my love grows
And who knows where the time goes

// You Were On My Mind //

When I got up this morning
You were on my mind
You were on my mind

I got some aches and
I got some pains and
I got some wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
Just to ease my pain

I got drunk and
I got sick and
I came home again

Well I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind

I got troubles
I got worries
I got wounds to bind
I got a feeling down in my shoes
Way down in my shoes
I got to move on
I got to travel
I got to walk away my blues

When I got up this morning
You were on my mind
You were on my mind
I got some aches and
I got some pains and
I got some wounds to bind

// Walk Right Back //

I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome everyday
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothing seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me

Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day

These eyes of mine that gave you loving glances once before
Changed to shades of cloudy gray
I want so very much to see you just like before
I've got to know you're comin' back to stay
Please believe me when I say it's great to hear from you
But there's a lot of things a letter just can't say, oh me

Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day

I'm so lonesome everyday
I'm so lonesome everyday
I'm so lonesome everyday

// Canadian Whiskey //

In the hills of Montana
There's a timber wolf howlin'
The Rangers are prowlin'
For a woman alone
She'd run away
From an Indian lover
He'll never recover
She turned him to stone

She drank Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
She drank it like wine
Her eyes were the color
Of Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
So light brown and fine

Twenty years later
I heard of a woman
She's living alone
Up by Yellowstone Creek
And old Trapper John
Brings her cases of whiskey
Canadian whiskey
He says she never will speak

She drank Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
She drank it like wine
Her eyes were the color
Of Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
So light brown and fine

She drank Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
She drank it like wine
Her eyes were the color
Of Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
So light brown and fine

// Desperadoes Waiting For A Train //

I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, "Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?"

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his "Sidekick"
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
"Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin'"

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

// Wings Of A Dove //

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When trouble surrounds us, when evil comes
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends down His love (sends down his love)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some, but was not forgotten
God sent down His love (sent down his love)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When Jesus went down to the water that day
He was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed His Son
He sent down His love on the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

// Dress Of Laces //

And she has a dress of laces
It's worn in many places
The shoulder hangs upon her by a thread
And she has a need for ahrin'
For someone warm and carin'
And no one sees a heart that's underfed

Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She hasn't seen the man she loves in years

And her mother is a waitress
At the harbour bar, good graces
Where the seamen come a fishin' with their lines
And it was one of them that caught her
And left her with a daughter
Who lives with hate and loving him in mind

Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She hasn't seen the man she loves in years

So the young girl goes to the water
And she calls out for her father
But she ain't seen the old man in some time
Yes, and he was always boastin'
Just a drinkin' and a toastin'
And one day he left his family behind

Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She hasn't seen the man she loves in years

So the mother comes home a drinkin'
With a sailor who's a tinkin' out loud
That he might stay with them awhile
So she loads her mother's pistol
And she shoots him as he whistles
A song about a sailor's life in style

Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She kills the only man she's loved in years
And with him dies her hopes, her dreams, her fears

And she has a dress of laces
It's worn in many places
The shoulder hangs upon her by a thread
And she has a need for ahrin'
For someone warm and carin'
And no one sees a heart that's underfed
And no one sees a heart that's underfed

// Summer Wages //

Never hit seventeen when you play against the dealer
You know that the odds won't ride with you
And never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her
She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages

And we'll keep rolling on till we get to Vancouver
And the woman that I love, she's living there
It's been six long months and more since I've seen her
Maybe she's gambled and gone like summer wages

In all the beer parlors all down along Main Street
The dreams of the seasons get all spilled out on the floor
All the big stands of timber just waiting for falling
And the hookers standing watchfully, waiting by the door

So I'll work on the towboats with my slippery city shoes
Lord! I swore I would never that do again
Through the the gray fog-bound straits where the cedars stand watching
I'll be far off and gone like summer wages
...

Never hit seventeen when you play against the dealer
You know that the odds won't ride with you
And never leave your woman alone with your friends around to steal her
She'll be gambled and gone like summer wages

And the years are gambled and lost like summer wages

// He Was A Friend Of Mine //

He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Never had no money
To pay for his fine
He was a friend of mine

He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
Thousand miles from home
He never hurt no one
He was a friend of mine

He died on the road
He died on the road
Never had no money for to pay for sufficient clothes
(He was a friend)
He was a friend of mine

(I stole)
I stole away and cried
(I stole)
Never had no money and I can't be satisfied
He was a friend of mine

(He was) he was a friend of mine
(He was) he was a friend of mine
When I hear his name you know
I just can't keep from cryin' (and)
(He was) he was a friend of mine
(He was)

// Hard Times Come Again No More //

Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered
Around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more

There's a pale sorrowed maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart whose better days are o'er
Though her voice would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
Oh, hard times come again no more

// Wasn't That A Mighty Storm //

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

You know the year of 1900
Children, many years ago
Death came howling on the ocean
Death calls, you got to go
Now Galveston had a seawall
To keep the water down, and a
High tide from the ocean
Spread the water over the town

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

You know the trumpets gave them warning
You'd better leave this place
Now, no one thought of leaving
Till death stared them in the face
And the trains they all were loaded
The people were all leaving town
The trestle gave way to the water
And the trains they went on down

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

Rain it was a' falling
Thunder began to roll
Lightning flashed like hell fire
The wind began to blow
Death the cruel master
When the wind to blow
Rode in on a team of horses
I cried, "Death, won't you let me go"

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

Hey, now trees fell on the island
And the houses give way
Some they strained and drowned
Some died in most every way
And the sea began to rolling
And the ships they could not stand
And I heard a captain crying
"God save a drowning man"

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

Death your hands are clammy
You got them on my knee
You come and took my mother
Won't you come back after me
And the flood it took my neighbor
Took my brother too
I thought I heard my father calling
And I watched my mother go

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

You know the year of 1900
Children, many years ago
Death came howling on the ocean
Death calls, you got to go

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning, well
Wasn't that a mighty storm
That blew all the people away

// Deportee (Plane Wreck At Los Gatos) //

The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are stacked in their Creosote dumps
They're flying them back to the Mexico border
To pay all their wages to wade back again

My father's own father, he waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees
They rode on the trucks till they took down and died

Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita
Adios, mis amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportee"

Somos ilegales y mal recibidos
(Well, some are illegal and some are not wanted)
Se a caba el contrato y de alli a caminar
(Our work contract's out and we've got to move on)
Six hundred miles to that Mexico border
They chased us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves

Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita
Adios, mis amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportee"

We died in your hills and we died in your deserts
We died in your valleys, we died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes
Both sides of the river we died just the same

The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon
A fireball of lightning, it shook all our hills
Who are all these friends all scattered like dry leaves?
The radio says they are just deportees

Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita
Adios, mis amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportee"

Is this the best way we can grow our best orchards?
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit
To fall like dry leaves and rot on our topsoil
And be known by no name except "deportee"?

Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita
Adios, mis amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportee"

// Yarrington Town //

I packed up my suitcase
Pulled down my old bedroll
And I started to wander
Far from my home
And the time it passed quickly
And the days seemed to be hours
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town

Well, I wandered through the midnights
Of sea-bordered bar lights
And I wandered through the forests
As deep as the sea
But I never got lonesome
Until I'd hear a sad song
One to remind me of Yarrington Town

Well, I followed a miner
To his home in the North woods
And he promised to love me
As long as I'd stay
And I even saw lightning
Touch a stone in the mine field
Could not touch the lightning
In Yarrington Town

So I packed up my suitcase
I pulled out my old bedroll
And I started to wander
On back to my home
And the time it passed slowly
And the days seemed to be years
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town
I'm going home to your city
And Yarrington Town

// I Still Miss Someone //

At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

If go out on a party
To look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
(I see)
I see them everywhere
(I miss)
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
But I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
(I see)
I see them everywhere
(I miss)
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

And I still miss someone

// Try The Love //

Before you marry, before you mend
Or have someone's children, long before then
You could find something with somebody new
Try the love I'm offering in my open arms
Before you do

We should have quarreled, it's so unwise
To cut yourself loose with only some lies
Wasn't my first time, it won't be my last
Try the love that took only a minute to grow
It won't die that fast

Try the love that the keeper of the keys
Told me one time was clearly not for me
He's not keepin' no more
It's the kind when held up to a flame
Whispers one word, darlin' always your name
Of this you can be sure

I have a home now, you should come back
It's got so much room that I can't unpack
This is my wish, dear, a now spoken truth
Try the love that once hidden now seems so alive
It's waiting on you

Try the love that once hidden now seems so alive
It's waiting on you

// The Streets Of Baltimore //

I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
I bought the one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well, my heart was filled with laughter
When I saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth
Was Baltimore at night
Well, a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore

I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
We bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
But every night when I came home
With every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well, I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
But, I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loves me
Now I'm goin' back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yes, my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

// Darcy Farrow //

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And they promised to marry before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us, one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet in his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beautyin Virginia City too
At dusty sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

// If I Had A Hammer (The Hammer Song) //

If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Well I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
