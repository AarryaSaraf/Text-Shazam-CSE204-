Album: TheLovingKind

// One Of These Days //

We walk along the Hudson when it snows here in Manhattan
Seems we've lived our lives so out of place
You touch my cheek and I do wonder how this happened
That two young lovers could pack their dreams and move from the Texas Plains

Oh, I'm gonna take us back where we belong
Where you can see it in the stars that the weather's comin' on
One of these days

Now, our daddies grew cotton, spittin' dust of a mornin'
We met on a school bus rollin' through the autumn fields our daddies raised
Beneath a hot August sky our mothers waved goodbye
My daddy tipped his hat with a tear in his eye
When we left for the city, where the sun rarely shines
It was a 'hunnerd' an' two in the shade

Oh, I'm gonna take us back where we belong
Where you can see it in the stars that the weather's comin' on
One of these days

Hey, do you wanta take a cab uptown, watch the skaters go
'Round and 'round?
We could talk about leavin' this town some other day
And I suppose we look like natives here, this middle-aged couple with silver hair
And on cold winter nights this love we share
Is still a 'hunnerd' and two in the shade

// Cotton //

If I came back to the land of cotton
Would you love just me?
Old loves lost are ne'er forgotten
That's the way it's supposed to be

Are you short or are you long?
Are you easy to see
Are you weak or are you strong?
Makes no never to me

All the ballerina sees when her world's on fire
Is where she puts her feet
And if she burns her toes, she'll just jump higher
Never skip a beat

I've been good most of the time
Since you last saw me
You come 'cross my mind from time to time
Now look at me

I'm standing at your door
With my heart in your hands
Ain't you gonna ask me in?
If you say "no," I'll understand dear
And never come south again

If I came back to the land of cotton
Would you love just me?
Old loves lost are ne'er forgotten
That's the way it's supposed to be

// The Loving Kind //

They were the loving kind
She was black and he was white
In Virginia nineteen fifty-eight
They found love amongst the hate

Well the law said they could not wed
They married anyway
The sheriff put them both in jail
Separated till they made their bail

They changed the heart of a nation
With their wedding vows
From the highest court in the land
Their union would lawfully stand
Simply Mildred and Richard
That's how they'll be remembered
They proved that love is truly blind
They were the loving kind

The Lovings lived a quiet life
In their Virginia home
And while the case worked it's way through the courts
They brought three children to this world
Richard died in seventy-five
Mildred kept their love alive
Till the spring of two thousand-eight
Fifty years beyond the hate

They changed the heart of a nation
With their wedding vows
From the highest court in the land
Their union would lawfully stand
Simply Mildred and Richard
That's how they'd be remembered
They proved that love is truly blind
They were the loving kind

// Money Changes Everything //

In the rush of the river and the roar of the crowd
You can't hear the silence calling
When it's merely a whisper of a cloud
In a crazy storm that pulls you on

Take a pill or you might take a loss
And the vicious circle tightens
But compromise comes with a cost
Maybe you can't see but it's clear to me

Money changes everything
It changes everything

Make a little and it makes your day
And the heavens smile upon you
Make a bundle and you're blown away
To a different game and the rules all change

Leave a husband or trade a wife
You're in the bigger picture now
Take a country or take a life
If it's moolah's will there's gold in them hills

Money changes everything
It changes everything
Money changes everything
It changes everything

If you think it makes your world go round
It makes your world go round
If you think it makes your world go round
It makes your world go round

Money changes everything
It changes everything
Money changes everything
It changes everything

It changes everything
It changes everything
It changes everything

// Up Against The Rain //

You ran up against the rain
Everyday of your short life
Suffered for your muse without complaining
Never heard you swear life isn't fair
But it doesn't make it right
You left the world knowing all too well what pain is

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain

You listen to the songs
And then you wrote your own
Somewhere along the way
You passed the muse along
I feel your presence in this room
Beneath the wailing moon
It's good to know that dying couldn't tame you

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain

Last night the weather turned
This morning we had snow
Today they'll lay you in the ground
Someday we'll all know
Where it is we go
My tears will say goodbye
While the rain is coming down

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain

// Not Innocent Enough //

What the hell was I doing there in that fast food parking lot?
They say I robbed the restaurant and a Memphis cop got shot
I was trying to feed my habit, I was scared and I was high
It was never my intention that anyone should die

And just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name is Philip Workman and I'm not innocent enough

It's not a long walk from a trailer park to a Tennessee cell block
But I got saved behind these bars, soon I'll give my soul to God
Reverend Joe is praying for me and the family left behind
They say my bullet took his life but that bullet was not mine

Oh, just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name is Philip Workman and I'm not innocent enough

I had no money for a lawyer to fight the system from within
There's no justice for the poor from the witness they brought in
Circumstance and random chance, I never meant to do no harm
Now that cop and I, we've both died from that needle in my arm

And there where those who called for mercy in those final days
Even the officer's daughter cried to grant me stay
But I'm not innocent enough, I'm not innocent enough
I'm not innocent enough, I'm not innocent enough

And just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
Just how many of us are innocent enough?
My name was Philip Workman, I was not innocent enough

// Across America //

I've heard enough from pundits
I've heard our leaders speak
I tell you know I'd rather talk
To the people in the street
'Cause you don't know someone
Until you've looked them in the eye
And that gave me a purpose
And every reason why

I drove myself across America
From Sea to shining Sea
From the Rocky coast of Maine
To the mighty redwood trees
From the plains of North Dakota
To the Gulf of Mexico
It's good to know
That hope's alive again
Across America

I spoke to folks in New Orleans
With hammers in their hands
There's a waitress in Missouri
Who wants her own health plan
And to the workers up in Michigan
In all the auto plants
They're the working men and women
Saying "Yes, we can"

Your checks and stocks and banks
Can't take our hope away
You can't foreclose on hope
Nobody has to pay

I drove myself across America
From Sea to shining Sea
From the Rocky coast of Maine
To the mighty redwood trees
From the plains of North Dakota
To the Gulf of Mexico
It's good to know
That hope's alive again
Across America

// Party Girl //

She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over

Now her husband watches TV
After working hard all day
And she's crying into her pillow
'Cause it's night time
And she want's to play

She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over

She can't cry to mama
She can't go home to daddy any more
They both tried to warn her
She was throwing away her sweet young life
When she walked out that door

She was a party girl
Now the party's over
She was a beauty
And that's changing too
Now she's barefoot and having babies
She was a party girl
Now the party's over

// Sing //

I heard the music long ago
Songs that rent the air
Fading in and out at night
While I was lying there
Voices soft and lonely
And later Rock and Roll
Flying across the Rio Grande
Straight into my soul

Trying to find a reason
Trying to find that rhyme
Rolling with the river
Trying to keep time
And in the end I wouldn't change a thing
I'd sing

Music is the life in me
It's the melody I breathe
It gives me strength in harder times
And reason to believe
Endless miles of highway
Every step hard earned
It seems it was all mapped out
All the twists and turns

Still trying to find a reason
Trying to find that rhyme
Still rolling with the river
Trying to keep time
And in the end I wouldn't change a thing
I'd sing

// Things I Don't Need //

This house is full of memories that aren't mine
Pieces, I thought I would clear out over time
Life takes over, I get ahead of myself
I turn around and I've filled up the shelf

With things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind

The one thing that's not on the shelf is my heart since it fell
Picking it up is a thing that I've never have done well
True love always seems to fly by me
I wonder if it's one of those things I don't need

Things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind

Like a bag you unpack at the end of a trip
And you're wondering why did I take all of this?

These things I don't need that weigh me down
Things I don't want but still keep around
I woke up today and made up my mind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind
From now on I'll leave all those things I don't need behind

// Still Life //

You walked the line all your life
You never thought you'd have to change it
You're always there to give advice
You never thought you'd have to take it

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

You need to change, you don't know how
Your life could use a reformation
If you could see you as I see you now
I know you'd change the situation

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

It's always someone else's fault
You're always right, you're never wrong
You think that life's a game but this is real

You think you can just walk away
And leave destruction in your wake
But you're not walking anywhere near

Is it still life if you are drowning?
Is it still life when you fall?
Is it still life when you can't carry
On and on and on and on and on?

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life when you're torn
It's still life when you're walking
On and on and on and on and on and on

It's still life but it's broken
It's still life but it's torn
It's still life but you're walking
On and on and on and on and on and on and on

It's still life

// Tequila After Midnight //

Tequila after midnight
Drives loneliness away
Makes strangers all around you look familiar
And tequila after midnight
Makes you feel so warm
Makes you think you feel good when you don't

It's the same sad familiar story
Nothing about it's new
Just about someone who loved and lost
And it still hurt through and through

They say it drives you crazy
Well I can hardly care
For quite some time now
That's just where I've been
And they say tequila kills you
If you drink too much
Lord, I hope they make tequila long enough

It's the same sad familiar story
Nothing about it's new
Just about someone who loved and lost
And it still hurt through and through

They say it drives you crazy
Well I can hardly care
For quite some time now
That's just where I've been
And they say tequila kills you
If you drink too much
Lord, I hope they make tequila long enough

// Pour Me A Drink //

Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul

Look at my life
Here in these photographs
Look at these faces
What a story they tell
There was a time
When I knew how to laugh
I'd drink to forget
But I remember it well

Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul

So many promises
So many daydreams and plans
So many chances
That I let slip through my hands

Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul
