Yeh, it's your world, I see you shining nigga, go and get it
Ooowee
Make sure you see me nigga when you touch down, I'm still here

[Rapsody:]
Fresh out the bed in my slippers, all my niggas is niggas
Brush my teeth while I figure how to get up on these riches
'Cause the Acura's rented and I need something more tinted
Hop in the whip and we been it, I call that whip Betty White
Whole white thing, like money they counting, I see it
Broke as fuck but we dreaming, out the window I'm leaning
Get out the lane, and when I get it ain't gon' change my nigga
I'ma still be the same regular ass nigga talking that

[Anderson.Paak:]
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like

Was the same back then as you are now, let's hope you stick around, come on

[Rapsody (Anderson.Paak):]
I'm a window for homies, I know all of 'em watch
Time and time again reminiscing, remembering blocks
I used to walk around on 'em it's been a while now we back
Gotta speak on the youth to throw all my dreams in the air
My mind a hula hoop going round but got nothing to spare
Nothing to waste, head in the clouds, like I was high on that grape
I'ma pull up in something ignant, I promise just watch
Enough to make momma worry about them profiling cops
But I can't change I was raised by the old ones (oooh)
And when they see me they be like "what you know huh?
Don't forget all your family and where you came from
Money change, the spirit shouldn't change none"
Yeh I know I'm dope, all my homies they do
Malcolm Adekanbi, I'm humble as Gandhi though
Straight out my momma, came out with a Straight Outta Compton flow
I'ma an animal on it with Anderson, I love ya bo
We on that
(Oooeee)
Go and shoot your shots, show 'em you can box, we won't ever stop that's that Puffy in me
(Oooeee)
Well up to the block, headed to the top, got them things slapping in the car like
(Oooeee)
Who that coming round the way? Come around the way, damn you fine as hell, come around this way
(Oooeee)
Roll the windows down, yeh I like 'em brown, with your lighter brown, where we going now?
(Oooeee)
Up the way, where the boys at? Don't wear your good clothes cause the homies that smoke that
(Oooeee)
And the homies all know that, my head is in the clouds but my feet ain't left ground yet like
(Oooeee)
Yeh I'm good with all the fam, if they better kiss me tell 'em put the money in my hand already
(Oooeee)
Banging on the can, break it down, break it down, everybody
What they saying now?
(Oooeee)
I'm playing outta your Bron Brons to have you running up the blunts, taking they pom poms
Cheering for me and my team while we eating on Wonton
Squeaking like Miyagi, I shout like the sun
So, who your sponsor? I told 'em I'm a monster like Luke Cage
Take a shot and watch me walk away with just juice stains
Used to tell me "you just wasting your time with them"
Still I come around just to show 'em this confidence like

[Anderson.Paak:]
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like
Ooowee
I see what you started, I know what you promised, you're owning, you're popping like
Ooowee
Soon as you put your feet to the ground I'll lace you with a pack of that loud, some of that
Ooowee
Was the same back then as you are now, let's hope you stick around, come on

Ooowee
Yeh!
Ooowee
Yeh

// Laila's Wisdom //

Look don't worry bout anything they told you
Remember what she SAID about winter and what the cold do
Everything's a season and some things you gotta go through
Believe me I don' seen it all, you're young talking to the old you
When haters come around look em down tell em "we don't owe you"
You gon lose some friends but those circles are better than the ovals
A black man left the oval
Keep that style you got soulful
The best of the best gon fear you
Sky's the limit see, I told you
You gon be the difference between McDonald's, Burger King and Whole Foods
Do your thang and slip thru ib em they ain't gon have no clue
You won't need no toll booths, they'll pay attention, Hov do
They'll ask you for advice tell em the same thing I told you
Should be a crime to be this fly and awesome
And to think love is all it cost em
Feel like Jordan this the ball that Pippen tossed em
I'm the underdog and gold is what flossin'
When they told me my chances of losing was higher than divorces
You gotta know your worth and work 'cus I can't force ya
Growing up I shopped at Kmart and Ross', celebrated every win
And learned to learn from all my losses
I never signed paperwork without reading the clauses
My parents worked way too hard to not get no credit for it
I'm a trip like Grayson Allen
Y'all never made me VALID
I learn that from Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen
I'm the other one them another ones screaming like Khaled
We don't match up, ask my stylist
I rock Nike and New Balance
I drink water by gallons, y'all should call me captain
I was told to be the flow and not follow it while y'all actin'
I'm the better version of what you used to think and call talent
I been bankin, check my balance
You a bet away from skidrow
I owe Sallie Mae but owe my people way mo'
God rested on the seventh day
And worked on me on day fo'

I've been killing for a long time
My lawyers gotta caseload
I cracked the code, it's no longer safe for y'all
Kujo still the scariest of all the dogs
After that come all my dawgs
Talent level's thru the walls
I'm Juggernaut, riding with my car doh' locked
Coppers known to hang out on these kinda blocks
Don't get shot!
They say we 3/5ths human, well the rest of me's an autobot
I'm really hot
You should ask my team and dem
Jamla's still the squad and my confidence is thru the roof
I appreciate the compliments
Laila's Wisdom, rest in peace. I love you dear

Yo, we good over here, here (here)
We good over here here (here)
Yeah, we good over here here uh
Yo, we good over here, here (here)
We good over here here (here)
Yeah, we good over here here uh

// Power //

Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Lance Skiiiwalker (Rapsody):]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Rapsody:]
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my mama I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain't die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3am car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don't do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they don't like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch 'em tap dance
Bombs over Baghdad to have a flag to brag 'bout
Don't make you a big boy, 'cause you got a nice stack
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse
That's power when you know the game, I'm feeling like a Champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap 'bout what I rap 'bout
Black child
God, love and textiles
Point, blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile
I saw the goal from 8 miles
With every stone you threw I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case
I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin' me
See, that's just the appeal in me
Respek on my name
Why y'all niggas so emotional?
Power

[Lance Skiiiwalker (Rapsody):]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Rapsody:]
Power up with the word
I got it from my God
He said a good shepherd don't trip over what they heard
Let 'em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said I'm good as herbs
Get 'em high, get 'em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man-made, but whether or not you paid don't help or hurt
It's a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted, I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect the real ones
No one as real as I
It's just me and young blood, this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin; the same hour
I ain't Five Percent, 'less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that, the rest beneath me all cowards
When it spits, look around, it's meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, yeah this what you call power

Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Let's talk about power
Let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin' and bouncin
Cravin' and drownin in words the day I pronounce it
Let's talk about power
Let's talk about do'ers and don't'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin' Coronas and Black & Milds
Donuts in El Caminos
Talkin' loud, scrapin' and combin'
Residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that's ever been 'head of me, aw
Let's talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He's bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more fo' he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Granny's and Heaven arms
I'm in Jamaica like "wah gwaan," my feet is out
My hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
Me, I go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
Rude boy, me, I ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
I shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
Debates about who's the prominent emcee of the millennium
And it's all for the Benjamins
And I'm all of y'all nemesis
And I'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who Kendrick is
The only One that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, that's power

Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
And may the force that be with us forever
Be right here to guide us
Your sensitivity is very sensitive to mine

Hey, what up, cause? Man
It's ya boy Crunch, man, checkin' in, man
Heard you playin' in a couple weeks, man
Holla at me when you get this message, though
Holla at me, it's important, holla at me
Oh yeah, I forget to tell you, I got a new toy
Got a brand new toy
So you know what I'm gettin' ready to do to it, baby
Turnt out that chrome on that paint, baby
That chrome comin' in June, baby
I been chicken chasin' all summer, ya dig me?
I been chasin' chicken all summer, pocket muscle
That's the new thing now, pocket muscle, a.k.a. chicken

// Chrome (Like Ooh) //

Boys on the block told boys on the spot
You gotta a shot youngin', you ain't gotta get shot
Dangerous to measure a man by the size of his cock
I was told to measure a King by the size of his flock
Who your leader and where y'all going? My army big enough carry a boeing'
Ride off to the Lox
Hair braided, twisted, wind blowin' thru my knots
9th, G, Jones, Khrysis, Amp, Kash, Nottz
Mama got soulfood cooking in the pots
You in a grave situation you should look into a plot
Dirt on my name, boy I'm way too smart
Chest full of a pride don't mean nothin' without heart
One life to live so you gotta make a mark
West side told one thang, don't never rock with marks
I only rock with mark, that's my lil brother
That's the big homie, daddy said always keep a G on me
I got the dagger back that thang still sharp
I really play the game y'all commentate behind doors
Don't never say my name cause it might end yours
I never been lazy but I seen a plenty Forest
Whitaker, the with of her, good Lord
Ain't got keys like Khaled but I still open doors
A few in my crew flew the coop
The day I fly the coupe I'll probably get woop woop'd
Speeding thru the laney, what we call high schoolin'
Painted that like Delaney, we see it in color too
Synesthetic, know everybody won't GET it
I'm patient though, no wonder they regret it

When I ooh
Pull up in the coupe
When the chrome coming?
It's coming in June
When the chrome coming?
It's coming in June
Ooh, ooh

Pull up on em
Naw, hold pull back
Don't show all your cards
They ain't worth that
Spoon feed these niggas
Baby teeth these nigga
Who they teethin' on?
Me, my nigga

Chrome been spinning on my mind
Hair, face new outfit, I'm fine
Trips round the world with homies we all flyin'
Everything they say ain't gospel, lames lie
Boys always taught don't cry, but need to cry
I was taught to respect the driver more than I do the ride
Ride with me homie, ain't nothing to hold the wheel
When I was hungry you looked out, you always got me a meal
Workin on my glowup, they askin if I got mills
I got family, I got stress, got success and bills
Good God!
Put 20 inches on the axle
We cop them classic ol' thangs in the Hill like Axel
Lines better than all the rappers aligned if they ask you
Ridin' Shotgun, sittin askew
On the straight narrow
I called up mama up
Told her 'bout my summer reign
She thought 'bout Carl Thomas
I said no no no, no no I more like Giannis
Must be real to get these honors
That's why they put G's on us

I'm Real
Represent where you from?
Snow Hill
When you gon pull with up new chrome on your wheels?
Chicken chasin all summer, pocket muscle real
I'm Real
Represent where you from?
Snow Hill
When you gon pull with up new chrome on your wheels?
Chicken chasin all summer, pocket muscle real

Big money on ya' visa
Only way you get her, only way she won't leave ya
She said, ("How much you think it cost for this weave, huh? ")
You like the way it look? Well baby, it's gon' cost some
Spoiled, look good, she like real leather
She like exotic trips, good weather
All you got to offer is to love her better, better than the rest
I told her, "You ain't need a dime to be better than the best"
Thought it would impress, picked her a bouquet
She only want new boots like Beyonce
She like I got dreams that'll one day pay
She looking at you like ("Baby, I ain't got time to waste")

[Rapsody:]
He just wanna lay up in yo' place
Livin' off yo' income, chillin' all day
Borrowed her the car and bring it back on low tank
With his homeboys' homeboys playing 2k
You his come-up, he don't wanna come up
That's why he preying on independent women
Grocery list, and all the bills is paid
He on the family plans, so all the calls is made, yeah
Most of those go to others
Tryna make you feel bad saying you don't love him
Buy him new Js, whips, and threads
He always got excuses, on Polo bids like pay up

But, he just want a baby girl that he know can

// Ridin' //

Ridin'
Tryna survive it
Liquor so dark (dark)
And the club so lit (lit)
And my mind so gone (gone)
And my soul so sick (sick)

Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah, shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit!
Ridin'
She ridin' (where you goin'?!)
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit

[Rapsody:]
Dark clouds surround you everywhere you go
I know the type
You only attract violent, self esteem issue kinda types
Club with your children, 5th of liquor and skittiwee
Try to run that game on me but baby you shit'n me
Same hemoglobin, family tree, I know you very well
We all got somebody in our family that we can't save from hell
Pressure, pain, memories of bad thangs you been through
Cried so many tears is surprising you ain't mildewed
Look at me
Ya can't do it
You know that Imma gon' see thru it
Running with them funny folk
We know they won't see to ya
Loved ones gon ride with ya
Don't turn your back on me
Truth hurt, I know it do but, please don't lie to me
Good or bad I'm here for ya, that's what you call family
The world going crazy, it's easy lose to lose your sanity
Looking for a way out, see you beefing with des rah rahs
Searching for yourself, I see you nightly when you drive by
This nigga, that nigga, don't matter if they holla
You let em in, next thing you gotta another baby Dada
Circling, circling, riding, smoking, ya high too
Tryna find the voice that can tell you where to find you

Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah, shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit!
Ridin'
She ridin' (where you goin'?!)
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit

[GQ:]
Brain scattered like showers, I'm losing power
My mind is starting to fuck with me
Dealing with lots of feelings, depression becoming publicly
Luckily I'm in line, I'll be damn if a nigga cuttin' me
Climb a mountain for mo'
No safety, or rush for me
Take a shuttle to space
Space is never enough for me
Peddlin' by the moon they assuming someone abducted me
Judging me by the day, Aliens criticizing
Know why you hate to watch 'cause my timing is hypnotizing
They tell me, shoot for the stars
May need to cop me a rifle
Changing like choir boy on that day he forgot his bible
Never try to adjust you just fuckin' try to complain
And I try to do not like you, in my view we ain't the same
Monthly collectin' mo' the feelin' how I'm vibin'
Everything for the ones I love got my mind ridin'
Turbulence, hopefully my wings hold
Good wishes and prayers we gon need those

[Rapsody:]
8: 07 PM on the dot
Party round the way if you tryna catch a ride
Don't matter what you wear ain't no code for da night
Just hurry up tho, we all tryna slide
Girls in free, boys pay the 5
My Back seat full, everybody let's ride
Turn the volume way up high yo, that's jam she spit that "ahhh"
If a cop knock everybody shhh drop
Hide the liquor, we don't wanna get popped
Mr officer is there a problem?
This was a just a small get together
I understand we can help you solve it
No problem, we'll turn down the volume
No, problem, we'll turn down the volume
No, problem, we'll turn down the volume
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, up

// Sassy //

Arnetta - know me very well
La'Neise she know me very well
Jabari I know him very well
I got around guards, no carousel
When it got deep, I grew wings and parasailed
Read the bible way more than fairytales
Thought I wouldn't elevate I took the stairwell
Watch em stare well, yeah I'm very well
See these pretty wings, I maxed well
I'm Fortunate, I'm the sexiest
Imma tomboys, you love a tomboy
Check the time y'all all too late, tick tick
Got no chill, but I do got the netflix
You can watch the movies or me
I like my tshirts with no sleeves
Ain't gotta bare arms to show I'm deadly
In a league of my own
Watch what you say you don't know who you among
Speak a little truth, (ahhh)
Here come the stones
Throw me a few, look I got good bones
Diamonds tween my knees
Oil wells in thighs
Does my sassiness upset you?
Oh, you mad cause I survived?!
On the way up

Oh, you mad that I survived and I ain't comin down
Squad! Squad! Squad! Squad baby, Look around
See me coming, see me coming
We ain't slowin down
On the way up, on the way up
You can't touch me now

Snow Hill is my home, hour from the beach
Small town beef it'll don't get that deep
I grew up with you, and you grew up with me
Throw a few hands, and we good next week
Niggas wanna buck it ain't hot enough for heat
Homie, I know your whole family
Johnny, Antwan, rest in peace
I went off to college, young Denise
Young Kelis, how I left my address
Pulled up to Grammys errrh, all red
When I step to mic Um! See em all dead
Visionary, won't never scared
Never backed down if I was ever dared
I can't be compared, I wear a black berets
I got a panther in me, I'm Cameron nigga
I only play ball where the winners winning, ok

Diamonds tween my knees
Oil wells in thighs
Does my sassiness upset you?
Oh, you mad cause I survived?!
On the way up

Oh, you mad that I survived and I ain't comin down
Squad! Squad! Squad! Squad baby, Look around

// Nobody //

[Amber Navran:]
Can we just sigh? Can we let go?
Breathe in and sigh, just let it show

[Anderson.Paak:]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

[Rapsody:]
Nobody know nada
We all know the fate of Assata if Cuba don't harbor
Nobody know I'm harder on myself than lonely fathers
Watching Mrs. Parker, these days nobody know who authored
Rhymes of rappers on carpets
Nobody know who real or not
Nobody still know who shot Big and Pac, I'm bothered
Prayed to our fathers for sins I committed summers
Don't nobody know how many but we know our days are numbered
Oh my God
Nobody know the true religion
Why nobody know to show respect and mind your business
I know prison business, but nobody know how many innocent in it
Nobody know that cures cancer been made by the chemist
Nobody know the cost of a dollar worth less to em Kendrick
Nobody smart enough would ever say racism ended
I get winded by the weight of it all
'Cus everybody talkin' shit but don't know nothin' at all

[Anderson.Paak:]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

[Rapsody:]
Nobody know I'm scared of personal shit
'Cus everybody judge you, love to change the intent
Internet got no chill, nobody know how it feel to be an artist
Look, nigga this some marvelous shit
Before politics, arguing real vs radio hits
It's all Hip Hop, you can't divide what ain't different
Don't like all underground music, I don't hate all music that isnt
I was just making it clap to Wacka Flacka last Christmas, Clap!
Clap for a nigga with her rappin' ass
Nobody know if tomorrow promised live like its your last
Tell that crush you got you love em, they might love you back
Nobody know if we don't speak, we don't know the math
Google the name, if nobody know nobody can fill these shoes I'm in
Watch niggas that joke around and say they just playin
Beatin me your odds look better bettin' Lt. Dan could walk water
Barefoot, runnin' with Forest chasing a van
If nobody know that this gon' show you that I ain't playin, nigga

[Anderson.Paak:]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

If nobody, nobody matters
Why do I bother
But, I thought I had the answer
But, who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody else matter
Who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody matters
Who knows anyway

[Black Thought:]
Lost soldier with the bars on the shoulders of my uniform
That makes 'em ask what I do and who I do it for
Musically, I been on my Chiwetel Ejiofor
That's 12 years a slave, but I'm on year 23 or 4
Been a lyrical grand wizard like Theodore
I'm on the same wave length the sister Rapsody is on
I love it when she get on her Bahamadia joint
If she wasn't true she would've never gotten me involved
Between the world and me like Mr. Ta-Nehisi Coates
Nobody know the artist Mr. Ta-Nehisi quotes
Laughin a boars, they grasping at straws to sniff the dope
Pen been engaged for ages we should probably elope
Nobody knows how I shoot for the stars or aim at the moon
Or how I put a band-aid pon bullet wound
Or, how no matter who you are I'm just as good as you
If not better
Shit, I ain't even sure my mother knew
It hurts, yeah 2014 was the worst year
I lost the only person aware of my worst fear
That's when I shifted up to fifth from first gear
And then I headed back to work and had church there
Oh my God

// Black & Ugly //

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Yeah, they call me black and ugly
But I go so hard, make the whole world love me

[Rapsody:]
I remember when y'all used to call me ugly
Isnt it ironic know you all just wanna love me
So concerned with weight I'm mo' Chucky than I am chubby
Confidence of a porn star the day I cut the horns off
Took all my demons threw em down hill in a buggy
Then stood on top the hill and did the milly rock and dougie
Screamin only God can judge me
I'm feeling like the misle
Now y'all come around and kiss up to me, wish you knew
All masta's grandchildren fantasize bout Crystal's
You could neva diss me
I'm more Leo, you more grizzly
Watch yo mouth these country boys carrying tools like Dabnis Brickey
The tesla, the BMi benzo I ain't picky
Talking appearance ain't no diss to me
No one dissin' me
I been to hell and back
And came back up here screaming victory
Still rockin with the triple 3
9 Wonder, my summer
Feeling like Pete & Pete's
In memory of D&D
I'm still rockin whether it's me rapping of Quentin T
You all about the benjamins, I'm all about the family
I got the fellas rockin, see we working on a dynasty
Black and ugly as ever and still nobody fine as me
No one been as kind as me
Only one kind of me
I'm already better than what you niggasl still trying to be

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Yeah, they call me black and ugly
But I go so hard, make the whole world love me

[Rapsody:]
Brown skin persons
All my light skin persons
We so mutherfuckin beautiful, wow
It's personal
Diary, and frankly this game
I'm Stylin
My camp concentration, and focus been on a thousand
Black bottom Jordan's
My sole black as organs
Of chain smokers and churches that sang hymns to organs
Ol' bae, looking for love but I can't reward em
Never be the same like what they did to New Orleans
You're never gonna part them
Connected like apartments
Squad thick as thieves, I flip out like cartwheels
Get better like Lamar did
I'm never gonna owe dem
Man versus machine don't underestimate a soldier
D Block my sister
E Money my sister
Tia that's my clique I only rock with real sistas
Snow Hill my home not once did you hear me stutter
But you hung on every single word that I ever uttered
'Cus, ion smoke crack motherfucker I sell It
Send it through the pipeline, they know who I rep
They know how I rap
They know ion rest
The system quick to arrest
If Bobby Brown tell it
I'm the best new edition
Heard ya whispering Tracy Ellis
I'm more than black-ish
This what real life rap is

My hair don't look natural so they question my blackness
Rachel got over, Guess that's a fucked up standard
Fuck ya'll even, Fuck ya'll odd
How I'm weird cause ion rap bout dumb shit like ya'll?
See I'm feel just like BOB, baby
Where the love at?
Don't need no more trouble
But got beef by the double
That's a different kinda drive thru
Mono e mono
Put my fist up for everyone that dissed us
They talk about my lisp more than they put me on the list whew
I know shit 'bout him and I know shit 'bout her
But, I don't shit where I sleep
So don't shit on none of ya'll
That ain't in my armor
I believe in karma
I whip my ass with Charmin everyday, nigga
Just like you
Hope you brush your teeth fo' you get up and talk shit bout me

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Yeah, they call me black and ugly
But I go so hard, make the whole world love me

// You Should Know //

[Part 1 - You Should Know]

[Merna:]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

[Rapsody:]
Papa just copped a Mustang
Lookin' at you like it must sting
Sweatin' me and mine, I bet a dollar your nuts stank
Hoppin' on the left coast learnin' new west slang
Naturally better, versus them, it's like flint to a cup of rain bars
I'm on par with Rocky and Clubber Lang posse
Know I'm possibly the best they ever seen
Yeah, I'm possibly the best you ever seen
Young Gu yellin' I should rippity rap more
I'm known to black out, y'all resemble the Oscars
Flow so much I need life guards
Not like Rikers, them some whole new bars
Influenced by many but I'm a whole new star, yeah
There's levels to this but I'm a whole new floor
They talkin' keys to success but I'm a whole new door
Still slippin' through traffic screamin' that the allure
I'm breakin' the law, was too much to ever ignore
I been exceedin' the limit since I had an Accord
Always had a need for speed before I met that boy
9th Wonder, I spent the summer bumpin' Wuuuu, nigga (Wuuu, nigga)
Now they like, "Wooo, nigga!" (wooo, nigga)
Been hearin' you for a few, nigga (for a few, nigga)
It's true too many can't fuck with ya
Uh, hope you know the realness in that bar
I know some rappers only nice to me as jesters
Who really just afraid 'cause they know I go that hard
Askin' if so-and-so and I are gon' rap together, yeah
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried about it
There's room in this game, it ain't crowded
Aimin' at the top nowadays, y'all worried 'bout Miley Cyrus
That's a tear in my eye that I ain't cried
It's some paths to a milli homie, you ain't tried
I count ten by fives, I'm always halfway there in my mind
It's on you to catch up this time
'Cause you know

[Merna:]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

[Rapsody:]
Dropped out of poo-poo weighin' 6-2 with a loose screw
That the doctor couldn't glue, ooh look mama, she said
This world a game, you crack with two commas
When Tutankhamun was Africana, you were a black diamond
Know too many stars turn to comets
We run from the comics until we subjects to the comics
I'm a hero, don't be stressin' the zeroes and the commas
Lookin' anacondas, know they comin' with apples and oranges Satan playin' me, I ain't Adam unless we talkin' 'bout bombin'
Over Baghdad, you look bad tryna to spar with me
I'm a lethal weapon, a saber or a razor, Darth Vader, Al Qaeda
Every friend of Jada, that set it off, I'm a midget at labor
Deliverin' babies the size of raiders, opinions were made
Ultimatums got none so don't come lookin' for favors
I'm tired of you fakers, Carolina, but I still rep the Lakers
Westside, Eastside, every side my tithes good with my neighbors
Double back on my sins and pray one day I'm good with my maker
Tomato, tomato don't apply, you better watch what you say to me
Everythin' ain't okay to me, everybody won't cater me
Though I know I'm a child of destiny, fulfillment is up to me
Up to your neck in debt for every bet you threw up against me
Lord listen, forgive me, I ain't got no sympathy flowers
They say it's better to die with pride than to die as a coward
I say some situations call for our pride to be swallowed
So we live to watch payback come in the form of good karma
'Cause you know

[Merna:]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

[Part 2 - Bustalude]

[Busta Rhymes:]
Yeah
You know I heard what he said right?
Loving you was all I wanna do
My whole life
Rapsody
Please let your brother Busta Rhymes elaborate on this topic a little further
You know the subject of love
Let me get on my Barry White shit real quick

Royal empress queen, damn, I so adore you
There's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you
I been lookin' for this forever, been searchin' abroad
For that original woman lovin', the nurture to God
The power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent
Universal alignment, I respect your refinement
The focus to blossom this love is my only assignment
I wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing
And when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches
Say to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures
Usually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up
After we fuck, I'ma face you and kick my feet up
The way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder
The type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her
You're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter
And I wish that I could find a way to multiply her
I'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her
And when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire
Put your hand up in the air, girl
Let me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl
Damn, you got me swingin', girl
What makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl
Yeah baby, you special, you're one of one
If the decision's up to us, we ain't never done
Let's get back to the fun

// A Rollercoaster Jam Called Love //

[Musiq Soulchild:]
My darling baby
I know it gets crazy sometimes
But this here relationship is ours to figure out
But, we gonna make it
If we can just find a way to
Get through the grey

[Rapsody:]
Some days I wake up and I feel like
I don't know what's wrong and don't care what's right
And I ain't sayin' that's it you
Just saying times I think of myself more than I do you
To give you proper love I gotta love myself some
You gotta find yourself something, get you a hobby or something
During grey spaces we existing in
When we ain't quite a couple but we more than friends
I think about coexisting and how to succeed at it
We gotta give each other space just to breathe a bit
I don't want things to become too routine with us
It's alright, everyday we ain't gon talk that much
Just knowing I got you is enough for me
And you respect me having individuality
That's what makes us whole
That's what keeps us happy
Even in love u gotta keep your soul
Catch me?

[Musiq Soulchild:]
My darling baby
I know it gets crazy sometimes
But this here relationship is ours to figure out
But, we gonna make it
If we can just find a way to
Get through the grey

[Rapsody:]
Sometimes we just existing and it's alright
Days we ain't unhappy nor on cloud nine
Just keepin up with traffic riding zoning out
I asked you what's wrong you tell me nothing babe I'm alright
I guess every journey come with long yellow lights
Slow down is what it's telling me, I'm tellin me, look
You oughta really listen to the signs you get in life
Tryna follow my own advice
Too many of my friends approaching 30
Upset that they ain't nobody's wife
I know better than to rush hmm
That's suicide
We just starting out
We got a few hills to climb
If you meet me halfway I swear I got the time
To figure it out, that's why I'm asking for a little some space
Cause even couples need a couple of minutes for a mental break
So don't trip babe, I'm just tryna breathe, relax
Love ain't easy days gon come like that

[Rapsody & Musiq Soulchild:]
'Cause that's my rollercoaster
My rollercoaster love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love
'Cause that's my rollercoaster love

[Rapsody:]
My insecurities don't help at all
There's still love there
Hope he don't stay upset for long
Are we there yet?
On some Ice Cube and Nia Long
Seems we are
Packing his bags about to ribbit on
Ugh huh, whatever!
Bounce then nigga
Knowing I regret the decision
I'm gon' miss ya
Love is funny
It gets cold in the summer and winter
Ya heart just wanna cuddle up
Make up sex with a nigga, ewwwww
I promise baby I'm still deep in love with you
Yep, Yep I know the MO, this is how we do
Up and down rollercoaster, too emotional
Got me feeling sick inside
I only like it when we ride
In the bedroom like a coupe, yeah
Arguments we loop, ugh
Going in circles I wanna circle back with him, ugh
Back when we were friends, yeah them happy days
I really miss my boo boo hoping he don't stay way
Cause that's my

[Musiq Soulchild & 9th Wonder:]
Cause that's my rollercoaster love
My rollercoaster love
And we go
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, Love, Love Love
Love, Love Love love

Cause that's my rollercoaster love
My rollercoaster love
And we go
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Up and down, Up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, Love, Love Love
Love, Love Love love

// U Used 2 Love Me //

I remember
I remember when
You used to like me
I used to love you
You used to hold me
I remember when
You used to trust me
I used to trust you
Now we don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
We don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
I remember

The hardest thing to do is to break your heart
Yeah, you broke mine and I forgave that part
It's like I woke up one day and I ain't love you no more
Now everything you do gets on my nerves a little bit more
I gave you everything I had, I can't give you no more
It's like there's levels to this thang and we ain't on the same floor
And now I feel like Florence, I gotta open the door
And walk thru it, I don't know when I got influenced for sure
Maybe mama gave me too much advice for me to keep going
I saw ya mama out she huggest my neck and kept on going
I know she missed me
Tell her I miss her, for sure
And imma always love you forever ex boyfriend
But I ain't in love no more
No, I don't love you no more
I don't love you no more

// Knock On My Door //

Love thy neighbor the bible say
Watching from the window he and homies all congregate
Good lord you fine, uhm that all imma say
Son got my head wrapped up like mama sway, or mama Tate
Come hug my neck, namaste
With all due respect, seven sons like Andre
We should spend a whole week together to conversate
Just knock on my door baby boy I'll accommodate
I could use some good company like I'm good on my taxes
I ain't tryna be a senior just earning my bachelors
Aye, I could tell you I don't need too much practice
My heart ain't hard to open it ain't wrapped in no plastic
I know you out here like rappers tryna make good on yo money
Either way one day you gonna have to count on black woman
So if you choose to come by I won't leave you outside
Just knock on my door a couple of times

Knock on, knock on, knock on my door, knock on my door
Knock on my door sometimes
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes
Knock on, knock on, knock on my door
Whewwwww
Knock on my door sometimes

Every woman needs some affection
Need to be kissed, hugged, told she's loved it cures depression
I talkin bout you, most nights I lay around restless
I only get by day to day by counting my blessing
Tryna get your attention hope see me in these leggings
Know I was raised better
What you fish with, you catch
I got better bait
That ain't for debate
I still proud of my cake
I got cake cake
Apple bottom looking for a snake
Knowing Imma sin if you ever come up in my place
You my first place
All these other others they a waste
I know a winner when I see him
If you ever round my way
Knock on my door and we can chill and talk about your day
That ain't nothing to do
Single woman home alone all that's missing is you
We ain't got curfew we grown
So tell me what's taking you so long
Come around my way and maybe we can play if

Knock on, knock on, knock on my door, knock on my door
Knock on my door sometimes

// Jesus Coming //

[Amber Navran:]
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home
I'm going

[Rapsody:]
I spent way too much time tryna fit in
"It's time to go"
Laying on this flo' dying flashing thru my life and everybody said it's cool but Where dey?
"It's time to go"
Telling me we young and that we only gon live once and this the only way to fully enjoy the party
"Damn near all youuuu... home"
But I was having fun before I ever took the risk now they bangin on my chest telling me it's
"Time to go home"
Thinkin' bout my family, Know this one gon hurt eem honest
Damn I'm sorry mama but I gotta
"It's Time to go home"
Tell grandmama I love her, If you see my baby please hug her
Cause these demons said I gotta go
"It's time to go"
Save Jordan's for my brother, tell little sister, your daughter, peer pressure is coming
Its real mama
"Damn near all YOUUU"
None of it make it cool
But it's her decision to choose
Just remember me when you it's yo time
"Time to go home"

[Amber Navran:]
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet

Going home

[Rapsody:]
Brought my baby out to play today
"It's time to go"
Thinking when I saw them arguing I knew that won't it good and so I told her come on baby
"It's time to go"
Now we lying right here dying and it hurts I couldn't save her why they'd have to shoot my baby, God
"Damn near all of youuuuuu"
Over colors she would color with tomorrow I know they'll all forget about me and her once it's time to
"Time to go hooooome"
Bout her building blocks just yesterday
"Time to go"
So excited to PLAY but now there's blood soaking our clothes and we ain't have nothing do with it
"Time to go"
Why they have to trip we were enjoying the day but they had to go and ruin shit
"Damn near all YOUUU"
Now we laying on the ground and everything around me fading cause it's
"Time to go"
I was having fun then mama said its
"Time to go"
Then I heard thang go bang bang- bang bang bang -bang now we lying out here it's time for us

She grabbed me tried run but it was far too late and now we staring at the sun she waiting on me
"Damn near all you"
I hope you don't forget us and that I pray God forgive you when it's your time to go
"Time to go"

[Amber Navran:]
Sweet sounds of hellos and I'm so undistracted
I remember winds, and long goodbyes and ashes
I will find my strength at last
My mind captive
I'm going
Home

[Rapsody:]
We was staring at the sun too
We was shooting at each other now we both dying too
I got a family and I know he got a family too
I'm praying to my God and he praying to his too
He fighting for his family and I'm fighting for mine too
Money, oil, land, gold the only plan was to make it back safe with both my feet and hands but
It's time to go home
Well now I'm on my way back going (it's time to go)
They'll give my wife a flag and tell my sons how brave their dad was
And when I make it back home (it's time to go)
I hope they save the letters, pics and now how much I wished
I wish it wasn't time for me to
But know I left with em on my heart, I ain't want no purple heart
I'm sorry baby but it's time for me (it's time to go)

[Amber Navran:]
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home
I'm going

I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
