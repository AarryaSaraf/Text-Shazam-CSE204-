// 12 Problems //

Yeah, y'all bogus
Real goofy
I ain't never lost focus
Nah, y'all bogus

Yeah, the dark flesh Bob Mar'
Speak mine, what you thought dem 99 problems was?
War on drugs, legality
They got us on fallacies
Resorted in casualties
I was supposed to resort in the Maldives
Now, we in the rallies, now
Boxin' in IG now, boxin' like Ali
In the memory pourin' Hennessy and Bumbu shot reachin' for the ID
Get off my neck, nigga, 'less you a Cuban link ('less you a Cuban link)
I think like the Cubans (Like the Cubans)
Think you'll never get Assata back
We got ya back T Mallory
Carry on like a Prada bag
My dogs wit like they quarter lab
In the backseat of a patrol car, that's luck they ain't call the cornerer
Should be hall of fame, corridor (Corridor)
The way we run it back (The way we run it back)
You'd think it's 63 (63)
I'm thinkin' 60 3's (60 3's)
Hunnid and eighty degrees
Get ya shit straight, mr. police
Did the same thing to Cochise
Did the same thing to Rhaheem
Did the same thing in our reality, y'all bogus

I got 99 problems and 12 still the biggest
I got 99 problems
Baton, bullets, triggers
I got 99 problems and 12 still the biggest
I got 99 problems
Baton, bullets, triggers

Death come in 3's
Every month March, every month March
33 Nip, gotta a heavy heart
His killer in jail, y'all don't get that part
Cops kill lawfully, no remorse
I don't wanna hear arguments no more about black on black
When white on white
They kill they own too
And cops the only ones who ain't accountable
Black men in jail for a ounce or two
For us it's punishable (And they still ain't free)
Look at the weed business (Look at the weed business)
White man makin' booku (Booku) in Timbuktu
Hope they praying at the mosque for us
When you create your own
You don't care what they top floor is
Y'all thirteenth superstition
We get a thirteenth amendment
We get a shot back without a shot back, take the shot back and vaccines
All we see is murder, murder, murder, murder
And you wonder why we gotta disorder?
Anxiety, ya die not passing sobriety
Atlanta, Georgia, that's some shit

I got 99 problems and 12 still the biggest
I got 99 problems
Baton, bullets, triggers
I got 99 problems and 12 still the biggest
I got 99 problems
Baton, bullets, triggers

You're never seen as a victim (Never seen as a victim)
Watch you run and walk miles in Michael Vick Tims
Been dogged out (Been dogged), no paws in house
No daddy, no papi, who the kids gonna call now? (Who the kids gonna call?)
But you steady killin' they fathers left and right, our brothers
They tryna take you out (They can't take us out)
We don't die, we multiply
Black man, black woman, 12

// Afeni (Remix) //

Ooh... yeah

(Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
Now since we all)

[Rapsody:]
My brothers (My brothers), I love you (I love you)
I hate to know some of you treat us like Glover (Glover)
Black card revoked, maybe you could use Discover (Discover)
Define yourself, do you feel the same way 'bout your mother? (Mother)
Do you overlook our beauty, but you lovin' on all the others (Others)
Hope you teach your daughters all to stay away from suckas
Like yourself if you don't love yourself
I'm so Southern (Southern), I was taught to feed the soul with or without hot ovens
Here's a plate, know your hate come from a black man struggle (Struggle)
We all in the same shape, so I know I fit your puzzle (Puzzle)
Either way, we got your back, we only pray you'll be our muscle (Pray you'll be our muscle)
Strength in the times we all overcome with trouble
Every day we pullin' doubles for ourself and home (For ourself and home)
My mom and daddy taught me, early on, protect your own (Protect your own)
We never stopped lovin' you, so turn your love back on (Your love back on)
And I pray you feel the same way as that 2Pac song
We ain't your hoes or your bitches, trophies, or meant for pimpin'
Recognize a gift from God outweighs a birthday or a Christmas
To protect our lives, you gon' take it to the limit? (You gon' take it to the limit?)
Rib of my rib, do you still feel us in ya?

(Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?)

[PJ Morton & D Smoke:]
I don't know where I would be (Be)
If you weren't here with me (Me)
If you don't hear anybody else sayin'
Please know you're appreciated ('Ated)
The way you walk, way you talk so fine (Fine)
And ooh, you got a brilliant mind (Brilliant mind)
There ain't nobody better (Better)
Each and every one of you matter to me (Listen)

[D Smoke:]
May I present this conversation starter (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Just picture a single mister, tryna to raise a daughter
Envision him planning summer trips, take her to raging waters
Challenges of July made this father afraid of August
Martyr, he'd gladly be presented with danger
And every scar that he could prevent was a gift to his angel
Mr. Incredible
She put him on pedestal
'Cause words of affirmation from her father were medical
Now picture that same hero deranged and calling her out her name
Talk is either a toxin or tonic, monitor whether or not you servin' elixirs or painting pictures of pain
Our position protected, that coward shit is for lames
Listen
Because I got my game from a woman and my name from a woman
I'd be willing to change for a woman
I'd pull a couple strings for a woman
Go ahead and make it a fair exchange for a woman
Listen
Women are gifted with the capacity to make something of nothing
That's nothing short of miraculous
Her love is a gift and that's likely right where her passion is
Her touch and her kiss can't be taken lightly, let's rally for our women

(We all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?)
(Dear Women)

[PJ Morton:]
I know I wouldn't be nothing (Nothing)
Without you by my side (Side)
You have always been the savior, you're the closest thing to God
So, I just want to thank you (Thank ya), for bein' so good to me
And I apologize, for not always bein' what I'm supposed to be (Be)
I just wanted to write this letter (Letter), I promise, I'm gonna do better

I don't know where I would be (Be)
If you weren't here with me (Me)
If you don't hear anybody else sayin'
Please know you're appreciated ('Ated)
The way you walk, way you talk so fine (Fine)
And ooh, you got a brilliant mind (Brilliant mind)
There ain't nobody better (Better)
Each and every one of you matter to me (To me, yeah)

// Day One Friend //

I got a Day One like Day-Day that pull up on a Friday
Like get yo' ass up we bout to party
Another one that's always praying for me cause she godly
And a few that throw hands in my name if you try me
Dara know my dirt and she keep it under rug
Kash tell it like it is
Pat used to give me cash when I ain't have a cent
Netta taught me how to pop the wop
Nique held me down when my temp got hella hot
Joya hugged me tight when I cried over dumb dudes
Marcus always lied when I used to skip school
Almost got arrested, we was actin' a fool
Few Day Ones I don't even talk to
If you don't know my mama then you just a debut
Newcomer trying to act like you really paid dues
You ain't seen me at my worst
Ain't dropped everything when I called
Had genuine love since the first Day One

Ohh
I've been there I've been there I've been broken like you
Changed my hair what I wear and my whole attitude
When you're strong but you're scared you've got so much to prove
It takes time

My day one friend
If you want to party
All you do is call me
I will be there
My day one friend
When you're feeling lonely
You don't have to worry
I have been there

Celebrate, celebrate
Caviar and your smile
Pour the wine, more champagne
Tell non-sinners we tried
Good cigars, single malt
We've no secrets to hide
From each other
From each other
Oh yeah

Took a drive up the coast
Dipped my toes in the bay
Turned it off all the things
Still to do and to say
Pour some out, a Salud
If you never knew pain then what's pleasure

My day one friend
If you want to party
All you do is call me
I will be there
My day one friend
When you're feeling lonely
You don't have to worry
I have been there

Don't I know

// Dust To Diamonds //

I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay (talk that talk)
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning (yeah)
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

Turned a quarter to a quarter milly
Went from dark days in the black
I ain't Lauryn Hill but still the path I took was hella Hilly
A queen within her palace
Every stone you threw look what it built me
This for every baller that they court I hope you look to
Billie Jean King
My gloves swing I made em see stars and thrillers
Laila Ali
Ran the track like Flo Jo nail me to the crosses
X Games
Kelly Clark's
Pipe down
Made em do it
Arenas scream Serena
This like Jesus music

Never seen nobody body like she bodied
Wit that body, Jesus Christ
Counting all the crosses
Diana Taurasi hella nice
Veins filled wit hella ice
So why I need the jewelry
I put a spin on everything
I'm Krista Yamaguchi

I turned dust into diamonds
And turned diamonds
Just Like Dot
I'm (richer son) but not enough
They still sock her price
And never foot the bill though we've defeated that
Twice
Times twice
4 on Abbey road
This is what it field like
Soccer

I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

Gimme my bread and
Put the ham on
Hammon, this ain't a Spur
Of the moment
I get my Hamm on
M-I-A
Jam on
A Heat check
Like Allison Fe-lex
Gimme respect
Screaming we next
Osaka Naomi
The pressure was on me
I made diamonds
Outta Roc checks
A bar flex
CunningHam
My cunning ham
I waited
Remember all the roads that they gated
I skated
You should join her
Like Jackie do
Whatever occur, see it through
And up the checks

Asked for equally pay
And they dug less
Douglas Gabby Simone
Only ones we respect on floors
Their routines ain't like yours
We ride waves
They used oars
Stick and stones don't break bones
Diamonds coming out my pores
We ain't pour

We complex
Like diamonds
We got necks
These bodies ain't just objects
I object
Can't judge me
I hold court like
Sue Bird
So whoever needed the jury
Made diamonds outta two words
Don't die man
Just get yours

Be careful of those stones you're throwing
That's what keeps me going
Going I

I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

I turn dust to diamonds

// Eve Gene //

Ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh

Black woman
Unprotected in this world
Is she loved?
Is she treasured?
Is she heard?
Oh black woman
Are you wanted in this world?
Oh black woman
Are you valued in this world?
They try to look you over like they don't care
They say they want your body but not your hair
Oh they tell you change your nose
Keep your skin too fair
But everybody knows it
Deep down they're scared

Cuz ohhh black girl
They owe you apology
Ohhh black girl
Don't give em your energy
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society

Talk
They call it evening cause it's black
Eve, mitochondrial gene imitating my behind how I fit my jeans
Black don't lack
Needed henrietta
I'm singing erykah
Healer. I feel her
What's a king if he ain't got a Coretta?
Ask hakeem
For a queen
He'd fight a lion
Y'all stay lying tryna lower our self-esteem
Feel unseen, unprotected
Brainwashed brothers
Learn from the real ones that check you because they love us

How you hate someone that look like ya motha?
Guess she shoulda used a rubber
But I don't judge her
Knowing each of us
Just tryna make it
They take it
Too beautiful to change our faces
This beauty so contagious
No cap
Braided our hair as a map
To freedom from racists
Innovative
Nothing bout this genealogy is basic
Where da roses, where da applause, we deserve praises
Without a black women you'd still be stuck in the matrix

Cuz ohhh black girl
They owe you apology
Ohhh black girl
Don't give em your energy
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society
You're the healer of the world
You're the healer of society

// Iconic //

I think I'm Mary motherfuckin' Blige, niggas try to play me stupid
Bitches actin' up for free, I only act up for the movies
I'm still the Queen, I've been a G before I put on Gucci
Love me or hate me, y'all stay fake mad more than Lil Boosie
Ask my migos, I ain't got ego, but I might be bougie
But it's mixed with hood, I still put hot sauce on my two piece
My weave poppin', I got so many options
I might go blonde today, or black it out like Onyx
Might take it back to bucket hats, all of my styles iconic
We black, we speak Ebonics
Everything I'm on poppin'
All week long, we mobbin'
Somebody hit up Fivi

We only talk deposits

Streets love me, niggas sing my praises, throw the towels in
I don't sweat the drama, all my homegirls bad like Mees and Kim
Tribe, don't be trying them, you're messin' with a lions dens
Broken hearts just made me richer, turn my exes into crosses
Bitch, this a God body, made wins out of all my losses
I throw on the Timbs and hoops on the roof singing, "You are all I"
Need this
S6, picture me rollin', sea sick
Never worried 'bout a wave, the ocean, I'm the whole shit
If you insecure, just say that, you ain't gotta hate, chick
No more hateration, go through all the stages of my life
Came out feeling so amazing, I don't even talk a price

It's big, big drip, it's so iconic
Do your thing, lil' mama

// Imagination //

Hold your breath, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Hold your breath, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three
Make a wish, count to three

Yeah, imagination
Oh No
Rap Diddy
Yeah, imagination
Imagination, imagination

Uh
Every day lo-lost in imaginings
Going with the flow like paddling
Was never ever part of my little mighty scheme
Had a dream to be like dude off the gravel team
Roc-a-Fella, now rock it like gasoline
Matches for it like slashes, dreams happening
Fat kid fastening
Ramadan, uh, how I hunger for the crackling
Pop sounds see me travelling
Champ ships since I was a small kid, doing somersault flips
I was battling and imagine every player with a sword under tongue slayer
Pirate team
Lost in imagining
Imagining is now wanna live like a lavish queen
Childhood dreams
Now it's real life, flow is what I'm mastering

Yeah, imagination, imagination
Imagination, yeah, imagination
Imagination

Never play doll, tea partying
But I will serve a couple words flow startling
Harboring skill modelling, the lottery, pics
New Jerz from the bricks still following
The night mini mites on my mind taking flight
On a kite, damn, ain't life ice-ning
With the sweet dreams that I'm iphelling on, leaning on
Bet I slept, every Don Cyphering
Woke tightening, strike pens, lightning, writening
Imagining that I flow like water for the Vikenings
Lost in imagining, kings in my eyes of the side, grass never green, green
See a whole another colour, see a whole another colour scheme
So with that imagining I can be anything
Shooting from the stars to the pistol rings
Stuck in imagining, yeah still I dream

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Want to change the world?
There's nothing to it

Yeah, imagination, imagination
Imagination, yeah, imagination

// Lonely Thoughts (Remix) //

I rain, I rain, I rain, I rain

[Rapsody:]
Penny for a beggar, beg to differ
These just my lonely thoughts that sometimes get off with some liquor
So I don't drink so much no more at war with my own picture
What you thought it was? Cause I ain't perfect as the dove in scriptures
Tight as two sisters but my favorite color black
They say the color purple royal soil on my back
From the war that I been fighting just to make it off the map
I was waiting for the sun to set, they intrigued with the black
I guess the pitch is like my soul
Worn out just like my Fo's
I took the blue pill yesterday
The key to all my goals
Going over songs we like and songs we don't
Don't wanna fall short as the gnomes and I have yet to visit Rome
24 inches how we used to dream of chrome
Last year my sister moved from New Orleans and she ain't need no loans
We light up like the scones when talkin money trees
How you don't eat pork but smoke holy on tobacco? Weed
I never breath, another breed, Q, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Check the rhyme It's just my time to kill It like the purge this spring
Deep as the valleys in the Philippines and up in Cali
They say this tape is like an album
Threw one in the galaxy all for free
Magna carter I been part of
My independent ass motherfucker they couldn't water
Down look around the takeover dun took over
And we been doing shit that you average rapper can't shoulder
So, what's next I suspect your death
Welcome to the game where we trained to never follows refs
Lot of great players, but we as better as a team
You learned that watching Miami and the spurs just this spring
Scary as the ring in the well
On the scale I weigh like the Bronson or Adele
I'm shell as full jacket metal
Madame I replicated the summer of Sam, damn
Kill at ran-damn (random) I'm like VanDam stuck in a damn
Damn, who is the killa? With agility
Flow bend like that around Anguilla
Got the skill of thriller
Came from underground to get a mill or Two
Everyday I've wrote, it seemed to wanna rain a few
I guess I'll reign for you, Philly to NY
Just to wet you up I'm tear ducts to a dry eye
My my what he told me reciting OBI, Kenobi
"You'll be the death of me solely"
I told him showly, I agree I'm Ali, cross um like Doji
Sting like wasps I serve um losses they lowley
Call me young achilles cause I snap on these like Kobe Now
Back to talking bout my day it went smoothly
I woke up hella early, last night watched a movie
And compared it to my life like Tootie boobies, the come up, like the sun up, when ya son up mornings crying for juices
Adolescents
Never stress um
Developed I bless um
Denaun thanks for the blessing
One of the best in the game
I still remain, outside still writing in the rain, I reign

[Chance the Rapper:]
Why don't you come home at night no more, no more
Why can't you see past a thing, no more

Yeah I see the gun but it's a pellet
Yeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate
They sayin Acid was an album retail it
I said I got way too much soul for me to sell it
That's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders
Said save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing
I'm a little too hard to be slept on
I'm a little too sharp to be stepped on
A little too Pac for the septum
I'm so pretty I make mirrors blush
I spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust
I'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone
On the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us
There's a metaphor if I expound
There's a better score in the next round
Me and raps go together like donuts and fresh ground
Coffee, I'm awfully softly spoken
In Autumn, fall leaf clovin
My posters on dry wall and my banners are star spangled
My demons get charred, mangled, Chancelor the Archangel
I don't pray for chart singles
I grab life by the ankle like Kurt Angle
And ask it if it's ticklish
Ask me if that's ridiculous
I'm a meticulous fickle dude
That just happens to spit a little bit
And you can tell I rapped this off my phone
Cause you can hear that ringtone in the background but I'm in the zone

[Big K.R.I.T.:]
I can't call this rapping, more like relapsing
Don't feel like talking if you metaphorically speaking
My nigga told me all those similes that don't be reaching
And those beats you rather sequence are leaving
We should be preaching teaching kids something
Maybe the ones and twos or how you flew the coup
During duck season
We out here dying like everyone said motherfuck breathing
The hood ain't known for angels so motherfuck grieving
Who can we trust either?
Well I can't trust neither, friend or foe
Cause it sure as the rise of sun they'll cut you like ninja swords
Beware of the drunken masses that tattled by business woes
For the very villains that you hone your skills of killing for
The Geishas that you favour pretend like they love your kind
Rather piece of your kingdom than a piece of your mind
In a world of sightseers, love is blind
These lonely thoughts pass the time on my way to Zion

// Pray Momma Don't Cry //

[Bilal:]
Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was the case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
Sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love

[Rapsody:]
Gun to your back 'cause you black kids in the whip
Seven to his back different than when we ride for Kaepernick
At seventeen, a son dies, murder was the case
Time flies still we never can forget the face
It's mourning nights knowin' Breonna ain't gettin' another morning
Watchin' black death, our murder shouldn't be normal
Mercy mercy what a world our black children are born into
Black is king we pray that scars will heal, still a noose
Wounds out the womb, targets on our back like birth marks are tombs
And now these all black for the funerals
Following families at the funeral
Carried by six but we loved by the universe
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained street bodies glitter and gold
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained street bodies glitter and gold, kings

[Bilal:]
Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was the case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
The sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love

[Rapsody:]
Pray for me, death in these streets
Red blood, these slugs, murder police
I know you fear my black is king
Please hug my momma tell her she's my queen
And the [?] should I not come home
Tell my daddy I held my own
Intimidated by my black my throne
They pulled that chrome under the black domes (bow)
Wounds out the womb, targets on our back like birth marks are tombs
And now these all black for the funerals
Following families at the funeral
Carried by six but we loved by the universe
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained streets bodies glitter and gold
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained streets bodies glitter and gold, kings

[Bilal:]
Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was a case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
Sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love
It's the sound of love
It's the sound of love

// Redblue //

[J.I.D:]
Uh, red blood, red blood drops, Red was a young light skin nigga from the block
Red blood he thug he was a product of his pops
Pop a lock pop a pop-pop-pop a nigga for some guap
Red blood drops, red blood drop, red dropped right out of school he's a lefty with the Glock
Red got into the usual maneuvering the block red, white, green, blue, red, next steady watching
Red blood drops finally got shot but he didn't die it only made him wilder
And revenge is an easy way for him to gain power, game over, gunpowder
Women crying holding flowers for dead, Red
Roses are red, violets are blue, violence forget violence annihilate your crew
Silence among tyrants terrorising, Y'all niggas banging on your web browser we can't allow ya
To infiltrate the shit that we been kickin' since the slaves
Still better than my demons tryna lock us in a cage ok, ok, ok
I see how we gon play less, said that they reserved a seat for who play for mayhem
D-d-dayum, in the nighttime, and the AM and the body red it's flay 'em
Fuck the red, the white, the blue, only areas are grey
Red never drop his flag and he banging to this day or to the day he D.O.A
Even if he pray he probably won't be ok but fuck it

[Rapsody:]
But fuck it (fuck it)
He read my mind, he probably won't live a day past 28, 29
Legally drinks, in a wink roller-rink date propose, and she break down crying, toast red wine
Count down the days 'till the baby's a full-blown now
Momma's a grand-momma she proud, look at her child
Watching this child grow up, kiss your wife when she come home from work
Dream job, best friend's still involved, hanging late nights
Reminiscing 'bout the red, blue blue, red red
Ok but daddy's still got life, child first game, first name, he is every milestone 'till he grown, graduating
And he vacationin' after retirement, with his wife alone somewhere in North Ireland
That's your life I know that everyone desire it but how we gon live long as they keep firing
That red blue, blue red pill, pill real real, do you live reality or are you in the matrix still?

Man nah, nah, nah, rap you gotta come harder than that man
Stop playing with these niggas man, go ahead and give it to em
Really rap it

[Rapsody:]
Uh, when you confident, fuck compliments nigga I got so much steam I don't ever hide facts
I came on my momma not a wrinkle on me nigga, when you straight as me, fuck niggas can't understand that
Talk a lot'a shit but they ain't talkin' bout shit watch me scare the shit out these niggas tallest in the back
Wash my hands show I'm really done with niggas if you got a problem then I hope it come with luck
Can't make a couple diamonds without the homie [?] we already been the future without the gram bruh
I'm back in L.A on my bullshit like cops that pull quick on niggas that just happen to be black
I don't believe you like we don't believe that, get so much respect I could rock a blue L.A cap
Welcome home, baby girl where you been at? I'll dodge your bullshit, matador, they mad at that
But I just laugh at these niggas, hahahahahaha

// She Bad //

Bad, she's bad, bad
Okie dokie
She bad

Can't play nice, this my life, this is life
Roll my dice, who want fight? I might go Mike Tys
Won't fail twice, pay my price, why my sun so bright
Diamonds nice, ain't got charm, my world feel like ice
Use my arms, I ain't armed but I got her, right?
You the type to run your mouth, get knocked out on sight
Bithc I'm bad, been through shit but I bounce right back
Laugh, then I do the dab, leave you deadbeat like his dad
Huh, here I go, hitch feel like a pistol blow
Leila Ali against the ropes, fight my way to the top floor
Been through the dark, this a nice glow
Mode always survival, I aim to take our your vidals
Yeah, I put that on the bible

She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Yeah, she bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bitch, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad

Oh shit, got my focus back
Oh shit, we don't doubkle back
I'm so rich I need a duffle bag
And an armour truck that's armour backed
Got big dreams, need big rings
'Til it ding ding, and the big ring
Money on my mind and it's uzi pink
Put the drop on him, lucas mink
Metaphor for a knockout
Blows feel like the top down
Two M's, I don't need a crown
That's the Meagan flow, they insecure now
My skin color, Pac brown
If they durag, we gon' knock 'em down
Make 'em studder back, like a chopper sound
Tensed up like a cop around
They say scared money don't make money
M, y momma ain't make a dummy
Gotta fight for it, can't take it for me
I shit like when the day is coming

Say sumn, betcha won't (I wish you would)
But if you do (What nigga?)
Bitch, it's on

Get yo' beat down like Fruity Loops
If you want smoke like hooty-hoo
I'm a outcast, this a musical
Let it hum to you like Jigga do
Let's square it up like a Rubix cube
The respect ain't mutual
Ya'll disrespect, I'll diss ya too
So the beat down is additional

She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Yeah, she bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bitch, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad
