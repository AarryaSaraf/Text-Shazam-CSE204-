Album: ThankHERNow

// Black Girl Jedi //

[Rapsody:]
Need a big black four door body to push
Night time running through the streets, Reggie Bush
Car dashing through lights the color of kush
Run into my baby he could feel on my tush
Jedi flow better than the veterans know
Or average perceived like weed they never grow
Weak for weak tides need [?] coco
Compose rhymes with the signs of a J-hov
Step through it a new jet yeah I step in slow
West Snipes called, take over, double my flow
A diamond girl, Leslie, I shine brighter
Every magazine from XXL, Source, your writer
Lighter fluid, sparks, something similar to read
Robbin' every bit of attention that's been given to me
Thank 'em now if you please, Mayweather touch me never
Forever rap shit, y'all should treasure and see, Miss R.A.P
Flow a [?] no half rapper, fuck these niggas that acting
Ain't hanging with me, another plane I'm on
Con-Air, the baddest in the bunch where I belong, Jedi

[Heather Victoria:]
Black girl Jedi
Feel the force no pressure, that said I
Keep it hot, we b-girls forever
Hip hop on top won't stop forever

[Rapsody:]
J-Skywalker and I'm back in the flesh
Just when you thought it was safe to address
Your dream I came and demolished the scene
No room to intervene I got it padlocked with Jean
[?] trust, niggas ain't touching the smart
Apart from all life sees the most involved
In the red zone, one play away from my calls
Nicole, Richie from the records I sold shit
I'm far from that, maybe only 50 and hold
And ho they can't stomach me John and O
Well they ain't well, in feelings like braille
12 play ok I make them rotate, compel
No joke, Chapelle shit, they better know who I am
Black girl Jedi back with the force and the jam

[Heather Victoria:]
Black girl Jedi
Feel the force no pressure, that said I
Keep it hot, we b-girls forever
Hip hop on top won't stop forever

// One Time //

[Tab-One:]
Kooley High. 9th Wondera. What's the deal brah?

One time for your mind, one time
One time for your mind, one time
One time for your mind, one time
It's so fresh, it's so fly
(One time!)

One time for your mind, yes y'all it's the T.A
B. to the One, run son and tell the DJ
Put that K. double O. L. High on replay
Unlike airlines, we fly with no delay
Non stop hip hop, can't cop on Ebay
So ready or not, yo you can't knock what we play
We make it rain when we run together
So you can come stand under my umbrella
I am here At Last like a song from Etta
Had to take my time, get my shit together
So y'all can stop buggin' me like Citronella
Got my Salt and my Pepa like Spinderella
Now my flavor's just right like grits with cheddar
It's that down south sweet tea, truth ya never
Ever heard, that's my word like groups of lettuce
K. High till I die and flow forever

If you want the fresh, fly, look to the sky
Just make the call (Oooh Ooooh!)
Kooley High
We'll be right there with the beats and the rhymes
One time for your mind
(One time!)

If you want the fresh, fly, look to the sky
Just make the call (Oooh Ooooh!)
Kooley High
We'll be right there with the beats and the rhymes
One time for your mind
(One time!)

[Rapsody:]
One time for the Fugees, respect that smalls
Kept 'em over the limit, drunk and I can do bars
Advanced placement, my entertainment company will call
Like 9th, 'Tay, Kooley jam will represent all
My Carolina folk family in the dark Ray Charles
Spittin' until you aching, beyond Christopher Paul's
More than anniversaries and birthdays I fall in line
Some scribe to get to the bottom of it, one time
Megazine, zine, I write on the weekly I mean
I mean any poligy, often marry the ring
In live direct, yo I love this rappin' to death
Hugh Hef', I don't play boy, word to that nigga Leroy
Six months suppose to be girls [?]
I keep [?], seesaw, jigsaw puzzle
How she make another heater?
That B-Girl good
Couldn't deny me one time like Peter could

If you want the fresh, fly, look to the sky
Just make the call (Oooh Ooooh!)
Kooley High
We'll be right there with the beats and the rhymes
One time for your mind
(One time!)

If you want the fresh, fly, look to the sky
Just make the call (Oooh Ooooh!)
Kooley High
We'll be right there with the beats and the rhymes
One time for your mind
(One time!)

[Charlie Smarts:]
Oh no, not again, it's another verse, hate me
But wait a second man, I'm chillin' with the first lady
They said you need more than a purse to persuade me
So the beat's she straight jackin' and in a word 'crazy'
That's why we don't stuff that you don't
Feelin' so Semetic, I'm tryin' to get to Judo
So you knows I had to kick it, put my feets on a feature
I'm seeing sucrose, it don't get no sweeter
Bitch your necks got the nectar
Leg's got a lecture
Feelin' what I'm sayin', well my texts got the texture
It ain't quite polyester and I ain't got a wrinkle yet
Acting like a printer, grab my pad then the ink and jet
Doo doo doo doo
Get your fax/facts straight, I'm that great
Separate the cheese with my family
Stack it face to face till it act gay
Just saying I'm happy boy
When I get up on the tracks they going
My shit is fresh

(Ooooh Ooooh!)
(One Time!)
(Ooooh Ooooh!)
(One Time!)

[Phonte:]
Yo. New Tiggalo, new Tiggalo, new Tiggalo

Rap ditty with the rapper 'Tay
Pull up a chair let's rap a taste
Get real intimate with my Texas Instrument
Flow that y'all hoes can't calculate
So fuck what you thought, I apply brute force
Like old school niggas rockin' FabergÃ©
These hoes aggravate, me till my words coagulate
Not for the accolades, I do it to remind these niggas
Stay in your place like you been held back a grade
And spit the truth from your own heart
Cause we them '88 babies like Tone Stark
They screamin' "Kill him" but yet I still swim by myself
In a sea full of piranhas, a lone shark
Stroking against the current and at alarming rate
Like a theft deterrent
Want respect then earn it
The spice of life in one line
A lil' salt, a lil' pepper, some sage and one thyme/time

Yeah, let that boy cook. Let that boy cook! I swag, I chop I chef! Let that boy cook!

// Extra Extra //

[Mac Miller:]

Couple cigarettes and...
Iight, iight, iight, iight I'll rap. Fine!

Hey, hey, yeah
It's young Mac-a-bee and Rapsody
Tell these mother fuckers that they haven't heard the last of me
All over the map like the latitude
Rhyming with an attitude
This is the beginning, you ain't even got to chapter 2!
I don't got to battle you, im better than you is
4 year old bars, you ain't worthy of new shit
Corey and Topanga, you can watch the boy meet world
With the homie Rapsody, uhh return of the B girl
Its easy as fuck, all I need is a good beat
Fuck me for who I am, but love me for who I could be
And its simple when you living like I am
Cause I remember grinding, spitting for 5 fans
And now I got damn near a million boy
Oh I ain't doing shit? You can kill that noise
I got a sniper type flow yeah I'll take aim
Cause the boy be riding tracks like a freight train
Wishing I could have Mac Miller produced by J Dilla
Saluting all the legends that gone, just know we miss ya
Extra Extra read all about it
Hard beats and boom bap, I'd die without this Hip Hop

Extra extra read all about it
Hard beats of boom bap, I'd die without this hip hop
Yeah I die without this hip hop, this hip hop
Extra extra read all about it
Extra extra read all about it

[Rapsody:]
Late night chilling not really high off shit
Can't afford it, I got work to hit with no benefits
And a car to drive that don't really go too fast
Pushing it to the limit 'till the day that I crash
Yo I'm up nights in studio, working for pay
Trying to make some classic music that my children can play
For they kids, kids influence, they can reincarnate
Me and they lines and they raps that they someday will make
Yeah, chilling with Mac, ten after two, just have to do
Finish rocking the stage
That's how hard work pays, I choose top ten, eight thousand hoorays
Got they hands high as tight ropes, Janell Monay
So I spend days and nights on mics the life I wanted to
And I can have it too if I'm just killing the booth
Niggas ain't get enough yeah we back in the cut
April 1st, fool's day, but yo this ain't a bluff
It's the return of the duo, as you know as the illest on scene
To make it go, hip hop to let you know
Rap with Mac Miller, yeah we back in the spot
So one time for all the lovers, yeah one time for hip hop

Extra, extra, read all about it
Hip hop, what would I do without it?
Extra extra, read all about it
Turn it up and play me in your Audi

[Halo:]
On the track, frivolous shift, Nascar, follow my drift
Jeff Gordon recording the cure for the boredom
Priceless can't afford them don't need you to reward them
I feel super, blame it on the Buddha
Cats nice but they still getting neutered
Flow champion meet me in the pantheon buzzing like infinity and beyond
Jamla rep hardest rebuild on what you tarnished
Or some power I harness eating like a 5 star meal with the garnish
Look I'm the end if you start this paper and pencil you fucking sketch artist
Most Dope flows from mac rap and H A L O making dudes pump their brakes
We're tired of them big bully rappers make gimmicks and silly factors
I get it you really actors reading the script upside down and backwards
Like my honda is a hill billy tractor and the â¦ the farm
All I do is plant seeds and park it in the barn real vivid forced to deal with it

My man, extra extra read all about it
Dyslexics too struggle about it
Extra extra read all about it
Most Dope and Jamla know all about it

// Baby Yeah! //

(Rapsody, Marsha Ambrosius)
(Let's go. Yeah)
You make me go
You make me say
(You make me go)
(You make me say)
Yeah yeah yeah

I'll be here nightime, speeding in chariots
Plans later on, late night at the Marriott
Walked in, slow tunes playing on Sirius
Seriously, going down tonight, no barriers
Kissing on my neck, masaging my areas
He's a real good man, 'cause he really take care of her
Sofa to to the bed, pick me up and carry her
Sweet touches on exterior, you make me wanna

Boy, you make me say "baby yeah"
You make me go
Yeah yeah yeah

Your lips down my spine got me hot
Baby, you know I really like that a lot
A tender touch, far from turning me off
Warm bath bubbles and strawberry Smirnoff
Sharing desserts, chocolaty frost
Warmed up your body, affection and all
'Cause when you gone, missing you, Aaron Hall
I'm glad you're home, 'cause I like when you do it like that

Boy, you make me say "baby yeah"
You make me go
Yeah yeah yeah

// So Be It //

[Big KRIT:]
What's happenin' Rapsody?

[Rapshody:]
What's up, Big KRIT? Shout out to all my country folk, from Carolina to Mississippi and everywhere in between! 9th Wonder!

[Big KRIT:]
It's country livin, it's much love man, shout out to 9th, what's goin' on mane? Appreciate you lettin' a country boy on the record, it's love all the same

[Rapsody:]
I'm a country girl, Carolina be where I'm from
Twang when I speak slang, whole lot of fresh air in my lungs
Ain't gon change myself, no I'll never, naw
When I was young a lil' less tall on grass and dirt I would ball
In the store, walking in my house shoes cool
Pops got a big automobile growing up he named big blue
And the car's here, we drive real young
Gotta add some sugar to my tea to sweeten my tongue
And we hang late, at the hole in the wall places
Drink moonshine, play spades, talk sports and cut them aces
Twin jokers, being loud, I'm from the country I'm proud
Our laces untied and un-tucked and hang on the ground
Mama told me show respect and bless my food 'fore it's down
Say "No, sir" or "Yes No Ma'am" when spoken to around town
And the food is mostly fried add an inch to my thighs
Bump that volume, Bun B, OutKast, UGK when I ride
It's unique down in the south where you speak from your mouth
There's random folk all in the street don't lock the doors to your house
In church three, four times in a week
And all my aunts, uncles, grandmas all live on the same street
Summer's hot here on 4 wheelers we roam
When we young, but when we grown we sit high on big chrome
Country livin and dirt road remedies
Grandma made medicine out of tea and leaves

[Big KRIT:]
Cause you know the score, I still represent for mine
Gotta give it all I got, I don't wanna waste no time
We all got family in the south, Don't believe me?
I'll welcome ya'll with open arms come see me
In Mississippi

Okay now mason jars is drippin', red buckets in our kitchen
Heard they was delicious, but I ain't fuckin' with them chitlins
But still grateful for what was given while they talk down on my state
Call us slow and uneducated but won't say it to my face
Most never been, most never will, they can't enjoy what I did
Backyards was hella large playin' ball with my friends
It takes a village to raise a child and I was surrounded by kin
A lot of elders who knew better and had knowledge to lend
Like never hold your head down, boy, be proud of your skin
Believe that God is in your heart and Jesus died for your sins
Sunday morning before I'm yawning we be up in them pews
Fall asleep on big momma while she payin' her dues
Sometime she cry, I dry her eyes, I know how hard times be
She said that love will cost you everything, but pain come free
Cause bein' country mean bein' strong you got to stand on your own
She taught me well I've been compelled to prove these city folk wrong
Cause ain't no dirt road where I'm nappin, no horseback cappin'
So be it if you think we whack but niggas down here still be snappin'
Took it from the Dirty South, to the top of the map and
So be it I put it down for my folk and holla "Hold up, what's happenin?"

Cause you know the score, I still represent for mine
Gotta give it all I got, I don't wanna waste no time
We all got family in the south, Don't believe me?
I'll welcome ya'll with open arms come see me
In Mississippi

// Black Diamond //

[Rapsody:]
Rap Diddy and Raekwon The Chef
Salute to the Wu

Black diamonds sence from Muhammad, I drop
Rhyming, reminding most of what they forgot
Raya lights, so at night yelling rap don't stop
Keep on going, we gon' continue elevating our plots
Dre 3000, haters, gon' single them
Scottie Pippen, tripping, one of the best, am I not?
If you forgot, since the top, I've been listening to them hot
Rae, Jay, Toomp from Atlanta, and Dre
Wu, saluting diamonds, New York to LA
Okay, player, now you see the root of me sway
From that, I never will, culture over bills, pills
Party life, I told y'all I'm really nice like Rae
[?] I shook 'em up, jello
Spitting diamonds and pearls, I am rap, hello
For those who couldn't catch yo, the name from intro
The info remains the same, I am hot and nitro
Glistering, glistening like black diamonds
Raya light bright, huh, this is semi blinding
Binding, my name here with some of the greats
These are treasures of our time, diamonds never outdate
Black diamonds

[9th Wonder:]
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"

[Raekwon:]
Black diamonds and pearls
What up, 9th?
Rapsody, what's good?
Raekwon, you already know
Yeah, I got you

Under the trenches, black men [?], that's red
Getting headshots, duffle bags under my legs
We breadwinners, the coalition slicker than Benzes
On my off day, paper day, play with my chemist
Bum rushing, bread, guns dumping, run from the feds
Rocking Nike boots, pencils in our hand, Nas said
We on the come up, an old school don on the run up
Take stacks of bread home and black in the summer
Real niggas know my get down, I run with my team
That pull out, let 80 out, and jump in the Beams
What it do bruh? That's my sister, give us some love
Or stay away, you might die tryna bob with these plug
I don't regret shit, veteran who vote for the real
Run around the world twice shooting dice with the buil
Them Shaolin alling, most of them wilding
(Word up) Word to mother, disrespect my medallion

[9th Wonder:]
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"
It go black diamonds and pearls
"You could be mine, we both shine"

[Murs:]
The style is intergalactic
Not for the radio but radioactive
It's for the white and the black kids
The Latin, Asian, Native kids that's playin' this rap shit

The style is intergalactic
Not for the radio but radioactive
It's for the white and the black kids
The Latin, Asian, Native kids that's playin' this rap shit

[Rapsody:]
Adverse as them artists that's over the industry
Fucked up deals celebrated with Hennessy
I'm strong with the Force I ain't feelin' your energy
Shady politics, I leave all that to them Kennedys
Blow 'em off, Kenny G, too advanced for you mentally
I've been takin' note of how you hold niggas for centuries
Jedi
Fuck the Dark Side
You fake as enemy
Swear you word is your bond, more like penitentiaries
I ain't fakin' with you fuckers
Came prepared with no rubbers
Saw what it did to Lauryn so I know you don't love her
And to the rest of you suckers, don't support us like Chuckers
Revolutionary, but you show no love to your brothers
I see ya
Disheartening, I pray for you people
Artist verses industry and niggas this is the sequel
Jedi, returning of
For everything that it was
For every artist like us
Salute and show us love

[Murs:]
The style is intergalactic

The style is intergalactic
Not for the radio but radioactive
It's for the white and the black kids
The Latin, Asian, Native kids that's playin' this rap shit

I'm interstellar
You're only intermediate
I dropped that style awhile ago, I don't know what you see in it
I'm into free and shit, being uninhibited
You are from a sector where the Jedi are prohibited
You are just a gimmick kid
I am what authentic is
The proof is in the traces of the blood left in my penmanship
You are Reptar
I am the Death Star
You can flee, I can guarantee that you will not get far
We only travel by Millennium Falcon
It's Murs and Rapsody so you knowin' the outcome
It's like Malcolm meets Angela Davis
Rewriting history to put our names in the pages
