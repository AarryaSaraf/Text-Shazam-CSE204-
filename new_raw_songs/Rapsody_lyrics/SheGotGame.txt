Album: SheGotGame

// A Song About Nothing //

Its fair to say the game is at the special place right now
I'll argue the best and the decade maybe even 20
Rap music comes and goes, rap artists here then gone
Rapsody. She's here to stay, she got game better yet she got the game
[*laughs*] Ya'll ready?

[Rapsody:]
It's Toca Tuesday the mood gray
Another average news day
Stomache rumbling I'm watchin blue ray
Cleaning out my suitcase
Thinking maybe souffle
Will suit my menu looking thru my closet ain't no Gucci
Pile of laundry just as dirty as this scene that now play
Counting on my fingers tryna make thru da pay day
Neighborhood kids running round loud as lightening
Peep thru my blinds they horse playing fake fighting, shit
Remember when I did the same
Posted up after games
All the older guys knew me just cause of my daddy's name
So I was always well behaved could never bring the family shame
Played ball yesterday and rolled my ankle, still in pain
Should probably ice it but I'm feeling lazy, I don't care
After this go off I'll watch a marathon of Cliff and Claire
I need to wash my hair but I ain't doing that neither
Finished all the laundry so I've earned myself another breather
I'll skip the souffle and probably just order some pizza
My neighbor two doors down son alway smokin' reefa
Been in my room all day blasting these weak computer speakers
Between these bare walls with all these retro Jordan sneakers
Last day of school and damn Ms Brann ain't a teacher
Hope I retire just as early I'll spend it eating Pitas
In Grant FILAs, Nautica sweats and wife beaters
And spend my summers telling my kids about Derek Jeter
I grew up off Merita used to learn Spanish in school
Grew up forgot it all but, ehhh my English is cool
So much they say my words in Spain and up in Jeruz
Spent my day doing nothing its just my current mood

I spent my day doing nothing its just mood
I spent my day doing nothing, I ain't that cool like
I spent my day doing nothing its just my groove
I spend my day doing nothing my attitude like
My attitude like
Fuck the world
Attitude like
Fuck, Fuck, Fuck the world
Attitude like
Fuck the world

Currently, I'm secluded with my all passion
I wonder if I'm slightly depressed from all de harassment
Like "when you gon get you a job?" my sister keep asking
In a weird space, but ain't overdosing no aspirins
Another movie night will get my mind tighter
Thinking Tiger
I can bounce BACK from anything I'mma fighter, I'mma fighter
Saw a spider now I'm creeped out
I sleep with my mouth tighter
Sippin apple cider, I need to add this onto my rider
Random thoughts in my lonely head
The moon red, I ain't a begger, but I beg differ like a leper
Won't add me in your circle, all good I'll make my own
Know I look crazy talking to myself all alone
Wonder if it really help to write it, if you do it stoned?
Hell naw gimme clarity, I fell upon a basketball game
Got me thinking back when I was young
I was good, niggas used to watch me like a game of Thrones
They used to all tell me "you too short to play ever"
So I gave up and in college ain't play never
Thought to myself "naw this won't be same"
So I got myself up cause I was made for game

// Coconut Oil //

Coconut oil, smooth slide through the vintage
Spot that we used to rock early in beginnings
My head used to spin then
A small crowd trippin' on me, flippin'
Now the family expand in London, in Brixton
Smoking winstons how my lips burn to touch mics
95 grey nikes
Feel the re-release of beast, middle east
Ain't not saving um like day light
Arab? Muslims? All of um my cousins
Beauty brown skin might
Bomb on a nigga
Ain't nothing to do with Qurans
Ramadan for the figures
Cheddar
Come night we all eat together
Kings and Queens accented with gold leather
Royal
Sippin Royal, smoke like two letters
Two Ls, swell
Blow up your spot, never
Underestimate the plot, my flock stick together
Shining on you daily, no matter crazy the weather
Glimmer like diamonds in chains
Pain a pleasure, in time, if it help me do better
Promised my mama, said "Imma get you whateva"
You just dream, 9th gon' keep the swing
Opposite cream, we gon ride all black living better
I brought it back, like I told ya'll, forever
Culture, keep it focused you can't sever my ties
I'm always gon ride Jamla till the death of me
I'm always gon ride Jamla till the death of me
I'm always gon ride Jamla till the death of me

[Raekwon:]
Your face feel like suede, body is a 9.9
One more time, a diamond on display
Tiffany goddess in tennis wear
Staying a dentist, all that white on
Dro mixed with Guinness
We flew to Milan
Cherry Range Ro' on the lawn
"Boo, where ya Qur'an?"
Its right here
Weird palaces in Mecca
We dressing, less filming she cryin'
All praises then extended both arms
Laid on the rug, thought about like life style
Hugged my lady harder, regarded
Regardless pardon Miss let's flow beyond
Palaces where blue water just flow
Coolin' with a bong
The ocean was talking to me
"Stay sucker free, be gone, love your enemies
Nights may seem you wrong"
Lights, camera, and wealth a song
I sat up for days before legend status
Now we be born

Its that
Its that that black sand talk right here
Word up, yo Raps what good
You know your brother got you
Damn, I hear that fly shit going on in the back
9th Wonder you remarkable nigga
You like a flooded I'll magic marker
I'm ready to write graffiti nigga
Yo, pass that
What the fuck is that name of that bottle right there?
That shit is called "mnvkhjkbwkebrds, fba"
I don't what that sht is
That shit is crude nigga
That's all

// Thank You Very Much //

Ayo, thank you very much

Jealousy ain't help you
Aided me and dealt you a bad hand going hard at yo soft esophagus

So, thank you very much

Say with success come more stress from niggas where you from

So Thank you very much

For purchasing that Source to feel more sore for not supporting when you had the choice

They used to push me carriage and still they pushing me forward
Finally can afford it, I'm working my way to fortune

Glad you gave a fuck, I saw the fuss that you put when I didn't make the cut
More niggas to cut and add um to the remix of this cut

So thank um very much to Kenny for every penny you counted that mama lent me
The stress only made me tought
I'm sorry you outta touch
Hope you understand soon enough
But thank you the same as kicking me out I won't hold a grudge

// Everlasting //

I dreamt of inching closer to the ruler
Ruler, via our rules no matter trends or what was cooler
9th told me trends come and go be bout yo music
Make it everlasting like them shoes when they be moving
Boxing, keep the people rocking, hitting in your corner, stockings over face
Set It Off
Prepared to go up in the his place and rob it
Lyrically and give it back to those you stole it from
They starving
Marvin Gaye, change he once sang about that Jamla squad is
Holla, dollas come and go
Just like the riches, wrists with the gold and silly hoes
Gimme wealth and sanity, success I got a stupid flow
Octane, stay gassed up the bar don't ever fall below
The law culture over everything if you ain't know
So, no matter what they say or pray for everyday I grow
Bringing the feeling back that all of you once used to know
Dreams come true, Jamla, the culture's beautiful nigga

I dreamt of inching closer to the ruler
Ruler, via our rules no matter trends or what was cooler
9th told me trends come and go be bout yo music
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting

Who they gon' look up to?
The idea of beautiful
Hip Hop ain't what they show in the media
Usually, they be thinking of just the ass and the funerals
What about ol girl with all the soul that Common knew?
That told of her view of window to Brooklyn zoo to Bronx
Carolina that's that kinda shit that we own
Life ain't all roses you know it sho' nuff and calm
Word to them countries waring, they still dropping bombs
My killing sprees the same, its just in lyrical form
But, Hip Hop all to blame for all that wrong with the world, right?
They just wanna chill at night, and smoke that Lah Lah
Hit shopping sprees at the mall and purchase prada
Just to fell successful, equal, we talking dollas
Pray to Jehovah, Elohim, Allah, and Dalai Lamas
In my Honda rhyming
Couldn't separate with commas
The idea of genre doing more bridging the continents
With content
Whether ignorant shit or consciousness
They all fearing our confidence
Z's up
Presidential Obama shit, that's us
Culture is what we represent

Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Told me make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Gotta make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting
Make it everlasting
He said make it everlasting

// Lonely Thoughts //

I rain, I rain, I rain, I rain

[Rapsody:]
Penny for a beggar, beg to differ
These just my lonely thoughts that sometimes get off with some liquor
So I don't drink so much no more at war with my own picture
What you thought it was? Cause I ain't perfect as the dove in scriptures
Tight as two sisters but my favorite color black
They say the color purple royal soil on my back
From the war that I been fighting just to make it off the map
I was waiting for the sun to set, they intrigued with my black
I guess the pitch is like my soul
Worn out just like my Fo's
I took the blue pill yesterday
The key to all my goals
Going over songs we like and songs we don't
Don't wanna fall short as the gnomes and I have yet to visit Rome
24 inches how we used to dream of chrome
Last year my sister moved from New Orleans and she ain't need no loans
We light up like the scones when talkin money trees
How you don't eat pork but smoke holy on tobacco? Weed
I never breath, another breed, Q, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Check the rhyme It's just my time to kill It like the purge this spring
Deep as the valleys in the Philippines and up in Cali
They say this tape is like an album
Threw one in the galaxy all for free
Magna carter I been part of
My independent ass motherfucker they couldn't water
Down look around the takeover dun took over
And we been doing shit that you average rapper can't shoulder
So, what's next I suspect your death
Welcome to the game where we trained to never follows refs
Lot of great players, but we as better as a team
You learned that watching Miami and the spurs just this spring
Scary as the ring in the well
On the scale I weigh like the Bronson or Adele
I'm shell as full jacket metal
Madame I replicated the summer of Sam, damn
Kill at ran-damn (random) I'm like Van Damm stuck in a dam
Damn, who is the killa? With agility
Flow bend like that around Anguilla
Got the skill of thriller
Came from underground to get a mill or Two
Everyday I've wrote, it seemed to wanna rain a few
I guess I'll reign for you, Philly to NY
Just to wet you up I'm tear ducts to a dry eye
My my what he told me reciting OBI, Kenobi
"You'll be the death of me solely"
I told him showly, I agree I'm Ali, cross um like Doji
Sting like wasps I serve um losses they lowley
Call me young achilles cause I snap on these like Kobe Now
Back to talking bout my day it went smoothly
I woke up hella early, last night watched a movie
And compared it to my life like 2-D boobies, the come up, like the sun up, when ya son up mornings crying for juices
Adolescents
Never stress um
Developed I bless um
Denaun thanks for the blessing
One of the best in the game
I still remain, outside still writing in the rain, I reign

[Chance the Rapper:]
Why don't you come home at night no more, no more
Why can't you see past a thing, no more

Yeah I see the gun but it's a pellet
Yeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate
They sayin Acid was an album retail it
I said I got way too much soul for me to sell it
That's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders
Said save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing
I'm a little too hard to be slept on
I'm a little too sharp to be stepped on
A little too Pac for the septum
I'm so pretty I make mirrors blush
I spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust
I'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone
On the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us
There's a metaphor if I expound
There's a better score in the next round
Me and raps go together like donuts and fresh ground
Coffee, I'm awfully softly spoken
In Autumn, fall leaf clovin
My posters on dry wall and my banners are star spangled
My demons get charred, mangled, Chancelor the Archangel
I don't pray for chart singles
I grab life by the ankle like Kurt Angle
And ask it if it's ticklish
Ask me if that's ridiculous
I'm a meticulous fickle dude
That just happens to spit a little bit
And you can tell I rapped this off my phone
Cause you can hear that ringtone in the background but I'm in the zone

// Caught Up //

I've been advised to kill they vibe I ain't seen a size
Could fill my shoes, the path I walk hella wide and skewed
I think cool is being you, if you cool it's cool
I'm just a shark in a pool outgrowing all the rules they used to use to keep us in line
Like color class in school
The fastest food is the faster to sleeps cousin
My garden like Eden, I eat in produced by dozens
Patches with Patrick spit peppers to pack palaces
Hit boards put numbers up like Malice's
Pusha, push a brother I'm wheelin it, feel Paralysis
Walk in my shoes they never like E. in Dallas did
Naked truth died, the lies is taking over, shit
I spit Hova whips
See thru the tops pass the oval shit-
Presidential I'm with dat Godliness
I'm gon' body this
You wanna test me?
Motherfucker come get bodied then
Cause It's whatever

[Raheem:]
I want this thing forever
But, everyday I (can't get caught up)
I want that life forever
But I - can't - get - caught - up

Caught in judgements, love them so I let it go
Let um know the patience of Job is what I rode,
Thru bid Adieu, morning dew I couldn't let the load slow me
Four cloves, I'm one of one, a rarity if you pairing, parenting wasn't done
Mama shoulda showed you what truth was
Spell it like new tux, black and white, plain to see I'm the future
Show it like Hooters, my boosters still believe in me
So I have no time to get caught in your insecurities
Purity I'm Mercutio in my wittiness
More fuel for the fire, I ain't forgetting shit
Getting mine with Krit Def Jam blocking
Don't matter much to me forever I stay rocking
Today we praying for Boston
Today we praying for Martin, both of them Martins march for um
Hope one day the world stop waring
Like autism, it's the system we assisting
Baby find some wisdom listen we gotta lift um
I'm too gifted to get caught up in the business
Handle my business till I am my own business
Smartness I be flexin like cartilage, can't get to deep caught in without rubbers
My brothers I love ya
But lotta of ya trouble
Why we had to part ways
Set you outside of the bubble
Can't get caught up

If my soul was to be accompanied
You werent my company
The one that could come and comfort me
Constantly I found myself caught up
Thinking of a future family, two sons a daughter
Water I shed many nights, thinking you might
Won't in the right direction of your life
I was right
Caught up in easy women
Heard you dabbled with white sauce
Wouldn't of been in XXL or the Source had I stayed
It's just the grave reality
Thanks for valory, I ain't get caught out
The causality, just a dead soul
When happiness let go
Dipped in petro
Burning we learn less tho when our eyes closed
And we can't see thru forest
Stuck on fortune, The only reason you court them
Deport them
Report them to endorphines
They ain't doing jobs
Don't get caught if he don't love as hard
The heart

// Generation //

[Mac Miller:]
These... Generations, combination of generations
Levitating through matrixes
Baby, heaven's waiting
I feel naked, consider the fact that hell is vacant
The temptation was just your imagination
Listen, we know the feeling like a nursery rhyme
Blood rushes to the head make a burgundy mind
News anchor, I channel Ron Burgundy's mind
Cut the lights, turn your church to a shrine
Now you blind, so
Fuck the cops if your daddy one, fuck ya pops
I hate the personality but girl I love the box
Something's off, they popping a penicillin
I'm illin', your paper thin as Sicilian crust
Warning civilians are aiming adhere, they killin' us
Still I must continue to venture into outer space
You got my dick inside your mouth tell me how it taste
I'm not, I'm just, I'm just saying...

[Jared Evans:]
Cause we all meant for something
Even though we feel like we're nothing
Because it's our generation, oh
Our generation, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Our gene', our gene', our generation)

[Rapsody:]
Yo, fisherman buckets, double cups
I only lean on family and double on my dutch
Generation hope faith is tomorrow's trust
Land of milk and honey
All the boys found it inside a bus
Only lust for the feeling of large city's dust
I could pierce the night with a light
Bright as a delta's tusk
We either shine through it or not
Where your block
Whether east or west
We don't go stressing unless it's cops, shit
Justice ain't for us
I've come to that conclusion
Wildin' out in my mind
They lost in they illusions
Uh, dear Momma say, my Momma sigh
We die too young, she told me have fun
YOLO lie
She told me try, I had no time
Go for broke
Life deep, but unlike a reef I could stay afloat
Never drown, say something profound by the pound
We keep a lot of soul
Like Kenneth Cole walking through the town
My generation yes, my generation no
My generation ain't stressing
Burning that chemical
Higher pinnacle when I pen a flow of this magnitude
My third eye off the hour of all this on the news
In the battle they rattled to see a Black and Jew
Stand for the lives of all that died like me and you
We don't see color or class, we more powerful
Generation change, we rearranging they attitude

[Jared Evans:]
Cause we all meant for something
Even though we feel like we're nothing
Because it's our generation, oh
Our generation, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Our gene', our gene', our generation)

// Special Way //

I love you like a fat kid love cake
Love the way you listen to me; before you eat, you say grace
Mama called me today, told me she'd die for me
Still got love for you niggas that wouldn't cry for me
My story start on the twenty-first of the winter
And it's cold, I've been baring my soul just like a pin-up
In the summer when it's hot we be rolling without the tint up
And I miss the good old days when good music came through antennas
When it's 10 up in the morning we wake up like "How we end up?"
But I'm glad we did handling biz, baby you in it
That's real love, it ain't been different since the beginning
We covered all bases and still we're going for innings
No need to make it complex baby, that's what its meant for
That's word to my center, I shelter you like we indoor
Because I care about you
And anybody that'd want to hurt it I'd paralyze you

You're like that feeling of a father's first son born
Unconditional, I fell the speed of asteroid
In love, I send kisses and hugs to old misters
With all my goodbyes, finally completed my picture
The colors so descriptive
My heart resembled Christmas night
Gotta glow the window to my soul shows Christmas lights
Woke up to greatest gift; God read my list last night
I had a dream and what I seen was simpler than black and white
They don't like to take advice
You don't love when you see it so, look I have lapped you twice
Fruits of our labor are dying we need love in life
Call up your station, we need train all our people right
Cause in the station they evaporatin' rapidly
Word to Oscar, give him Oscars for his great mastery
Depicting a story we know too well, I love you niggas
In the most special way and know that we always witchu
Love

// Dark Knights //

[Rapsody:]
Dark nights been cold like night veins
Serve niggas chills, I'm I'll like Mike Caine
Express and I stress the best, I'm insane
To these bitches like Miranda, I'm lyrically Bruce Wayne
Pain I felt it and belted it out in sorrow
Broke days, way too embarrassed to ask to borrow
A dollar for a quarter a gallon of gas tomorrow
Struggles by the car load had me lower than Carlos
Borders we sorta ignore 'em like fuck a lock yo
No plan drawn still stone cold, a Picasso
Nothing quite impossible, something similar to Pac though
Young poet, we know it, sow it so it'll grow blow
Where the wind take me, money'll never make me
No matter where I go, so money'll never break me
Though I been broke like pieces of soap pasted
To cleanse my soul bands like grams we raising
Reaching for better, it's whatever I'm Kevin Bacon
X men out that want none a part of my making why
Bane ain't a match for this emcee
And Dark Knight bat wings need a M3
All y'all drool for Ra's al Ghul protÃ©gÃ©
I've been cold as Jay on "3 Kings" nigga get schooled
I am the, 5'3" Morgan free-flow genius
Underground killer like Bane whole team is
They couldn't cop me now they stuck underneath me
I took a leap of faith and I climbed up easy
Rap-so-deezy and Eric Jones, I Gotham City
I save ya all from the bad rappers in ya city
And let you take a couple jewels like the cat lady
Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
Yea
I say Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
It's so quick to flip and crown a next king
Trip like crips do the blues make us swing
Low as the flow where chariots rider wings?
I decoded the message arrested by modern bling
[?] lives that never use knives to bring
Themselves up a notch only took a stab at a dream
Coliseums, used to pray to him, the Elohim
Witnessed the door to door and I guarded it like Hakeem
The Idi Amin of all these idiots mean I know
Toe to toe go with the best that they throw in the ring seen
Lot of despair, pair me with none of them things, two left
Feets only dance to the beats with B's we rep
Honesty, my history Cherokee and it's African
Deep blue cinnamon, every bit of the black in him
Embrace heritage, capitalize like acronyms
We higher seed, no need to deplete it like the Vatican
And Benedict ourself, deplenish all our wealth

Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself...

[Wale:]
Ain't rocked a 9th beat in a minute
I ain't even with niggas
You slight breeze, I'm wife beaters in winter
I'm a product of Reaganomics where the law is a greater problem
Where the niggas is spraying something and they got 'em
Word to Robin, that's Gotham
That was fiction but I'm talking about the district
Where business is booming for bird flippers and morticians
And I understand the plight of Bane
Except we using other drugs just to fight the pain
It's coming apart, I'm hoping to God you niggas ain't playing
Cause I'm more Patrick Bateman and y'all Bruce Wayne
And I do my thing really
Folarin spit pepper, young veteran
You niggas lack season like a torn ACL-a
Level headed, I put this with in yo lady belly
And I bet my digits 'bout as thick as Fat Belly Bella
I'm like the new fella meets (Goodfella)
Good guy turned heel do the crude business
Manute length is a list of niggas that may envy
But I eat danger for lunch, breakfast, and plate empty
And I leave the place with some choice ladies to fellate with me
And I pull hoes like cellos strings, nigga hear my symphony
Of the Opus Mr. Holland ain't got nothing on
Hollerin' at these hollow heads, we both shallow but I am raw
Fly as fuck, who the fuck is y'all to compare me to them peoples
Niggas questioning they outfit like Jim Carrey on the sequel, get me

// My Song //

[Mela Machinko:]
That's my song, that's my song, that's my song

[Rapsody:]
I ain't the next Ms HILL
I ain't the next him or her, I'm just the one y'all feel
Got a 9th Wonder deal
NC rappers mad at us
Y'all think backwards, part of a guild of rappers
Everything I write a movie
But I ain't no actor
I'm just one lonely woman, and there's just one factor
It's my path and mine to walk alone
Star Trek (track), I run that but I ain't chasing Khans (cons)
9th wonder flipped this song a few years ago
But it's okay cause I got two or three of those to go
And already I hear mumblings of Manigault
Call her earl cause I'm sicker girl, she terminal
I'mma killer on these beats to these streets
I had a chat with Dot about the lyrics being deep
He told me you unique just find ya melody and speak on it
You ain't gotta tote a gun to put some heat on um
So here I am mourning
Another life I'mma take
To be a part of your life every morning that you wake like

[Mela Machinko:]
That's my song, that's my song, that's my song

[Rapsody:]
They gon play every morn
I ain't Vince Vaughn but its break up season
She got summer you gone hate for no reason
And again I ain't Lauryn, but I fuckin will leave um
Like you just lost one muthafucka believe it
Watching battles of the Raine (rain)
Can't lie that line Persia spit bout Sandy was insane
Welcome to the game ya'll this is how it be
You gon win some and lose some success is never free
That's what I'm hearing lately
I'mma get rich off of this or go have Bieber baby
Ha!
Just lyrical fun
And then it's right back to spitting
Writing over these drums bout
How niggas dumb and they don't think I'mma make it
Cause they don't see the trend and who listing as favorites
And I ain't mad about that XXL
I'm bigger than a cover, I want billboard sales
A Thursday afternoon and it raining hard
I'm sittin in the car cause its quiet, I need space to spar
Y'all know it's me
And if you don't then pronounce my name R-A-P
My mama try and say my name and always mess it up
But it's alright I'd just rather be Marlanna to her
I'm from a small country city where they dream hard
In 91 when Eric died it left us all scared
I had a dream I met Lauryn Hill we had a heart to heart
She told me how to play the industry and keep my heart
9th Wonder already told me, tho
I know it's possible he already showed me, so

Finally, the sky stopped crying
Can't say same tho brothers still lying
Just today Observed the news and I ain't like what I saw
When youngins try and blame another one for de flaws

My sister feel some way about my income
And how long it's taking me to really get some
But don't worry it's gone come
We almost out the tunnel I can almost see the sun, but it's a
Thursday afternoon and its raining hard
I'm Sittin in the car cause its quiet I need space to spar
Y'all know it's me
And if you don't then pronounce my name R-A-P

// Complacent //

[Problem:]
Well problems the issue with beneficial judicial bars
No metaphor could ever explain this mental sores
Holes in the head, the critics players just the molly does
Nah it's that the devil, high as treble, riding in my truck
Staring at the driver side, hand rising up her thigh
Life's a bitch and a stitch that ho tell like the travel lodge
Dumb niggas try to change they life, for the better
So I'd rather the pull card again, but I'm too hot to sweat on these days

I get high, then I daze for days on in
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing that problems no longer chasing
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Got money now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease

Damn shit cold, when you come from where you judge bout how many pounds you sold
When you come from where you judge 'bout how many hoes you fuck
If I succeed or if I fail and either one I'm fucked and my mind
Cause I got daughters and shit
And the more I spend from them, the smarter they get
So they learn that something, shit
But I wonder who's teaching
All my bad shit I'm done with the preaching
Ya'll wanna hear 'bout the drugs, the money, sex and the guns
Or how I hate a hater and what I do with my tongue
Or how I'm with the faders and how my squad is the realest
You'd rather play my games, than hear 'bout my scrimmage
I dig it

[Rapsody:]
180 pennicle, turn back
Back to blackin out on niggas rollin on Rosecran
LA LA land, A Kobe fan
Get booted I unrouted de plans
Pulled the wisdom out and now they ain't feeling advanced
Gino the first rounds, gotta um all feeling some down-
Ward spirals I'm checkin for vitals
Waves reaching tidals, I'm reaching for titles
Tribals I make marks like
Cartwright and Bill (build) off
Till the wheels off the ground and I'm flyer than the air force
Gravitate to me and hold me down like the airports
See thru the outside
Got love for my allies
Sun don't set in the same position as when the sun rise
I'm two fives intended to be the best
So never stress the lame-os
Seeing thru the camouflage
Wyclef, Lauryn, and Pras
Score ain't even I had to leave um I know its odd
For it to be this hard and still make it
I'm forever chasing feel my heart
It's still racing from the steps I took to get this far
To get this car I been dreaming bout
Gotta drive myself farther now
Like Mrs. Carter made Hova, Jehovah Witness how
Door to door I knocked building a tower that they'll watch
Never complacent come place it into a higher spot
Higher seed, jack and the bean, no rapper'll top
These are the goals if you wanna have gold in yo stock

[Problem:]
I get high, then I daze for days on in
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent

[Rapsody:]
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing my dreams are now awaken
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Get love now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease

// Facts Only //

As I lay
Here today I

I find it hard and I find some inspiration
Why you hatin'? Fuck it, go in one these ones that hatin'
It's nada, but shots and that real, cheaper than Izod
My iPod, I'm rollin' and bumpin', pullin' in Popeye's
That's only chicken in me I'm fearin' none of these robots
I'm in the class with these Big Willie niggas and [?]
The only difference between me and them is what's in their wallet
And I ain't Wallace but damn I got some paragraphs
A few stories could tell you, could make you cry or laugh
You know the pitiful come-up days when we had no cash
Got me thinking back earlier, damn we came through swag
And we all feel like winners when we see [?]
Go Kendrick, done told these niggas that this ain't tennis
Ain't no love for you zero-ass players, lose or win it
That's the bottom line rules, it's on the news
And we should line up more than on Saturday for some shoes
As I wait impatiently on the daily for the new ruse
It's only new to you but my independence been cool
Write it when they ain't give us riders, the right to choose
Ain't that Wright brothers, I'm right brother, Carolina, the blues shit
Humid today, still human today, you crazy B
Heated 'cause they all got defeated with their inaccuracy
They was taking shots, just plotted inside the [?]
Good or better, I bet you your cheddar, I'll be a rap elite
Still writing [?], sharp as a blade
Sorry parlor, you can holler, whatever to the new slaves
We throw shade and we feel accomplished
Purchase ice just to stunt on each other, buy our honor
Take a second my nigga, breathe out, throw in a comma
Know it's much to take when you wake from sleeping, deep in a coma
Yeah, but I ain't with that drama
I'm only with this Drama
Only rap from Jamla, coolie go fill up the comments
That's how you feel?
Women can't rap, you bumpin' my shit
I guess it's all just a symbol like hieroglyphics
That things change, I still love you the same
And I'mma rep forever, that factor remains

// Love After All //

[Gwen Bunn:]
I found love after all
Can't believe that I found love, after all
The passion was lost, after all
The passion was lost
I found love after all

[Rapsody:]
I miss my baby its lonely
Watching my Sony
Tryna clear my mind, calling my homies
Like what you doing today?
Can we ride?
Break out my fives
Go wherever just so I can survive
Tho love died
The recipe they told me to therapy was charity
Shopping, lunch dates, work overtime, Sara Lee
Tryna find the humor in life, make it a parody
But narrowly escaping my fall
Depression call
In the car sing along to the songs to make you cry
The side where you passenger ride, nobody ride
Thinking of the promises all broken
Pinkies untied
And it ultimately lead to divide, reading the vibes
You'd think somebody close to me died
Redder my eyes
Cherry pies, that's the color of pain
Color of rain
It was clear I was close to insane and unshamed
We've all felt the same
If you ain't then you ain't loved you
Through it all still no regrets
He learned from what he lost and I found perfection

[Gwen Bunn:]
I found love after all
Can't believe that I found love, after all
The passion was lost, after all
The passion was lost
I found love after all

[Rapsody:]
I went from teary eyed to an appearance
That mirror present day new Simeon
Jabari the game
Triumph from tragedy
I Rose, gave love a new battery
Acid free
Corrosion we close in on the heart ache
Smooth as a parfait, we partake
Like Barclay
New beginnings, like Mona grinning in picture
Perfect, perfection I've missed ya
What a mixture
You and I like cherry or apple pie, sweeter
Different from how them other lovers would treat her
Thankful for the day God sent you to meet her
Perfection is what I needed, for real

[Gwen Bunn:]
I found love after all
Can't believe that I found love, after all
The passion was lost, after all
The passion was lost
I found love after all

[Rapsody:]
Damnit this love is good to me
Easy like a warm summer day up under a canopy
Swinging in a hammock
I'm thankful I got my sanity
Been scarred, he kissed everyone and he told me
"Damnit see, you'll never have to fear me leaving
Give you all my honesty. And honestly, it wouldn't
Be smart of me think I'm Condoleez. Know you my
Better half, if you're the beauty then I'm the beast"
On the long road and I told him no I ain't bout a lease
Kissed every scar that them subpars ever gave you
And he thinkin bout my future, baby behind my navel
We talking love and Hip Hop and no it ain't no cable
And I'm praying to the God above
Thanking him that he gave you, like
Preciate it, for putting me on this earth
Just to appreciate it, everything that he's worth
We ain't depreciating, he came to fix all the hurt
I found love again
Glad he came to cure every curse

[Gwen Bunn:]
I found love after all
Can't believe that I found love, after all
The passion was lost, after all
The passion was lost
I found love after all

// Kingship //

[DJ Premier:]
Check, one-two
DJ Premier, Rapsody, 9th Wonder
Here we, here we go

[Rapsody:]
Uh, in the presence of kingship
Washed all my demons in the dark where the fiends trip
Looking at ravines dream, shallow as these is
If we ain't talking about flying then we wingless
Landed there in the city where Diddy danced, I couldn't chance
Not in advance like priest nuns had fatal accidents
On a higher plane, I feel estranged from normal shit
Tap me on my shoulder, I told her, you just too normal, bitch
I recollect in every word they regretting
Trying to conjure every presence, became a king from a peasant
But Nas to Jay had to slay the same in his presence
Your gift like intelligence, use it just like a weapon, shit
Cause fuck second, nigga, I'm out for uno
A minute in, I killed it, and fuck it, I still got two mo'
I'm like that new coat, you show off
In the wrong season when the coat off
Sweating me, I'm that new Hoss
Polo button, no fronting, I ride for something
Stunting in the quarters where niggas rap before daughters, Hova
It's so over when rap Premier in the rap premiere
She got game, motherfucker, that's flava in ya ear
Biggie sized, my mac on track, you niggas slapped
Couldn't circle floor if you float inside of a culdesac
Yeah, that's the end to your winning streak
Word to Preemo, I pray Chicago, put down the heat
Uh, Chicago, almost put down the Heat
But never made it to the Finals, that's your same defeat
Uh, they call me R to the A-P
And that's Preem on the beat, shouts to MC

There it is
There it is
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven-sent
About to lay it down for these motherfuckers

Yo, from King Arthur to King Carter, the queen bought her
Royalty, loyalty, never deserted like Botswana, middle trauma
Decipher how I was penning
I'm pinning you resenting everything like the kingsmen
The beat stall like I walk, I'm so used to winning
This time, I told niggas my rhymes is like the menace
Society sobriety, fuck it, just overdosing it
Wade in the flow and they follow me coast to coast with it
They like "shit, nigga, fuck you gone do next?"
Tripping cause I triple like triplets, the growth apex
A text told me "you solely could be the one"
I replied like "you cried at night in silence"
Never speak on it
Beast on it everytime I breathe on it
They mourning, yeah, I killed it
They dormant, still I'm building
Like convertibles, never forced to add a ceiling
Keep my mind open, I stay awoke and I'm never slippin'
I'm never Pippen, bull-headed when it come to rap
Only way I know to be in circle where the kings is at
They say the queens is back, young Black Elizabeth
Preem on the beat, nigga rap, I'm still killing it

There it is
There it is
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven-sent
About to lay it down for these motherfuckers

// Feel Like (Love Love) //

[Rapsody:]
And it feel like love love... love
And it feel like love love... uh, yo

Baddest black brother that I ever seen
Saw you last night, had another dream
We were chilling in the city having hella drinks
Took a cab to your pad singing Billie Jean
It was like my favorite movie's favorite love scene
You know, Sidney and Dre Brown Sugar thing
Love and Basketball too when Maxwell sing
It was just me and you like Lisa Ling
On our OWN
Love Jones, Lisa and Akeem
We was playing all of 'em, James Earl and Miss Claudine
Every black love movie that you ever seen
Lyric and Jason, watching the moon, I dream
About you often, if you only knew the things I think
About your eyes and your smile, the way you wear your jeans
Slightly baggy got me thirsty like the rapper Jean
For your love, love, but too bad it's just another dream
That I often have but that I've yet to share with you
Working up the nerve to tell you that one day I really do
Got a love jones for your body baby
Skin tones, everything about you drive me crazy

And it feel like love love... love
And it feel like love love... uh, yo

And it feel like love love... love
And it feel like love love... uh, yo

Take it back like Boomerang for a day or two
Catching feelings and I ain't even laid with you
If I could go back I would go and save it all for you
Like the best man thought his best friend in the movie do
I'm in the mood to groove, see us dancing to Badu
ADD with AD, I can't concentrate with you
On my mind all the time, I'm almost out of it
Is this what crazy in love is like?
Then I'm the craziest
Visions of you every night, I lay to go to sleep
Another love film playing, wonder what it is this week
Purple rain, Apollonia, The Kid
Another a day I can't tell you I got some love to give
Brown Sugar thang like cabby and Latifah
Got me playing shy when I wanna take it deeper, I
Got a love jones for your body baby
Skin tones, everything about you drive me crazy

And it feel like love love... love
And it feel like love love... uh, yo

And it feel like love love... love
And it feel like love love... uh, yo

[Common:]
That's what it feel like in the still night
Yeah I shine like the sun but you the real light
Moonwalkin' in love, we stay in tune often
And even when we out of, girl I never doubt love
Can conquer all things
That's why I read the books that say don't sweat the small things
To be so in love yo is how it all seems
It's summertime, let's make some offspring
Caught in the act of, it's hard to fall back love
I wish we all could experience black love
Packed in the back of the Range
They used to call me Dr. Love and yo it was strange
Now I see that love yo is more than a game
It take pleasure and pain for us to get a rain
But when the stare feel good like rocking the mic
You can be my Queen Latifah, I can be your Scott McKnight
It's right

// Never Fail //

[DJ Drama:]
Footnote!
Kendrick ain't mention no females
Rapsody we gotta change that
Boss!

[Rapsody:]
For my people all on them hundred blocks
For all my brothers that's trying, ducking a hundred shots
Trying to stack hundreds we cometh 9th said to lead the squad
Blacked out and the army back me with Molotovs
Burn Molly
I'm in Raleigh, finger to all the laws
We don't follow rules they ain't meant to protect none of y'all
Camisole - They want us to feel underneath
Young dreamers, they kill our vibe but I won't bereave
I'd rather sweat one than cry a beach
Work harder till we all Carter's and Patricks D's
Work harder till we at Harvard, the black elite
New rules, new school, our generation deep
Our gene erasing if we ain't taking the time to lead
Death to YOLO I live Soulo without the seed
Control system it ain't controlling we, Hiiipower, Most Dope, Culture Over everything

From Anglo Saxons to niggas stacking
We bragging
We came a long way from picking cotton
I bask in the glory of all my brothers rising up
And shed a tear for all the ones that's on that molly dust
Ain't trying to preach just trying to reach baby it's all love
My father told me he got bout twenty more years with us
Got me thinking how short this life is, we all giving up
And God don't give us luck so get it or just give it up
Words of wisdom I heard in the kitchen my mama cast
And I ain't Yeezus but damnit it's dark so I'mma spazz
Old class I got it from all them legends
I'm in different lane but we parallel like 11
And three sevens it gets dark but I never lose sight of heaven
The sun don't shine, if I ain't rhyming I'm second
To none confidence of Big Pun when I'm on the record
And if you know I'm Hannibal Lecter resurrected
Holy as Hova and this my grail
I spill blood over it knowing that I'll never fail
Tripping on reacts when they catching I ain't male
Can't inhale so you'll never catch this winner holding a L
Eric, it's apparent the squadron is gon' prevail
Jamla the squad bringin' hell
For real

Ion know fail
I can't spell it
I only know to keep going ain't um and keep jealous
Stay up
Stay up
Confidence swelling
Ion know how to fail
I can't spell it nigga

// Never Know //

[Rapsody:]
Checking on my Twitter feed, I throw a couple seeds in
Hope you fucking feast food for your thoughts, boss
A dime a dozen
The naked truth like dimes on a King cover
Demarcus Cousin, I couldn't cover unkindess
Feeling a couple comments they come with, I'm your higness
Respect that where your chest at lioness? They blank it out
Then remember when you banking out
Testing me like Apollo, ain't no clowns in house
You see this tiger crouched 'bout to pounce on 'em
Plan B's for the morning after
In mourning for those that gave in too early and living dorment
I'm feeling like the doorman, they all open for me
I walk right through, the view of 100 stories
In despair I rise like Ware
No matter the breaks, stairs I'm climbing 'em Ferris
Wheels, unlike stationary, we move on
Forget what you'll never know, just know I'm the Don
Dada that got you bothered, Korea and Obama
I'm the threat to your persona of being I'll
But you wanna be still, enjoy your meals
In Osaka with my Ahk I'm just a rapper though
Sacrifices that you'll never know
Like love and friends and my kin stressing me about my ends
To no end until I cop a Benz with rims
But you'll never know

[Nipsey Hussle:]
Yeah, they'll never understand the sacrifices
Just now when we shop we don't ask the prices
We look good too 'em, but it's double-sided
No complaints just as long as the money piling
Grinding, no breaks on this interstate
Niggas ain't participate, can't get a plate
Crooked nigga all my life, finally got it straight
Took a nigga all his life, finally got a steak
Never understand the process
They speculate your lifestyle and don't account the losses
Underestimate what it took to get it popping
Like ain't almost lose my whole life on Slauson
Looking forward never was an option
Ended up running into everything besides it
When everybody blinded to real life logic
The ones we said were crazy, we the brightest stars shining

[Ab-Soul:]
Yo - Soul
Still caught up in the rhapsody
Don't confuse my freedom of speech for apathy
I prefer words like empathy or absolutely
But actually, my extensive vocabulary is blashpemy
The more you know the more you wish you didn't
The more I saw the more I wish I didn't have to see
And I ain't chopping trees, just tryng to chop it up with you
I heard that they copping my content across the continent
The mic check 1-2's turned to checks I deposited
And ain't nothing wrong with checking into colleges
All in all, know it adds up, staying positive
That's common sense, like water for chocolate
Riding high with my dawgs, man, y'all tried to top it
I kept the soul in the game, check your pulse
Hit the beat with my flow
I speak what I know, I reap what I sow
Bear the fruits to my labor
Diced pineapples on my rider, I'll see you later
I'm onto bigger things, I can't do it mini anymore
Labels say I'm more marketable than a grocery store
Got some dollars on my fix, I ain't broke anymore
And it seem like don't nobody know me no more
Somebody said "Soul, did you sell your soul?"
And I could say yes or no

[Rapsody:]
But you never know
But you never know
But you never know...

// Jedi Code //

[Phonte:]
Yeah, I was just chilling man
I was just chilling, just doing my R&B shit
And niggas wanna come and play this shit, man
Make me wanna get ignorant and shit
Fuck all my crew's paper up, fuck all my Jazzfest paper up
But fuck it, new Tigallo, new Tigallo, new Tigallo

Two tears in a bucket, I wish niggas a-pail
A celebration bitches, I wish nigga Chappelle
They never caught wind, still thought that they could sail
Against my Sea World flow, I wish you niggas well/"whale"
Wish you niggas pale a little bit less
In comparison to me, cause y'all make me sound so nice
I try to tell em, rap shit is like ball
You either built for the game, or you not, you can't coach height
Ain't my fault you niggas ain't sold records yet
Before you get reckless with Phontigga
And start slanging epithets
You better off walking through the crowd holding hands with two white bitches at Essence Fest
First in flight nigga, I'll never be second best
Here's the theme, I done been supreme
I can get it mapped out, make you niggas tap out
Like Ben Vereen on Cyclobenzaprine
F.E. is the team, bone thugging in harmony
We're the army of two-faces and Jimmy Darmodys
First class flight, black bag with the toiletries
Run up in the spot like, yeah give me all of these
Go and tell your boy to bring some hoes
And if they ain't bout it I ain't hanging around, nigga that's loitering
He rhymed like he not sane
But I got Rap and she got game, ya heard

[Rapsody:]
There is no emotion, there is peace
Jedi, til the day I die

I spit that wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shine like a mill worth of gold in my prominence
Had to break promises, today where the karmas is
Took a breath for every life left, that's that honor shit
All my new garnishes peel like the pharmacists
Had no need for no Hermes, I value cognizance
That's that kind of sense I'm trying to exchange aimlessly
Early morning talks with my boss deep at Cambridge week
Bane off the plane shit, rollin' in the same whip
Kill Bambi, almost messed me up he got his frame split
Blend like the camo in the circle with the same clique
Bunch of like-minds like mine universal fit
Threat like killa, put your skills up Rambo
Mine reaches all in the soil down at Amco
Ma'am so you mean to tell me this ain't real life shit
There is no real life, baby only lightness
Watch somebody bite this tonight
Just to let you know the come up ain't without a price
Shouts to Kenneth 101, snake eyes on the dice
Life a gamble, hope you niggas all is rolling right, shit
I spit that wonderama shit, won't remain anonymous
Beast of the Southern wild, New Orleans and Raleigh shit
Hush puppies staring down, beasting on the bridge
The strength of a Jedi's in the code that we live, nigga

[Jay Electronica:]
It's the most poetical, Nat King unforgettable
Clarence 13X Allah's rhapsody from Bellevue

It's a Roc Nation, Jay Electronic-extravaganza
The fans need a oxygen mask for every stanza
Cause it don't matter if you Black or Anglo Saxon
You see a holy El gliding across the stage with icy gloves and socks on
You'll be crying baby Jesus tears in your popcorn
Call the Ghostbusters up, tell em we got one, the keymaster returneth
Escape from the fiery furnace, niggas don't concern us
Uh-uh, what's your name, what's your sign
Soon as you try and shine, hater creep up from behind
The Vatican preaches Jesus then they creep up with the swine
And enslave the people of God and have them sweep up at the shrine
Up up and away, fetch a hater a therapist
Garnish the colosseum with rose petals and chariots
Candy man, candy man, spit another parable
Your show's uncomparable, the flow's unbearable
Up, up and away, fetch a hater a therapist
Garnish the colosseum with rose petals and chariots
Candy man, candy man, spit another parable
Your show's uncomparable, the flow's unbearable

Tired, my eyes wired, wanna spin tires
Escape somewhere like the Pirates, [?] moat homey boats
Can get you down there in an hour, silence and bright fire
Loungin' in light attire, my daddy wanna retire
He's almost sixty years, he's everything I admire
Thinkin' why take a shot, as I plot how I would knot it
I rubber band the retirement, green like Ireland
In lucky Pick 3 eyein' 'em, escape environments
And lowly tyrants, ridin' out in the silence
Hearin the sirens, still feel the chills
The pressure of being I'll as this
How the team feel about me like Collin Kaepernick
Started from the bottom and graduated to leadership
City hate but want me to pacify all the pessimists
Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy how they all are now behavin's
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, understand all that Woody's not saying
Singin' another tune
Another MF Doom
Wanted two face, be hopin' this tan in your moon

Ayo light, take all the delight
They hated before but now huh they love ya for life
The pressure, I fight to stay on the path of my life to write the right
So many wrongs we rollin' the dice
On, make better songs they'll sing at their proms

From So-so's to new flows, Tony Kukcoc I block a
Buck, told 'em all to get tough, wanna be a rapper
Biggie, 3K, 2Pac-a, get some hoes in your stockings
Hard work, but y'all wanna flirt, success block us
Gold, silver, and platinum - everybody gon' mock 'em
It's quite shockin' like thunderstorms in Nevada
The way they treat you tomorrow if ever you hit rock bottom
They all change another tune sang like Lady Gaga
The Fame Monster [?] humongous, I'm like a kaka
Seen straight through it, so never was victim to it
The pressure that come along with everything that we doin'
I'm tired, my eyes wired, wanna cry a bit
I'm strong, it's just sometimes I need to ex-a-tit (exit)
Out, fightin exorcists, demons hide

Work on the table with the gun on the dresser
I think I lost my mind like Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight
Light the Dutchie hoping that it spark right
Clap and hysteria, Captain America's
Shield couldn't block all this real shit I'm tellin' ya
Like a felony I bury ya
Niggas still hustle a plate, a roll, a carrier
My pressure bust pipes homey
Fuck it - you better think about your life homey

You want the hardest nigga better ask for me

Fairweather season friends, October's back
Like I reunite with the pen
I'm like Tip in sense
Welcome home T.I., things have changed some since
Your little brother K.R.I.T been holdin' it down during your pinch
In the South, out West, Kendrick, Pac would be proud no doubt
I been tryna bring my own reign to the house
B.I.G. you should see your boy Jay these days
Best rapper alive, bring it back, Timberland suede
Nigga nasty, still rockin' the same old fade
And Mike how you feel 'bout the NBA
Stacking teams - what, niggas can't hold their weight?
Had a dream about me, L Boogie, Jean, Lyte
Latifah and Rah Digga going for broke on the mic
And I wonder if they'll ever see us in the same light
Probably not, I wonder what Bambaataa think of hip hop
From now to when he recorded Planet Rock
I know some older one's that diggin' it, some older ones not
And I'm thinking about programs they got
And all they doing, shit Dilla would probably go ham in his spot
I do, wish I could've worked with him too
Welcome home Prodigy, I'm glad you're back in the booth
When it's coming back we need them hard Mobb Deep tunes
Heard he's coming back with them black-ass Timberland boots
I used to rock back early in my childhood roots
Just the thoughts that I had, I let my brain let loose
Like I wonder where Ninth a been if he hadn't seen Juice
Or Phonte if he hadn't a had that Source maggie in school
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

I'm just saying

I'm just saying

Just thinking of the future and history
And how that without music that my life would be misery
I'm Kathy Bates
With no you, you wouldn't know me
'Cause we bonded over things like Mos and Kweli
I'm just saying
This shit I write could touch a sister
Like drunk old niggas in clubs fucking with us
I'm Levi denim, I'm coming back, they're wearing me out
Beside Pro Era, older niggas, yo New York in a drought
I wonder how even still them niggas hate on the South
They can't do it
I want [?] to prove it
I used to wonder how I'd feel the one day meeting an influence
I did it Saturday
Black Dante and Badu
Nas, I wonder if they could all see through the coolness
Besides the fan in me wanted to do an Indian move
Smoke dance 'cause it hit me like pow-wow France
I want a tour Europe, Tokyo and Japan
And make enough money to take my parents from plans
'Cause her hands hurt and my daddy's retired
But he's still working overtime, graveyard eyes
And my youngest niece two, while the other one five
And the oldest one ten, she got dreams in her eyes
And I wonder if mine prove what she dream what she 'lize
She can be
And if Kobe he had come to NC
Would he of had even more now than them six gold rings?
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying

Just some thoughts I been thinking
Known to be random but nah I ain't drinking
I'm just saying
