// Shining Moment //

[Bluu Suede:]
We doing this song forever
Keeping this on forever
Shining star in my life
Sun up, sun down
Don't be wanting nothing
Real shit percent 100
I'm just showing my love
One love, one love
Get a little
Get a little
Get a little
Get a little

[Rapsody:]
I work like a ball champ this is my shining moment
Thought they could beat a nigga, often last shot going
This is the true blue, yeah I'm gon' really blow
Sold all my sneakers just to EP this two years ago
Def Jam deal fell, fuck it that's how it go
I paid dues to pay dues, the idea of beautiful
Box me like cubicle, niggas can't do it
I am more than two titties in viddies I ain't Frank Lucas
Rap dope dealer higher than heroine users
Deals they come and go, they all are abusers
High as we used to know, first time used it
I am rap nigga, nigga strung out just like acoustic
Flow translucent acting like they don't see me
Playing like they don't, passing over CP3
Kobe 24 shit, here's another repeat
Here's another repeat, fuck where the respect be
I am M-dot-E, the rap-rooted alien
Going back to kill again, notify the next of kin
Stuck like Gilligan, Flow over millions
Studied the best, the rap big William
Jigga, my nigga, rise like helium
Too big for mediums
Double XL's tryna squeeze me the L again
So over that, lookin' up, only see my chin
Colder than Michigan
No synonyms to compare me
I'm fairly rare in this world we in
But I'm still here

[Bluu Suede (Rapsody):] (x6)
Get a little
So get a little
(But I'm still here)
Get a little
Get a little
(But I'm still here)
Get a little
So get a little
(But I'm still here)
Get a little
Get a little
Get a little
So get a little
Get a little

Somebody
(This is my shining moment)
Somebody

(This is my shining moment)
(This is my shining moment)
(This is my shining moment)
(This is my shining moment)

// Legends Of The Fall //

Rap
Eric G
Cultural varying
One Love for black music
Jamla is the squad
Well Alright

These are the Brad Pitts
Legends of fall fall
Thinking of Michael and Whitney burns me like alcohol
Every night momma call, giving me more advice
Things in media got her fearing my music life
All of the bright lights, all of the fallen stars
Pray for the black kids all the leaders they grew up on
Moving along fast, feeling like day fast
Digesting's a hard task, all I want is our music back
Reagan Era dope rap, Mercedes to Maybach
Black rappers unless we gon' keep to drive that
Gunnin' runnin' 110 an hour 'till the wheels flat
We permanent like two tats on hoodrats nigga fuck that
Yo, first LB break up, now every day I wake up to more bullshit
I couldn't make up, tre like a Laker
Handle with my face up, the lord pray I shall not quit
So catch me, running like a stampede of horses
Rings around you niggas, polygamy no divorces
Passing you like some courses, lay you flatter than forces
Houses with old porches surrounded with country orchards
It's (Yup) the beginning of forever
Raining on parades in places they thought we'd never weather
Whether, radio ever play a nigga
I don't make music for radio but for niggas
My nigga, my people, a weapon I need though
Better get down on your knees and pray to heaven I don't see you
Nigga the line's been drawn
Niggas taking shots I guess the wicked get stoned
So some other fuckers buy cars and get blown
No respect, no respect, no respect homes
While Niggas in Paris they ballin' Watching the Throne
I was at home, yo
I was on the phone, telling momma hold on
This music shit hard if you plan to be lone
Like legends of the fall, legends have fallen
Michael, Whitney, just want you to know that you're all in
My memory

// With You //

I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I want to be with you
I just want to be with you

[Rapsody:]
You want me to go whenever?
Yo, passed my training day, lyrical [?] frost
Denzel intel, a chip off the old block
This ain't no act, so I don't know how to mask dope
Safehouse, motherfucka, that's been your last hope
Known to piss niggas off, like Nicki pissed off pope
And I ain't no asshole, though I drop hit shit
I'm nice, I might come to bash hoes, galaxy foam posit
I don't need those to step on stars my flow got it
A is for aniseal, looking like Kevin D
Rolling like Thunder, I lighten up on you when I sleep
Yo I stay going hard like young boy near the puberty
If you rap, homey, see I'm intelligence minus [?]
Best be afraid of me, stop picking Laker beef
This ain't no game, nigga it's war when I rhyme on beats
I am rap, Minn-e-a-po-lis Twin City spit
Falling like Timberwolves when Kevin Garnett split
John Garnett shit, ATO big fish
Salute Molly, the one's that support me my nigga, dig
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Media bullshit, nigga, shout to the West Coast
Midwest, Third Coast, forever we been close
Respect to my Zulus, Jay couldn't lay to
Rebirth of a nation so salute to my Zulus
Peace, understanding, stay aiming like cannons
Rap bucking like granite, gin n niggas is salmon
Fish out of water, I stay flipping niggas like random
I am Zulu, flow been cuckoo, check you too, ask young Guru
Rap, I got no more to prove
Night got my back, like mamba, I think respect due
Huh, yo

Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop
Remember Big, remember Pac
Never forget what they tried to make of our hip hop

You know I-I-I want to be with you...
Want to be with you
