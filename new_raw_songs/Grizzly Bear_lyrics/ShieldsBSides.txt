// Smothering Green //

Look now, the evening's here colliding the sky
Down here we lie and wait, we lie awake and think
All that we loved and learned just vanished in our sleep
There it goes

Down here the wind is high, it blows us back to earth
Given the fire's they light and keeps us rolling on
Meanwhile back in your mind, the battle rages on
There it goes

Never you want me, never you call me dear, just try
Clear out your mind and I'll clear out mine
Why don't you want me
Why don't you hold me down and cry
Clear out your mind and I'll clear out mine
Fall out in the smothering green where you're near to me
Far gone, getting lost on me now, you're never there anymore
So don't look now

Holding on for a state of grays
Never mind but the stain will lift
Searching on for that magic feel
To give me love I can make for real

It's getting colder
Fall's getting foggier by the hour
Clear out your mind, I cleared out mine
So why don't you wake me
Why don't you shake me down and cry
Clear out your mind and I'll clear out mine

// Listen And Wait //

A joker inside, a jumble man re-brought to life
And it's gone by the night, the morning brings it back, give back

And step towards the light
Imagine fades, a vision running wild
And hides in the lights
A battered face, smiles shouting loud
Listen and wait, for a voice that calls you on

Careful, find your balance 'fore you fall
Blinded, blind-sighted by yourself
Banished from that home you've always loved, so far

Down on the grass, dreamed nothing much
Stay where you are, we'll walk alone

Step towards towards the light
Imagine fades, a vision running wild
And hides in the lights
A battered face, smiles shouting loud
Listen and wait, for a voice that calls you on

// Everyone I Know (Marfa Demo) //

Every hour is so
I notice they are keep on talking ooohh
The rest of those moments
I don't wanna close this case

Under the geiser falls a [?]
I notice it and keep on bringing my hands
As if we are so cold
We both have a cold

Maybe it's something more than that
I don't want to talk with the folks in [?]
We are almost most low
This is like everyone I know

// Will Calls (Marfa Demo) //

Under your hard lens
making too few ends
meet a middle ground I know, it's defense

Oily hands, slippery slope
Pointed fangs without scope

Understand me
I know
No mistaken time goes
undeserved without, everything, everyone you know

Even if Will calls
Doesn't mean fall out
We once had a thing I know, vanished

All of my rights lingering
It isn't a place that I've been

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Shouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright?

Even if we send
Everything from both ends
So little left to, say, do, it depends

If we are past what we keep
All that was promised that was sheathed

No mention of our,
unchecked accord
I leave this, without regret, or hearsay

Even though I'll move on
Doesn't mean this goes strong
Can't believe it to be undone, finished

Say what you want me to believe
Please show me something I can see

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Wouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright
I'll choose to believe to believe what right
Even if in the end I'm blind
