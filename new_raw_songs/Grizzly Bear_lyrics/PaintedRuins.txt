// Wasted Acres //

Howling at the field
The clearest of days
Where does that hound run?

Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
TRX 250

Trust in your machine
The kick and the wheeze
That hauls for the winter

Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
TRX 250

Trusted friend
Tell me what you need
Why would you stay here?

Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
TRX 250

// Mourning Sound //

I made a mistake
I should have never tried
I took the cake
Thinning every slice
I moved away
Still playing off the fights
For every day
I share our love delight

I stare at the face
Looking through my eyes
I move at a pace
That I cannot survive
I'm hauling away
I do it all the time
Let love age
And watch it burn out and die

I woke to the sound of dogs
To the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We woke with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We woke with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks

I own the faith
Could never have denied
This isn't a place
Where I can even try
I'm hauling away
I do it all the time
Let love age
And watch it burn out and die

We woke with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We woke with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We woke with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks

// Four Cypresses //

Instead of moving
You stared into the wall
Tangled up in a pile
It's early
Make no sound
Living in a pile
It's chaos but it works
Planes flying overhead so early
Dreadful sound

Four cypresses seen from a neighbor's yard
No memory, a future
Drawing down

Planes flying overhead so early
Make no sound

Four cypresses torn from the roadside
Great thundering noise from the hillside
Some thousands of years built it up
Some crumbling form to be torn down

Living in a pile
Tangled in a pile
It's chaos but it works

// Three Rings //

You move on again
See that time to flee again
You always make it alright
Is that the way it is?
Let's get along again
You know your move around the bend

Why is that the way it is?
The morning only showed

I wanna show you my bad side
I wanna be the guy who's right
I want you to see things clearly
I wanna make it alright

Don't you be so reasoned
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?

Don't you be so reasoned
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?

// Losing All Sense //

When I woke up today I was so bound
To a memory cut long ago
I could hear all your words echo on down
And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Could I ask of you not to cut into me
Dividing all of my body for me
I was left here to go through all the pieces
Nothing more to spare

I keep looking for reasons to come 'round
To make sense of your internal row
But it's a maze and there's nothing to be found
It just leads me away from my end goal

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Like a rogue wave you
Wash right over me
Losing all sense of what my body could feel
I was able to drift away from here
I have lost all control

The cipher walks alone
The cipher lies so long awake
She can't help
One night to lie so long awake
Just thinking
Just thinking
It's too late

// Aquarian //

Great disaster, shocking sight
Scream and run or test your might
Every moment brings a bitter choice
The knowledge you can't win with what remains

Astral actor, find your fight
Walk beside your shadow life
Lay your body on the burning ground
That separates this mind from all that's passed

Never reach the end

// Cut-Out //

You are like an invading spore
Growing inside of me
Never ever letting go
Medicine is not what I need
Inhale your older self
Cut it up and let it go

Focused on the point that won't be found
Moving slowly with clear resolve
Written on your face, the only truth
Pure as ether, that empty room
Can't you see, do you see
What's out in front of you?
A black sheet

A perfect man is not hard to find
You'll never know the feel
To be a good guy inside
A panorama of all our faults
Looks the same to me
When you're waking up in the dark

// Glass Hillsde //

Gathered together until relief arrives
Eyes on the lost sons trained in the tricks of the world
Fathers and keepers packed in that crowded room

Upcountry drifters in permanent repose
Eyes on the lost sons trained in the tricks of the world
Strung out and restless until the feast arrives

The only ride in town
Object of all desire
Our fears that make us cruel
Object of all desire
The only rise in town
Object our all desire

This frontier life
The sound of nothing
Wasting time
There is no hiding
All is forbidden, all is forgotten

The only ride in town
Object of all desire
Our fears that make us cruel
Object of all desire
The only rise in town
Object our all desire

All desire
Gather your lot gleaned from the ground
All desire
Pitiful mass crossing the ocean
All desire
One drop to cut your time in half
All desire
One drop to cut your time in half
All desire

// Neighbors //

And here we go again
I pick up a pen
I write your name down
With a sense of dread
Could see you for an hour
Conversation stalls
And after so long
There's nothing really there

Face to face
We'll watch our bodies break
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Face to face
(But you left me broken)
We'll watch our bodies break
(But you left me helpless)
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play

Half a mile away
Could see you everyday
We never go there
And yet I don't care
With every passing day
Our history fades away
And I'm not sure why
There's nothing left to say

Face to face
We'll watch our bodies break
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Face to face
(But you left me broken)
We'll watch our bodies break
(But you left me helpless)
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play

// Systole //

Once in a while
Come around and bleed it
This has got to end next time you're needing more

You can take it up with me any time
You're needing
Try once more, it'll stop the bleeding

Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home

You can take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home

Give a little more as your eyes grow colder
Even if it's all that you wanted, let it go

Take the sheets from the bed
Throw them all to the fire
Watch the room light up
'Til the flames grow warm and tired

Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home

You can take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home

// Sky Took Hold //

Your mind is racing
The sky took hold
Of all my little daily fears
They never seem to go
A dusty vista
You hunger for the core
I never meant to take it so far
A mirror never shows

Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay blind to it
Habit comes and tears me open wide
All the time

Your heart is erasing
The time just froze
And left me with little doubt
That there's anywhere to go
I'm pushing forward
To leave this home
I never meant to stay so long
My reflection never shows

Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay blind to it
Habit comes and tears me open wide
All the time

Since I was a young boy it was always there
Inside me growing none of it seems fair
I've grown to accept it, let it take the stage
And leave me helpless, watching far away
