// Sleeping Ute //

Dreamed the long day just wandering free
Though I'm far gone you sleep nearer to me
If I could find peace
If this night leaves
But I can't help myself

So I'll walk out these wandering dreams
Up the north road dressed gold and green
If I could lie still as that great hill
But I can't help myself

Well it's calm and clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked
And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way than straight on out the door
And I can't help myself

// Speak In Rounds //

If I draw you upside down I can let go
Leaves my mind at ease gives me something to focus on
Could I be alone?
Could I be alone?

If I speak in rounds for a while letting my tongue swell
I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day

Step down just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost what's left before it's gone

But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly jest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another fist

Step down just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost what's left before it's gone

// Yet Again //

Yet again we're the only ones
No surprise this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move and mend and mold this break

Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak don't confide
We barely had a case

It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak don't confide
We barely had a case

It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

// The Hunt //

Prove it all to me
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
If you call again it's absurd

And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth it's only in my eyes
And I always want to rescind everything I bought into
There's no name

Fool me once it's fair
The floodgates need repair
I count on you and why
There's nothing there besides

And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign

Another back and forth turn around
One that makes no sense but it feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me

// A Simple Answer //

Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long this time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long
This time

Move on let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No bliss no light
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one

// What's Wrong //

Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left at all?

Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

I never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the throng
A mounting wave of sound
The clamor breaks me down
The ground beneath me gone
The sky might open up

// Gun-Shy //

The sky keeps staring at me
Frozen in my tracks
Nothing else to see
And when I move my face left
You're always standing there
A shadow I can't see
And even then I can't trace
You're walking away

I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down
Nothing I can hear
I found the worst half in me
I'm cut off at the knees
Can't even take a stand
Against your words and beliefs
We didn't want to freeze

(All of the years
Leaving me here
Gun-shy
The pain
Losing my aim
And why
Haven't we changed?
Story to blame?
Recite
All of my wrongs
You know it's wrong
You smile)

I don't want to say it all again
I never seem to see
And why?
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes
Recite
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp
You smile

The cold keeps tearing at me
Slowing down my blood
Unable to speak
I left my mind long ago
Choosing something false
Always letting go
And when I try to face you
You're walking away

// Half Gate //

Past the roaring shore
I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see

But honestly it's fine
When I mention how I love you
It's all I do
Even as I stray

We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before

We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were

At the end of the line
It's as if there's no time at all
Nothing to left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here

Which of yourselves is truly gone?
Checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were

// Sun In Your Eyes //

You've fallen once you'll fall again
And lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back

And every stone and every step
I won't recall
Emptied out of every thought
Just soft ground
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Gone at last
Stretched out
Far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back

It overflows
It overflows
It always runs
It overflows
It overflows
It always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows

Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surrounds you always glows
Look on your face
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out
Far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright so long
I'm never coming back
