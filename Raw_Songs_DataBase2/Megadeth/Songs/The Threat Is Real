Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!

See the burnished images of
A crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning, caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real!

Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real!
