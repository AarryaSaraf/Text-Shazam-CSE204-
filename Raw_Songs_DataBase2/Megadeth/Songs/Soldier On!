No reason left for living, living all alone
And dying unforgiven, with unforgiven bones
Dead years, and the dread years, they were all throughout your life
The road was soon your mistress, and the stage became your wife

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

No reason left for dying, dying to be right
Days, living unforgiven, and unforgiven nights
Lean years, and the mean years, they were all throughout your life
Two steps forward and two steps back, you're out of time

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!
