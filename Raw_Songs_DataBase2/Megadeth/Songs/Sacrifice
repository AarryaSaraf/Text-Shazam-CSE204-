Come listen to a tale of a tragic sacrifice
Of a warlock king of satanic ancestry
Being possessed by the worst-of-all human emotions
Burned at the stake for partaking in sorcery

The wickedest wizards barter the souls of the lost for the damned
Ooooh, spirits of the dead, for the wild and the free
Just beware if every thought has consequences
What they think is worse than any curse could be

The sky's, the sky's, on fire, flames rise, and shadows fall
Cremate, cremate, the king, sky-clad, and drenched in blood
Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you make

Every charm and talisman can be broken
It must be unwound, and undone, if you wanna break free

The sky's, the sky's, on fire, flames rise, and shadows fall
Cremate, cremate, the king, sky-clad, and drenched in blood
Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you take...
The oath you make

Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you make
