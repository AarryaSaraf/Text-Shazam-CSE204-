I know I should have seen the writings
That everything about you is fake
How could I be in such denial?
That all you wanna do is make me hate

You build me up so you can
Cut me down, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

You may believe this is
Gonna make me better, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

Each word you said my veins grew harder
I ignored the warnings in my face
My black heart is turning into stone
Cause all you wanna do is make me hate

You are the only thing you
Want to talk about, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

You disagree till I don't mind
And you don't matter, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working
