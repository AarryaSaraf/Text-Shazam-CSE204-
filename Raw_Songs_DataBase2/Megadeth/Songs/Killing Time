Some people look at you and feel sorry
They see your beady eyes and a soul that is black
It's clear to see, you're a pathological liar
And your alibi was a lie, it was all just an act
And that's a fact

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

If I told me once, I told me a thousand times
It's just a matter of time, you'll screw the world inside-out
You're a sick, psychopath, you squander everything, and then laugh
You've got to know what goes around comes around
And around!

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure
That I'm ready to go!

Start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
(I know that you're lying)
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
(You're killing my time)
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready (So hateful...)
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

Start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
(I know that you're lying)
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
(You're killing my time)
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready (So hateful...)
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

So hateful
So hateful
Kill my time
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
Killing time
