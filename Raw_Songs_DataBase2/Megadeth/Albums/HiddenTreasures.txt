Album: HiddenTreasures

// No More Mr. Nice Guy //

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister nice guy
No more Mister clean
No more Mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
My mom's been thrown out of the society circle
My dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
And everybody rose, the reverend Smith
He recognized me
Punched me in the nose

No more Mister nice guy
No more Mister clean
No more Mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

// Breakpoint //

Make up the rules for me to live by
Rules you break and just let it slide
You try and find you inside of me
Be as great as you want me to be
Hypocrite, the word that fits
Do as you say
Not as you do

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Self esteem you seem to lack
Point the finger
There's three pointing back
Control's the illusion with all good intent
Bad times are contagious
You laugh and infect
Criticist, the word that fits
Put me down to lift you up

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Watching pain is your only pleasure
Sick fascination for someone's disaster
Self suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull and you'll get the horn.
Misery, the word that fits
Can't seem to smile 'till someone's sad

You're pushing me to a breakpoint...
You're pushing me, push, push me
Push, push, push me to a breakpoint

In my opinions as a professional I recommend
We straight-jacket the son-of-a-b**ch
Lock him in a rubber room
Sedate him, heavily
And when he wakes up,
If he wakes up, we'll see
If he can be a nice boy

Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me
More that it's gonna hurt him

Let's do it!

You push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Don't push me, you piece of s**t!

// Go To Hell //

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before i wake
Pray the lord to take

I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug the picture fades
And as my body decays mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates the silk within my coffin lays
Go to hell

As they bury me now six feet there my body lies
Still feel like I'm giong down I hear a distant wailing cry
God something must've gone wrong
And much too late I realize
Go to hell

I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgement was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friend's the goat
With 666 between his horns
Go to hell

Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey too shall end below
Ah yes you're all sitting ducks
It's true you reap what you sow
Go to hell

Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to hell for heaven's sake

// Angry Again //

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips

But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry
Ow!

And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Sleight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture it's jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again
Again

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry
Ow!

// 99 Ways To Die //

If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
Cause I've burned out my today
If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
Gotta terminal future
And it's time to write my will

Down another glass of courage
And a shot of Thorazine

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Gotta short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave
Ain't got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man I'm gonna try again

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Perhaps a demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the socket of my eye
A playground of illusion
No one plays they only die
There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same

Taunting Rigor Mortis
I feel it draw me in

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

We're not ready
We're not ready
We're not ready
Not tonight, not tonight

// Paranoid //

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think that I'm insane because I'm frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel so love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
It's too late
Too late

// Diadems //

Sacriledge and Blasphemy
Sets the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became

As pre-historic as it seems
This is now, today
As pre-historic as it seems
This is now

Talkin' 'bout no vision
Talkin' 'bout no dream
The Harlot puddles for her Lies
From where she speaks

I look above and see

Entrails in the sky
This song ain't over 'til the

Fat lady dies

One man rules the earth
And rides the seven-headed beast
Ten diadems, to rule them all, to crown them all
The world, religion at his feet

Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So, run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked it's finished, done

You'll become one
You're mine
You're one

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away

Vengence is mine
Vengence is mine

The Netherworld and Sheol
Are never satisfied
So the eyes of Man are

Never sat-is-fied

I saw a new Earth today
I saw a former pass away

// Problems //

Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you, problem

I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem
The problem is you, you got a problem
Oh what you gonna do?
They know a doctor, gonna take you away
Thay take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem the problem is you,
Problem, well, what you gonna do?
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem, well you got a problem.
Problem [x17]
