Album: Endgame

// This Day We Fight! //

For this I was chosen because I fear nothing
With confidence I tread through the dead of the night
Off to another war torn, far away battlefield
Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde

On this day I decide to anoint my fists
Engaging them in the mode of power and war

Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die and I will, after you for what I believe

[Solo - Chris]

A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts

Invading their dreams before the day even starts

[Solo - Dave]

Whet whit your blood, I sharpen my sword

No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day

Sent on an unholy quest, to reduce all those who resist
To the size of their shriveled up souls and scatter them like grist
I vanquished the strangeholds that the netherworld sets for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies

[Solo - Chris]

Bathed in blood up to the horses' bridle
Its death to retreat, there's no chance of survival

[Solo - Dave]

Whet whit your blood, I sharpen my sword

No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day, this day we fight!

This day we fight!

Strip the fallen heroes, finish off the wounded
Collect the spoils of war and send them back dead

[Solo - Dave]
[Solo - Chris]
[Solo - Dave]

This day we fight!
This day I fight!

// 44 Minutes //

It was a cool winter's morning
Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
Heavily sedated with thousands of round
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

[Chorus:]
Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
44 minutes of target practice
All hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast!!!

[Solo - Chris]

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issue guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

[Chorus]

[Solo - Chris]
[Solo - Dave]
[Solo - Chris]

[Chorus]

// 1,320' //

Grinding my teeth, white knuckles grasp at the wheel
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feel
As quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seat
It doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speed

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spiting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame throwing fury
8,000 horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's 1,320' to go to the finish line

[Solo - Chris:]

My hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampede
I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spiting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame throwing fury
8,000 horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's 1,320' to go to the finish line

[Solo - Dave, Chris, Dave, Chris, Dave, Chris]

// Bite The Hand //

They ball-gagged Lady Justice
And blindfolded her so she can't see
The erosion of the people's trust
Of what will come to be an FDIC Assisted Suicide

The depression of a depression
Worldwide suicide for the economy
Caused by the dialectic chaos when the
Mob on Wall Street took "We the People" for a ride

When its dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds

[Solo - Chris]

They took everything and anything
As long as it once belonged to me
The rats got all the money; the roaches
Licked the cupboards clean of TV dinners and beer

This never-ending nightmare
Of the dreams I'll never, ever get to see
And just one silver-bullet to your head
It will set me free from all the life I wasted trusting you

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds

[Solo - Chris]

// Bodies //

This thing called "Life" goes by so quickly
On day you're here and then you're gone
This is the moment I've lived my whole life for
And I'll never give up; I've waited too long

I've waited, waited too long, I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

I've been kicked out and said I quit
Then I said, "I had enough" and "This is it"
All I wanted was just one more show for the road
Cause it was over last time before I could blink, I could blink

I've waited, waited too long, I've waited too long

[Chorus]

Their bodies left behind

[Solo - Dave]

// Endgame //

Attention! Attention!
All citizens are ordered to report to their District detention centers!
Do not return to your homes;
Do not contact anyone!
Do not use any cellular or GPS devices!
Surrender all weapons at once!
Attention! This way to the camps!

I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night

The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip, you're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order

This is the end of the road; this is the end of the line
This is the end of your life; this is the...

A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, the clock is
Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour

[Solo - Chris]

This is the end of the road; this is the end of the line
This is the end of your life; this is the Endgame

I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore

[Solo - Chris]

This is the end of the road; this is the end of the line
This is the end of your life; this is the end

[Solo - Chris]

The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can
Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the
Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!

[Solo - Dave]

Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat by the
Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, "This IS the Endgame!"

[Solo - Dave]

// The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss //

[The Hardest Part Of Letting Go]

Such a pretty face, radiant
I saw you, across the room
I knew I had to have you

Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything to take
Your hand and make you mine

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Sealed With A Kiss]

Fettered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I held so high

Go to sleep my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
Its sealed with a kiss

[Solo - Chris]

I return to the masquerade ball
And leave the long figure weeping
Stone by stone, immured in the wall
Forever left in safekeeping

Go to sleep my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
Its sealed with a kiss

[The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... (Continued)]

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go
Let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

// Head Crusher //

[Solo - Dave]

It's time to take your last walk in this world before your journey begins underground.
Not before we torment you from your cell straight to hell with a short detour in-between.
Begging for mercy all alone, unable to handle the pressure.
Before his mortification!
Now let the torture begin!

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher!

The horrific torture device for those who fail interrogation,
The most painful technique ever known,
People thirst for the worst, the skulls disintegration.
Beaten, broken, in bloody rags
Adding insult to injury, he recants
But it's much too late.
Now let the torture begin!

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher!

On your knees, prisoner, take your position
Place your chin forward into the restraint
Your head slowly caves in from the compression
You fade in a blackout from the infernal pain

Twisting, turning the giant screw
Your teeth are breaking loose
Crushed and splintering into your mouth

Winding down, cutting through
Like broken glass being chewed
The fragmented skull and shattering bones

There's nothing you can do.

[Solo - Chris Broderick]

// How The Story Ends //

Far off on the horizon you can barely see their torches
But rest assured they're out there and they're coming
If you listen, the sound is growing nearer of infantry
Marching out a hypnotizing rhythm

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Above the ring of clashing steel, they raise flags of war
A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear
Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death
Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

[Acoustic Solo - Dave]
[Solo - Chris]

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

// The Right To Go Insane //

I barely get to the graveyard shift on time
After pulling another grueling nine to five
I live from credit card to check
The paper money'swhirling by
And I hardly just, just barely, only just survive

I'm living on the edge, reality is teetering, my mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?
I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane
I got nothing left to lose, but my mind
I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insane

My stomach aches from insufficient funds
My cheeks are gaunt, my guts are overdrawn
My head pounds, starvation's given me the shakes
Too much squalor, too much pressure, and now I'm getting pissed

I'm living on the edge, reality is teetering, my mind is on the brink

Chorus

[Solo - Chris]
[Solo - Dave]
