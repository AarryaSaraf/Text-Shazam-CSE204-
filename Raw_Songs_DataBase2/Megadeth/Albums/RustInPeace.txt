Album: RustInPeace

// Holy Wars...The Punishment Due //

Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homelands
Holy wars

Up on my podium, as the
Know-it-all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou
Could-be-messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die, they die

They killed my wife and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes

Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said now I must scream
Of the overdose and the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know they'll take my thoughts away

// Hangar 18 //

Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much.

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended State of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much.

// Take No Prisoners //

Got one chance, infiltrate them
Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, deteriorate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them
Burn!

Going to war, give them hell
D-Day, next stop Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace, sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul

Love and war, they say all is fair
Take his life but won't take his hair
Your body has parts, your country spares
By the way son, here's your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one, nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's a funny thing, funny thing

Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage, nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke, no one even dared

Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you

Take no prisoners, take no shit!

// Five Magics //

Bestow upon me magic
Wizard, all knowing, all wise

I want to rule my kingdom
Make sweet the breeze that was defiled

Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin

Parade the gray robed monks
The vestal virgins, wheel the wyverns in

Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protege of five magics

Give me alchemy, give me sorcery
Give me wizardry, thermatology
Electricity, master all of these
Magic if you please, bring him to his knees

I master five magics, I master five magics
I master five magics, I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment, possessed with hellish torment
I master magics five, I master magics five
Hunting the abyss lord, hunting the abyss lord
Only one will stay alive, only one will stay alive
He who lives by the sword, he who lives by the sword
Will surely also die, will surely also die
He who lives in sin, he who lives in sin
Will surely live the lie

// Poison Was The Cure //

I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me

A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away

Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with tongue
Roach egg-laying in my brain

Stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
Till I finally threw the towel in

Never knowing if I'd wake up in a
Whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool I became dead
From a rock star to a desk fool
Was my destiny someone said
Life's a tide pool
Taste the waters life's abundant
Taste me

// Lucretia //

Sitting up late at night
I tiptoe through the darkness
Cold as hell, black as spades
Aware of my immediate surroundings
In my place, I escape
Up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
My friends all say
Dave you're mental anyway, hey!
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak, yeah!

Hypnosis guides my hand
I slip-side through the walkways
Sit in Granny's rocking chair
Memories are whirling by, yeah!
Reminiscing in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky
The crystal ball is energized
Surely that, like the cat
Waiting, Lucretia rocks away

// Tornado Of Souls //

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up I wanted to cry
But dammit this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games

But, now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self-abuse

But, now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say what's for me to say
Who's to say what's for me to be
Who's to say what's for me to do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now, I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel

I warn you of the fate, proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse, come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain, I spin you round again
My poison fills your head as I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips, you won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath; it's the kiss of death

// Dawn Patrol //

Thermal count is rising
In perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze
And the sanity they lose

Awakened in the morning
To more air pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work
While our nervous systems jerk

Pretending not to notice
How history had forebode us
With the green house in effect
Our environment was wrecked

Now I can only laugh
As I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles
In the dark of dawn patrol

// Rust In Peace...Polaris //

Tremble you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler, land, sea and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am nuclear murderer I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My systems locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgment on humanity

Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warnings, only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head, to spit into the wind

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace

Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Survival such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps

I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warnings, only time will tell

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace

High priests of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict
All pay the price
The third world war
Rapes peace, takes life

Back to the start, talk of the part
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days where black as night

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace

Eradication of Earth's
Population loves Polaris

Eradication of Earth's
Population loves Polaris

Eradication of Earth's
Population loves Polaris

Eradication of Earth's
Population loves Polaris

// My Creation //

I will give you life
You'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me

All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your master

My creation

I will make for you
A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name

She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce to you
The Bride, Bride of Frankenstein
