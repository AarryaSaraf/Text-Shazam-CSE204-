Oh! Plea-ease - don't let me love you
Just because I'm feelin' blue
And Plea-ease - don't let me kiss you
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.

Because you're sweet dear, I want to love you
Plea-ease - stay away from my heart
And Plea-ease - don't let me love you
'Cause I know you'll break my heart.

Oh! Plea-ease - don't call me darlin'
When I know you don't love me
And Plea-ease - don't whisper sweetheart
For I know it just can't be

When I'm lonely, I want you only
Where is the dream I once knew
Oh! Plea-ease - don't let me love you
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.
