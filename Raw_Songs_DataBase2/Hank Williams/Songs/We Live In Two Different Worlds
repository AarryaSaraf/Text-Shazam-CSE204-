We live in two different worlds, dear
That's why we're so far apart
You made your world out of vows that are broken
I built a world in my heart

Everyone here tried to warn me
You were just playing a game
I told them all we were meant for each other
I thought our worlds were the same

If you stay over in your world
Oh, how my poor heart will pine
Darling, someday when your memories wander
Won't you come over in mine

We live in two different worlds, dear
My world is honest and true
Sweetheart, remember when your world gets lonesome
I'll still be waiting for you
