When the road is rocky and you're carrying the load wait for the light to shine
If you find you're friendless on that weary lonesome road wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine wait for the light to shine
Pull yourself together and keep looking for the sign wait for the light to shine
Don't forget your brother as you travel through this land wait for the light to shine
He may be in trouble and may need a helping hand wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine wait for the light to shine
Never give up hope or cast your pearls and pour this wine wait for the light to shine



Don't let trouble fool you and your sin will all be gone wait for the light to shine
Don't forget his darkness just before the break of dawn wait for the light to shine
Wait for the light to shine wait for the light to shine
Keep these wordson your mind as you walk out narrow line wait for the light to shine
