There's no room in my heart for the blues
Love is satisfied to either win or lose
Darlin', if our pathways part, let there be no broken hearts
There's no room in my heart for the blues

There's no room in my life for a sigh
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darlin', if our romance ends, let us part the best of friends
There's no room in my heart for the blues

There's no room in my memory for tears
We'll let bygones be forgotten souvenirs
If your hungry heart forgets, let there be no sad regrets
There's no room in my heart for the blues

There's no room in my life for a sigh
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darlin' if our romance ends let us be the best of friends
There's no room in my heart for the blues
