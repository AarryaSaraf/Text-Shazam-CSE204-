 To Canaan's land I'm on my way
 Where the soul of man never dies
 Where the soul........never dies
 My darkest night will turn to day
 Where the soul of man never dies
 Where the soul.............never dies.


 Dear friend there'll be no sad farewells
 No sad..........farewells
 There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
 No tear-........... dimmed eyes
 Where all is joy, peace and love
 Where all..........is joy
 And the soul of man never dies
 And the soul.........never dies.

 A garden's blooming there for me
 Where the soul of man never dies
 Where the soul........never dies
 And I shall spend eternity
 Where the soul of man never dies
 Where the soul........never dies.





A love-light beams across the foam
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies
It shines to light the fires of home
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies.

My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies.

I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul of man never dies
Where the soul........never dies.
