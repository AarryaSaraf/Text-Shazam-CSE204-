Why should I cry, I never done you wrong
I kept my vows you left me all alone
You told me you loved me, you told me a lie
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry

You knew I worshipped you, right from the start
I gave you my love, never thought that we'd part
You didn't care enough, to even say goodbye
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry

You know I miss you, now that you're gone
Life can be sad when you're livin' all alone
But darlin' I'll forget you, your memory will die
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry
