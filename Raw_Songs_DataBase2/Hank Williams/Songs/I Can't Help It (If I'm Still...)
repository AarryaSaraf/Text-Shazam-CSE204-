Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You ...

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you ...
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You.

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You.
