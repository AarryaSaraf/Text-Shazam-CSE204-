ONE TIME YOU KNOW I LOVED YOU TRUE,
THERE WAS NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO,
BUT YOU HAVE TREATED ME SO BAD,
YOU KILLED ALL THE LOVE I EVER HAD.

YOU LEAVE ME ALONE AND RUN AROUND,
YOU WERE THE TALK OF THE TOWN,
IT MADE YOU GLAD TO SEE ME SAD,
YOU KILLED ALL THE LOVE I EVER HAD.

NO ONE KNOWS THE TORTURE I WENT THROUGH,
LOVING YOU AND KNOWING YOU WERE UNTRUE,
IT'S OVER NOW AND I'M SO GLAD,
YOU KILLED ALL THE LOVE I EVER HAD.

ALL THESE YEARS I'VE SET AND CRIED,
A THOUSAND TIMES MY POOR SOUL DIED,
YOU HAVE TREATED ME SO BAD,
YOU KILLED ALL THE LOVE I EVER HAD.
