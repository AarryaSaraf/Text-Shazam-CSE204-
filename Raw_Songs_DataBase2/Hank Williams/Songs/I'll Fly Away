Some bright morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore
I'll, I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

When the troubles of this life are gone
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away
To a land where no sorrows are known
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
