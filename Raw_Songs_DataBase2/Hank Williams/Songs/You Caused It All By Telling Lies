When you're alone and blue tonight my little darlin'
And you're pillows stained with tears from your blue eyes
I'm so sorry dear to say we're not together
But you know you caused it all by telling lies

Now I know I'll never find another sweetheart
When you left I hung my head down and I cried
But we quarled and now we're through my little darlin'
And you know you caused it all by telling lies

We were happy, oh so happy little darlin'
And our little home was like a paradise
But today you're all alone and broken hearted
And you know you cause it all by telling lies

Now I know I'll never find another sweetheart
When you left I hung my head down and I cried
But we quarled and now we're through my little darlin'
And you know you caused it all by telling lies
