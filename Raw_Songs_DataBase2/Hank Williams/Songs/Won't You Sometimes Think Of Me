Though our paths in life have parted 
You no longer care for me but when you're happy with another 
Won't you sometimes think of me

When the evenin' sun is sinking 
down behind the trees and the moon is slowly rising 
Won't you sometimes think of me

I'll always keep your picture it means so much to me
And every night I'll pray dear that 
You'll sometimes think of me

Think of days that are gone dear 
days we could recall if you would only try dear 
But still you blame me for all

When the evenin' sun is sinking 
down behind the trees and the moon is slowly rising 
Won't you sometimes think of me

All I can say's I tried dear 
But you wouldn't let it be
So if you're ever sad and lonely
Won't you sometimes think of me

When the evenin' sun is sinking 
down behind the trees and the moon is slowly rising 
Won't you sometimes think of me
