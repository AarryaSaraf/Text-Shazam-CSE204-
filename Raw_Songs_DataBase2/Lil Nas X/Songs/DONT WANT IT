If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm unwanted but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright

I smoke myself to sleep
I'm sad, I think I'm feeling lonely
Took one too many shots last night
And I spent all my money

Started thinking, am I stupid to be fawning
Over things that's been haunting me all my life?
Ain't I fucking living proof that if you want it
You can have anything right before your eyes? ('Fore your eyes)

And the award goes to... Lil Nas X

I wanted fame and I wanted riches
Wanted happiness, wanted forgiveness
Started focusing on all these wishes
Crazy how this shit come to fruition

I've done things in my past I'm sorry for
So please don't hold me
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me

If I say so, know they gon' ride (Gon' ride)
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm unwanted but I get by (Get by)
Tell the devil I can't have him inside

Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright (Be alright)
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it, oh
I know everything's gonna be alright (Be alright)
