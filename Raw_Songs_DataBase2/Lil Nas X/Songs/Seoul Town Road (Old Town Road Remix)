Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)


I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'


I got the homies in my bag (Yeah)
Have you heard of that? (Yeah)
Homies made of steel
From Korea, they the best-t-t
Riding to the farm (Huh)
Grabbing all the corn (Huh)
We gon' get yo' money 
With my homie in your backyard


Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'


Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
