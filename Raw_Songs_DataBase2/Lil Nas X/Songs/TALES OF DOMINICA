Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me feel like there's only now

I've been living at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home
I can't face her face

Finally grown
Ain't nothing like I hoped it would be
Out on my own
I'm floating in an ocean-less sea
Could I be wrong?
Was everybody right about me?
Scary things in my head
I can't dream, man I just

Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable

Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me feel like there's only now

I've been living at my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from faith
Can't go running back to home
I can't face her face
