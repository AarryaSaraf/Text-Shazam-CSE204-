Breaker, breaker
911, somebody come get this bitch
Thinking you a star on the rise, you got time to reply
Don't lie, you can hit my shit

You can lend me five lil' niggas on the side, lil' nigga
Couple thou', need to fix my whip
How you switch sides on a nigga who was down with you, nigga?
You a fraud, just a fib my nig', my nig'

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

2018, I was in my sister's house the whole summer
Songs wasn't doing numbers
Whole life was going under
Left school, then my dad and I had a face to face in Atlanta
He said, "It's one in a million chance, son," I told him, "Daddy, I am that one-uh, uh-uh"

I ain't never need 'em
I ain't never need no nigga
I ain't never need no feature
If I didn't blow up, I woulda died tryna be here
If it didn't go, suicide, wouldn't be here
Now they all come around like they been here
When you get this rich and famous everybody come up to you singing

Hallelujah
How'd you do it?
You been on my mind
You been running through it, yeah
Hallelujah
How'd you do it?
You been on my mind
You been running through it, yeah

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

Mama told me she was gon' stop fuckin' round with that nigga
Told me she was clean, but I'm knowing that her ass a deceiver
My mama told me that she love me, don't believe her
When she get drunk, she hit me up, mad with a fever like whoa

You ain't even all that pretty
You ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with' me, God won't forgive ya
Shit

You ain't even all that pretty
You ain't even all that, nigga
You ain't helpin' out with' me, God won't forgive ya

You know I never did you wrong
Even though I'm right here by the phone, dawg
You know you never used to call
Keep it that way now

I'll treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh

Treat you like you dead right now
I'm on your head right now
You want to fuck with me so bad right now
Well now you can't right now, oh
