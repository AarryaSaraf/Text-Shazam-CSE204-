(Daytrip took it to ten)

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Nieman's and Marcus I'm berry'd out
Walk in the bank and say fuck it let's clear it out

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)

Yeah, album gon' hit like it's 82
Got a new whip and it's navy blue
Top of the game, only 22
Look at me nigga, then look at you
You just a opp and a flop of a nigga
I'm sorry that I gotta say the truth
Thought I wouldn't pop but I popped on you niggas
Now I'm with the hits like I'm Babe Ruth

Bitch, I do not do labor
You know I done got too major
Bought a new house, few acres
I done went and got new neighbors
So fuck all that "Nas, be considerate"
I'm really that nigga that's killing it
Man all of y'all niggas equivalent
I'm really that nigga that's different

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Nieman's and Marcus I'm berry'd out
Walk in the bank and say fuck it let's clear it out

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)

(Real hot girl shit)
They can't stop me, say I can't do it, bitch, watch me
All you lame hoes turn hatin' to a hobby
Damn, watchin' me gotta turn you on
I should have my own category in porn
Ooh, I'm just such an obsession
Tea about me, your IG suggestions
Thick, no add-on prosthetics
Everything about me came from genetics
Yeah, I been gettin' money, I ain't new to this
Miss one, catch one, I ain't new to fish
But if he throwin' it raw
And I get hooked, then you're doin' your job
Baby, all these hoes imitate me
You could fuck a Stan or the Real Slim Shady
Niggas be toxic, suck your soul out then block him
Got more cream than a sundae topping

I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' hear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime they gon' fear me
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
I'm the same dolla sign slime (Oh)
