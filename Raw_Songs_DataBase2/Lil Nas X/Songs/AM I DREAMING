Every song
Every dream filled with help from beyond
As I'm sinking
I relive the story

Every try
Every breakthrough and every cry
As I'm sinking
I relive the story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fading
Replaying these thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done

Tears running dry
Shattered inside, but I still gotta smile
As I'm sinking, I relive the story
Glitter comes off, battered and blue, but I gotta go on
As I'm singing, I rewrite my story

Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh, never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fading
Replaying these thoughts I thought while sinking down
Oh, never forget me
And everything I've done
