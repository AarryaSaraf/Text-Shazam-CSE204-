The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out

Everything we talk about
Living in the city is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

Turn in your direction
Feeling like I need attention
Told you this once or twice
Won't you hear?
I see you in the yard, drinking a beer
Leaving me undressed like some cheap
Classic movie
Maybe I'm a little obsessed
Maybe you do use me

One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Kissing your mouth
You were inside of me
Kissing my mouth

Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye

The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When you're feeling a little strung out
Everything we talk about
New York City is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Where are you now
Where are you now?
