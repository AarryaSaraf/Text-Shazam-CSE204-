Dropped call mid-fall
Only you can know for now
Ironed demons
Only you can hold them down

Those girls might
Hear me cryin'
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try

Ironed demons
So will you come over now?
'Cause those girls keep tellin' me things
And only you can hold them down

Those girls might
Hear me cryin'
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try

Those girls might
Hear me cry
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try
