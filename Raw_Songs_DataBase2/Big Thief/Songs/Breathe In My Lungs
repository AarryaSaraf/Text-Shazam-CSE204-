Lifting the edge of her bed
Walking a girl to the altar
No love is like this
No sacrifices
My only child, my only daughter
How will I leave your body?

Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms

I have the love of her father
He has the eyes of our daughter
Her eyes are like his
Shining sapphires
I see holy light
I trusted you to fight
Holy light, I trust in you to fight
How will I leave her body?

Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
