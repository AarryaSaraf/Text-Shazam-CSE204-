Give me some time on Earth to know you
Help me unearth the map and show you
Thinking of her, thinking of him, want to?
When you touch me

Mirror in the sky, making me cry again
Roll up the sheets, suddenly frozen
Like a knife carving through my thick skin
When you touch me
When you touch me

Hearing you sigh soft and heavy
Holding mine till you feel ready
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue, steady
When you touch me
When you touch me

Flower of blood
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue

When you find the lonely tower
Climb inside the darkest room
Feel afraid, surrender your power
When you touch me
When you touch me
When you touch me

(Feel afraid, surrender your power)
