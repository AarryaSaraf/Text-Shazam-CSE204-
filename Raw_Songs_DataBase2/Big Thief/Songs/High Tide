Hi old friend
How you been?
What's that new glow in your eyes?
I can tell
You're doing well
What's that new look in your eyes
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?

Hi my dear
You're finally here
The water's rising up to my ears
Can I offer you a beer?
The kitchen's rolling in the tide
I'll dive down and get you one if you
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
