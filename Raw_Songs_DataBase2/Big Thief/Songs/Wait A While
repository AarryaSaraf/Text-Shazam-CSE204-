The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

In my dream last night I was dying
Only one part could come to life again
The portal door opened
I chose my heart, though it was broken

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

On a day as bright as velvet
High in the deep, a ghost with a matchstick
Told me a secret
I tell you now that I swore to keep it

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?
