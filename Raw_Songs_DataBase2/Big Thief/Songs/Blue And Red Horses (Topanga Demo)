Blue and red horses on the run
I think the angel is jumping the gun
Little red lantern watching the sun
Maybe the angel is jumping the gun

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed
Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon
Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed
Blue and red horses on the run
I think the angel is jumping the gun

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
