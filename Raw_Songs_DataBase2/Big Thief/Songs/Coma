To get out
To get out
He kissed her skin
To get off
To get off

You can wake up now, momma
From your protective coma
When you wake up
You wake up

You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the
Iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
