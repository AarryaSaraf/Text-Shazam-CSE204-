Cross twelve thousand lines
Looking for your face
Only to find not a trace
Even the memory of your mouth
Tries to disappear
Little lights turn into spheres
Blue mountain in the rear view

Some nights barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call

Cross twelve letters down
Found the longest word
This morning I'd heard
Somebody said they saw you 'round
1st and 23rd
Blue feathers in your hairdo

Some nights barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call
Maple, cherry leaves start to fall
Waiting for my woman to call

Sweet honey
Stirring in my tea
Stirring me
Forgiveness
All the money in the world
Won't buy it

Some nights barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call
