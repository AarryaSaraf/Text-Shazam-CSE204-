On your tongue
You yearn so young
The fragrant night
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright


It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright

What went wrong?
Your words were strong
Oh 
It's over but it's alright
It's over but I got you
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
