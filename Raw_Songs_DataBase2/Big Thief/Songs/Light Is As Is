Same old words
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
Light is light, is light, is light, is light
Light is light, is light, is light

I wait
I can see her looking at me sideways
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight (Ooh)
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight

I visit the waterfall, early spring
Ring rises high forewarning
Light is light, is light, coyotes roaming
Look who's laughing now
Look who's laughing now

Wind in my hands, wind in my wings
"May I have this dance?" she sings
True romance
Light is light, is light, is light, is light
