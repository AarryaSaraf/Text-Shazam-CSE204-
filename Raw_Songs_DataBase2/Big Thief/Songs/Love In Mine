Put your love in mine
Bid your body same
When your words won't
Tell me everything

When I ramble on
And I often do
Remind me
To travel on to you

Whatever comes
When it comes
Whatever leaves

Would we leave behind
Bare exsiccated shells
We'll be hollowed
And eaten by the hands

Whatever comes (whatever comes)
When it comes (when it comes)
Whatever leaves (whatever leaves)

(Whatever comes)
(When it comes)
(Whatever leaves)
