Been pulling through
Since the last time I touched you
Making due with an internet signal
Calling for the delivery to the front door

There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater threading future through the past

City of salt bone and bell tower
Country of ice rain and wildflower
Picking out the wreath for the funeral and

There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater threading future through the past

There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater threading future through the past

There is no reason to believe
Come together
Like a feeling, like a flash
Come together
