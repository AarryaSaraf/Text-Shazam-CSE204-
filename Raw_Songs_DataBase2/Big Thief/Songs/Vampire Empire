Watching TV tired, bleeding on the bed
The milk has just expired, all the leaves are dead
I'm not quiet, you've been quiet, just receiving what you said
Reeling feeding feeling filled by everything you fed
I see you as you see yourself through all the books you read
Overwhelmed with guilt and realising the disease

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

I see you there rejecting all your earthly power
Protecting and dissecting 'til you've emptied every hour
We jumped into the pond and then come under the shower
We lay upon my pillow and you open like a flower
I wanted to see you naked, I wanted to hear you scream
I wanted to kiss your skin and your everything
I wanted to be your woman, I wanted to be your man
I wanted to be the one that you could understand

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
I'm her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

I walked into your dagger for the last time in a row
It's like trying to start a fire with matches in the snow
Well, you can't seem to hold me here, you can't seem to let me go
So I can't find surrender, can't keep control
You turn me inside out and then you want me outside in
You spin me all around and then you ask me not to spin
You say you want to be alone and then you want children
You wanna be with me, you wanna be with him

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
