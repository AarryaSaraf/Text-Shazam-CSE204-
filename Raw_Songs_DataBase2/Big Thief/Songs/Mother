She wears flowers around her neck
She cooks that egg so perfect
To eat it warm
To eat it warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime

She looks that bird in the eye
Cuts his throat and bleeds him dry
To eat him warm
To eat him warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where the spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime

She makes milk inside her breast
She dove down to find what's left
And eat it warm
And eat it warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where the spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime
