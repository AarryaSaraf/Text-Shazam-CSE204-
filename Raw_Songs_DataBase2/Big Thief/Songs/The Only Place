What if all the worlds in space
Would melt into one single place
And intertwine the human race
With other kinds?
The atom is an empty vase
A vehicle to know embrace
The way you feel
The way you taste
It multiplies

So much to share
So much to share

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

What if all the time between
The words we say and what we mean
Would roll as softly as a stream
That we could ride?

We'd ride the bend from source to mouth
I want a friend from north to south
To build that question as a house
Where we'd reside

So much to share
So much to share

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side
