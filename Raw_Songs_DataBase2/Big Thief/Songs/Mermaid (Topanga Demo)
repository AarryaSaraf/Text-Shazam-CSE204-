Only a matter of time
Before we lose our minds
Only a matter of days left
Only 

You make them feel so small
When you're holding I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand

Only a matter of aches
Before the body breaks
Only a matter of timing
Only a matter of wasting for me


When you're holding I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand


'Cause just today I smiled
And I saw the number of letters
From the debt collectors I left


Don't they know that I, I've seen it all
Just reaching for her hand

The mermaids gather around
In the blood of New York Island
It's only matter of timing, before

Before this land and your land, before
Before this land is my land, before
Before this land is her land, you know

That she's gonna gather a song
Give me guilt with nowhere to call
Just reaching for her hand
