He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers blooming out like armadillos

He looks to the left at the yellow lines
Moving with the traffic
His veins have turned to plastic blinds

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
Where the stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peace and
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
They know, you were mostly our machines
Not electrical in dreams

He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers then blooming out like armadillos

He walks with the owls and the yellow moon
Walks like a river lapping
His blood is thick and tacky

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
The stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peace and
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
They know, you were mostly our machines
Not electrical in dreams

He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left
