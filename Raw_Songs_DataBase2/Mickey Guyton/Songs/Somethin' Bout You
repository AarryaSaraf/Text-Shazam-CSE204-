It's hard to put a finger
On exactly what you do
But you got me in my feelings
And that ain't something I'm used to
I don't mind, I kinda like it
Don't need nothing new
You can just keep doing what you do

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout you

You being you, babe
It sure gets me in the mood, babe
Why you gotta be so smooth, babe
It's so rude, babe
And I just can't get me enough

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
But I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout me
There's somethin' 'bout us, boy
There's somethin' 'bout we
There's somethin' 'bout you
Ooh, there's somethin' 'bout you

Ain't nothing I would change
Nobody could take your place

There's somethin' 'bout the way that you're looking at me
There's somethin' 'bout the way that you look in that t-shirt
Maybe it's the way I get lost in your eyes
Yeah, I can see forever when you give me that smile
There's somethin' 'bout you
There's somethin' 'bout me
There's somethin' 'bout us, boy
There's somethin' 'bout we
There's somethin' 'bout you
Oh yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you

Yeah, boy, there's somethin' 'bout you
There's just somethin' 'bout you
Yeah, boy, there's somethin' 'bout you
