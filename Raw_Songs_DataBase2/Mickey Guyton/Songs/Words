I'm not skinny enough
I'm not pretty enough
Feels like the world's on my back

They don't like the songs that I sing
And the man who gave me my ring
May even hate that I'm black

It's so much pressure feeling like I gotta smile and let it go
To keep it all to myself and never let it show

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
Oh, what can I say?
I'm only human

And there's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes I ain't bulletproof
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me

Sometimes they lift you up
Just to pull you back down
And they fill you with doubt

They can tear you apart
Fix up your broken heart
Pick you up off the ground

It's so much pressure feeling like I gotta smile and let it go
To keep it all to myself and never let it show

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
What can I say?
I'm only human

There's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes I ain't bulletproof, oh
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me

If we can love a little more
Hate a little less
Love a little more

If we could love a little more (Hate a little less)
Hate a little less
That we could love a little more, love a little more
Yeah, oh

Yeah, I am strong but I still cry
There's still darkness in my light
There's some days I just can't do it
Oh, what can I say?
I'm only human

There's still lies in, in my truth
Sometimes, I ain't bulletproof, oh
Sticks and stones will never break my bones, but
Words still hurt me
Words still hurt me
