Girl on mission
Just tryna turn some heads
She needs attention
Look at that look at me dress
Her kinda trouble should come
With a warning sign (Don't let her fool you, don't be a fool)

She act like she don't notice
That left hand band of gold
Got that money motive
Will wreck a happy home
Yeah, there's a snake takin' names
In the bar tonight (Don't let her fool you, don't be a fool)

Yeah, she'll break you're heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt

She'll let you kiss her
But it comes with a price
That sweet gets bitter
Then she's cold as ice
Her kinda trouble should
Come with a warning sign (A warning sign)

Yeah, she'll break your heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt

Yeah, she's (Fake, fake, fake) as the extensions that she's wearing
(Stay, stay, stay) far away cause she don't care and
She'll tie you down then cut you loose
Pours on the sugar then salt in your wounds

Yeah, she'll break you're heart
Like it doesn't matter
Yeah, she'll play the part
Just to climb the ladder
She's got you blind but I see it all
You think you're getting sugar
But boy, you're getting salt
