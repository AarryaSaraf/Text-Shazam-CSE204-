I am priceless, don't you know?
But you broke me even so
Oh, shiny, golden diamond rings
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things

Held me tightly as you dared
And when I cried out, you did not care
You stole my heart and bent my wings
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things

Oh, little boy with all your toys out in the yard
I gave you the moon
But you had to have the stars
Took 'em from the sky and you left them in the dark
'Til they rusted right through

Precious memories gone like that
You can't ever buy them back
No you cannot afford these dreams
Like momma always said
You can't have nice things

Ooh, ooh

You can't keep me a lock and key
Just to satisfy your needs
Oh, don't you know why the caged bird sings?
Like momma always said
You can't have nice things
Your momma always said
You can't have nice things
