Life ain't always all red roses, even gold ain't always golden
When it rains it loves to pour and I just can't take no more
But I know you can fix my broken

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
There's nothing you can't do, nothing you can't change
That's the reason I still pray

For the people who are hurting, who just can't catch a break
For the ones that keep on searching but they just can't find a way
When it rains it loves to pour, that's when my knees hit the floor
And I know I'm not alone when I say

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
There's nothing you can't do, nothing you can't change
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason I still pray
The reason, that's the reason, that's the reason

I just need some hope, I just need some peace
You're the only light when it gets too hard to see
Would you wrap me in your arms, hold me 'til my heart unbreaks
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason I still pray
That's the reason I still pray
