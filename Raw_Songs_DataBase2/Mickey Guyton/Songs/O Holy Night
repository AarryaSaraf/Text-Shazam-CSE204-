O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the Angel's voices
O night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born
O night divine
Oh, night, oh, night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His Gospel is peace
Chains shall He break, for our sisters and our brothers
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever

Noel, Noel
Oh, night, oh, night divine
Noel, Noel
Oh, night, oh, night dickdivine

(O holy night
O holy night)
(O night divine) O holy night, yeah
(O holy night
O holy night) O holy night
(O holy night) O holy night, when Christ was born
(O night divine
O holy night)...
