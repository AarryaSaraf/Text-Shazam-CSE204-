I know it's hard being strong
And not getting lost in a man's world
It's gonna try to break you down
But you gotta not give a damn girl
Yeah, it makes you jaded
Yeah, it makes you tough
When it knocks us down
We gotta pick each other up

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

You gotta lot of dirt on me
You know every sin, every secret
Tell me the cold hard truth
A little white lie when I need it
Yeah, sometimes we fight
Call each other out
It don't matter 'cause we know that's what it's all about

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

I'm your local dive bar
Karaoke in the car
You're my "where you at?" text
When I run into my ex
I'm your drink-pouring shrink
Shake it off
Ain't no thing
You're my thick
You're my thin
Through it all till the end

Sister
I got your back on the long-drunk stumble home
Sister
I'll be your hell yeah, when all you ever heard was no
I'm your speed dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat
Yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister
You're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone
