You're on your side and I'm on mine
And in between this great divide
There's fire in the streets
People on their knees
Holding bibles and breaking glass
Guns and armor, tears and gas
If smoke is all we see
How we supposed to breathe?

What if we took these stones we've been throwin'?
What if we laid 'em down?
What if we forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges

I know you're scared and so am I
But that don't mean we shouldn't try
It ain't just black or white
It's down to wrong or right

What if we took these stones we've been throwin'?
What if we laid 'em down?
What if we forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges

We're gonna need more than prayers and wishes
To build those bridges, bridges, bridges
It's gonna take way more work to fix it
Gotta build those bridges, bridges, bridges

We gotta take these stones we've been throwin'
We gotta lay them down
We gotta forget all that we know and
Make some common ground
What if I reach for you, you reach for me, close the distance?
What if that space between changed, if we started building
Bridges, bridges, bridges
Bridges, bridges, bridges
Gonna build those bridges, bridges, bridges
Bridges, bridges, bridges
