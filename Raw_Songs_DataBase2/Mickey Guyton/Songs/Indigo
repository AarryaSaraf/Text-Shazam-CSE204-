Overlooked
Underrated
Misunderstood
I'll explain it

Little tired
Not defeated
Not as seen
Just as needed

I'm so glad you came
If you haven't caught my name

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow or pot of gold

Lord knows the rain
Has been brutal
But what we learned
Can be useful

Take my hand
You can do it
It's hard to see the truth
Till the sun is shining through it

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow or pot of gold

We might not look the same
And it's caused a lot of pain
But maybe that can change

Hey, we haven't met, just call me Indigo
I'm bluer than blue for reasons you don't know
I've been here all along, you ain't it doing it alone
Everybody's gotta shine, every color's gotta show
Or there ain't no rainbow
Or pot of gold
