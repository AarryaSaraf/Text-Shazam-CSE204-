When I'm down
When I'm low
When my wings feel broke
When the stars feel too far to touch
You lift me up

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

When I'm lost in the dark
I just look for your spark
You light me up like the Fourth of July
Like a firework in the sky

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

Higher than a prayer
Higher than the clouds
So high that seeing Heaven
Means that I'm looking down

Higher than the rain
Higher than the sun
So high that when I'm falling
I'm still going up

You just take me higher in love
You just take me higher in love
Everytime I feel the power of your touch
You just take me higher in love

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher

You just take me
Higher
You just take me
Higher
