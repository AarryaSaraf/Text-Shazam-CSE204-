When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark, baby
And have a little faith in me

When the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin'
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch ya, I will catch your fall
Just have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Well, I've been loving you for such a long time now
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time is our friend
'Cause for us there is no end
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
