Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Don't get stuck in the past
Say your favourite things at mass
Tell your mother that you love her
And go out of your way for others
Sit beneath a light that suits ya
And look forward to a brighter future

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Sink as far down as you can be pulled up
Happiness really ain't all about luck
Let your demeanour be your deep down self
And don't sacrifice your life for your health
When you speak, speak sincere
And believe me friend, everyone will hear

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Bring your own two cents
Never borrow them from someone else
Buy yourself a flower every hundredth hour
Throw your hair down from your lonely tower
And if, and if
You find yourself in the family way
Give the kid more than what you got in your day

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Never let a clock tell you what you got time for
It only goes around, goes around, goes around
Take your family name for your own great sins
Cuz each day is where it all begins

And
Don't give up too quick
You only get one line - you better make it stick
If we give ourselves to every breath
Then we're all in the running for a hero's death

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

That was the year of the sneer now the real thing's here
