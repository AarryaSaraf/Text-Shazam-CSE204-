That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

Swipe your thoughts from Broadway
Turn ideals to cabaret
Water dreams of yesterday
Fall behind
All your laughter pissed away
All your sadness pissed away
Now you don't care what they say
Nor do I

That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

They're all gulls in the sky
They all mimic love's cry
And I wish I could die
Me or them

What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, ya call it, ya call it

That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

That's a televised mind
16 bars for the televised mind
Dublin line for the televised mind
We're all televised minds

What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, ya call it, ya call it
