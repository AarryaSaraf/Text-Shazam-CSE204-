Saw you walking in the daytime
On a stomach so bare
Sunny, my life's gone easy
To tell the truth, I don't dare

Met your mother in an early
Couldn't focus on a thing
Suddenly my life was clouded
The phone would all but ring

Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for

Afraid I couldn't make the cut, boy
And it makes me very sad
You'd sooner draft me as a soldier
Than you'd have me for a dad

Into a dream I was tilted
Into a dream I fell
Suddenly my life's gone easy
Where I was I can't tell

Now I don't even see them
Now I don't even see
Happy's living in a closed eye
That's where I like to be

Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell

Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
