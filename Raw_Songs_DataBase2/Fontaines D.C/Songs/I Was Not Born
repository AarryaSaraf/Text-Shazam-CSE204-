I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding

All you antiquated strangers
All throwing in the towel
To do another man's bidding

I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding

You won't catch me
No, you won't catch me
Not in your bear-trap loyalty

And you won't catch me
No, you won't catch me sleeping
No, you won't catch me slee-slee-sleeping

'Cause I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding
Ah

I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding
Ah
