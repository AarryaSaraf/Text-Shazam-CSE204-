Yeah

Well, I don't really like it when you look that way
You know, your always coming over to my place but you never stay
Your not a mean dirty woman, but you know I feel that way

So, I don't really like it when you look that way
Something's on your mind but you just won't say
Are you a mean dirty woman and you know I feel that way

Well, I don't really care about your diamond ring
See you more  smoking 
Like your on a rocket to Russia, your shit don't mean a thing

She's just coming over from the sunshine state
Just to listen to the people in the sanity parade
Oh, your a big dirty woman, you know I feel so bad

La la la
La la la

Well, I don't really like it when you look that way
You've got a backseat look, I saw you in it yesterday
Your a mean dirty woman, and I know you feel that way

So, I don't really like it when you look that way
You've got a backseat look, I saw you in it yesterday
Yeah your a mean dirty woman, you know I feel that way
