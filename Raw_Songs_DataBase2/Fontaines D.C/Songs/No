Give us all you got
You're in love and then you're not
You can lock yourself away
Just appreciate the grey

You have hurt and you have lost
You're acquainted with the cost
The one that comes with feeling deep
You're still paying in your sleep
Yeah

Now you're rolling in the dirt
Playing up to what you're worth
And we know what freedom brings
The awful songs it makes you sing

Don't you play around with blame
It does nothing for the pain
And please don't lock yourself away
Just appreciate the grey
Yeah

Even though you don't know
Even though you don't
You feel, you feel

When you go down to that place
It makes a monster of your face
It makes you twisted and unkind
And all the right words hard to find

There's no living to a life
Where all your fears are running rife
And you're mugged by your belief
That you owe it all to grief
No

Even when you don't know
Even when you don't
You feel, you feel

Even though you don't know
Even though you don't
You feel, you feel
