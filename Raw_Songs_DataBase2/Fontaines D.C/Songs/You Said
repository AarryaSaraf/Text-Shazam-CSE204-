You been on the brink so slow down
Don't get time to think now
You try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating

We both
Have a lot of things to say, don't
Don't get time enough to play, try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating faster

All bears
Meaning to the freaks, who dare live
Life not as a climbing stair, they're
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating

We both
Have a lot of things to say, don't
Don't get time enough to play, try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating faster

With you
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again

With you
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again
