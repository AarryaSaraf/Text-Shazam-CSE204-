Willow weep for me,
Willow weep for me,
Bend your branches green,
Along the stream that runs to sea.
Listen to my plea,
Listen willow and weep for me.

Gone my lover's dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears into the stream.
Sad as I can be,
Hear me willow and weep for me.

Whisper to the wind,
And say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breaking
And making a moan
Murmur to the night,
To hide her starry light,
So none will find me sighing
And crying, all alone.

Oh weeping willow tree,
Weep, in sympathy,
Bend your branches down
Along the ground and cover me,
When the shadows fall,
Bend oh willow and weep for me.
