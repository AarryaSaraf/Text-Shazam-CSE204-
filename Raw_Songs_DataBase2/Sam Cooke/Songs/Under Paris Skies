Stranger beware
There's love in the air
Under Paris skies
Try to be smart
And don't let your heart catch on fire
Love becomes king
The moment it's spring
Under Paris skies
Lonely hearts meet
Somewhere on the street of desire

Parisian love can bloom
High in a skylight room
Or in a gay cafe where hundreds of people can see

I wasn't smart
And I lost my heart
Under Paris skies
Don't ever be a heartbroken stranger like me

Oh I fell in love
yes I was a fool
for Paris can be
so beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette
who longs to love and then regret
stranger beware there's love in the air

Just look and see what happened to me
Under Paris skies
watch what you do
the same thing can happen to you
