You're nobody till somebody loves you
Oh, you're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king
You may possess the world and its gold
But that gold won't bring you happiness
When you are growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As long as the stars shine above
You got to remember that you're nobody
Nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

The world stays the same
You'll never change it
You'll never change it, no no no
As long as the stars shine above
But you got to remember you' re nobody
Till somebody loves you
So go on out and find someone to love
Take my advice and go on out and find
Someone to love
