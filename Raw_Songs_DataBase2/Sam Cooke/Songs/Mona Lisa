Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
It is only 'cause you're lonely
They have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you rael Mona Lisa
Or just as cold and lonely, lovely work of art

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just as cold and lonely, lovely work of art
