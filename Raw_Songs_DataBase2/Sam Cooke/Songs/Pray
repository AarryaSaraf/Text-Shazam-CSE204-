O pray when you're feeling low
when the ill wind blows
don't forget to pray

pray when you go to bed
for your daily bread
don't forget to pray

you can awake to beautiful morning
when you got troubles remember this warning
and pray until judgement day
God the devil to pay
if you never pray

pray, lalalalala
pray, lalalalala

you can awake to beautiful morning
when you got troubles remember this warning
and pray until judgement day
God the devil to pay
if you never pray

if you'd only pray
