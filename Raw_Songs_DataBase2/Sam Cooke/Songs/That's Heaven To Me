The things that I see
As I walk along the street
That's heaven to me

A little flower that blooms in May
A lovely sunset at the end of a day
Someone helping a stranger along the way
That's heaven to me

The feeling I have when I hear a touching prayer
Makes me know, a God is somewhere near
Even the birds flying around in the air
That's heaven to me

It doesn't have to be a miracle
For me to see
The goodness of my God
Is everywhere to me, oh woah

Even the children playing in the street
Sayin' a friendly hello to everyone they meet
Even the leaves blowing out on the trees
That's heaven to me
