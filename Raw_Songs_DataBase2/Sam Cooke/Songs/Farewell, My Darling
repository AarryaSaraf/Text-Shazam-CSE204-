If I had me some magic shoes
I'd walk away and I'd leave the blues

Farewell, my darling
My darling, farewell

A train pulled in, and she got on
It was so blue, and oh, my girl was gone

Farewell, my darling
Oh, my darling, farewell

If I had wings like, like Noah's dove
I'd fly away and I'd find my love

Farewell, my darling
Oh, my darling, farewell

Man may take
Oh, man may give
But he needs love
Oh, to really live

Farewell, farewell
Oh, my darling, farewell

Oh, farewell
Farewell
Farewell
