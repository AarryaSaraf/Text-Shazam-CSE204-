as I walk down the street
everyone that I meet
gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

the birds in every tree
they are so neighborly
they sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

but if you ask the amount
in my bank account
I'll have to admit I'm kinda slipping
but that don't bother me
'cause confidentially
I have a dream that is pippin

and when the day is through
each night I hurry to
home where my love waits, I know
I guess I'm, I gotta be a lucky so and so

but if you ask the amount
in my in my bank account
I'll have to admit that I'm slipping
but I know that don't bother me
'cause confidentially
I've got a dream that is pippin

and when the day is through
each night I hurry to
home where my love waits, I know
I guess I'm, I gotta be a lucky so and so

I guess, I know I'm a lucky lucky
lucky so and so
