Bali Ha'i may call you 
any night, any day
In your heart you'll hear it call you
Come away, come away

Bali Ha'i will whisper 
on the wind of the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me 

Your own special hopes
your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside 
and shine in the streets
If you try you'll find me 
where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
come to me, come to me

Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i

If you try you'll find me 
where the sky meets the sea
here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i, Bali Ha'i
