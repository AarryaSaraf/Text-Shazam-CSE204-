when somebody loves you 
its no good unless he loves you
all the way
happy to be near you
when you need someone to cheer you
all the way
taller than the tallest tree is
know thats how it s gotta feel
deeper than the deep blue see is
that how deep it goes if it is real, baby

when somebody needs you its no good
unless he needs you
all the way
through all the good and lean years
and all the in between years
come what may
how knows where the road will lead us
and only a fool would say
but if you let me love you
its for sure I am gonna love you
all the way
all the way

who knows where the road will lead us
only a fool would say

but if you let me love you
its for sure I am gonna love you
all the way
