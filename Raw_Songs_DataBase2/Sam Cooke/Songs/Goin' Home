goin' home
goin' home
I'm a going on
quiet like some still day
I'm just going home

It's not far
It's just close by
through an open door
work all done
care laid by
going to fear no more

mother's there
expecting me
father's waiting too
lot's of folk
gathered there
all the friends I knew
all the friends I knew

nothing loss of days
no more fret or pain
no more stumblin on the way
no more longing for the day
going to roam no more

that morning star lights the way
restless dream all done
shadows gone
break off day
my real life just began
I'm a going home
I'm a going home
I'm a going home
