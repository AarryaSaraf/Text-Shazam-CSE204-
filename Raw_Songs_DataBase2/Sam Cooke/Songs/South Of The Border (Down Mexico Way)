Ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh
ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh

south of the border
down Mexico way
that's where I fell in love 
when stars above came out to play

and now as I wonder
my thoughts ever stray
south of the border
down Mexico way

she was the picture
in old Spanish lace
just for a tender while
I kissed the smile
upon her face
for it was siesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down Mexico way

then she sighed as she whispered manana
never dreaming that we were parting
and I lied as I whisperd manana
for our tomorrow never came

south of the border
I rode back one day
there in a veil of white by candlelight
she kneeled to pray
the missionbells told me
that I musn't stay
south of the border
down mexico way

Ai-ai-ai-ai
oh-oh-oh-oh
