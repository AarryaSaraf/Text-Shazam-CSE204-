To each his own
To each his own
And my own is you

A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you

What good is a song if the words don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two?
No good alone to each his own
And for me, there's you

If a flame is to grow, there must be a glow
To open each door, there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me

Honey, two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you (To each his own)

My own is you (To each his own)
My own is you (To each his own)
Tell you, you're my own (To each his own)
Honey, my own is you (To each his own)
My, my, my own is you (To each his own)
