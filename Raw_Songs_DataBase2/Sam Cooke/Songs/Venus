O Venus, hey Venus
make my dreams come true
Venus if you will
Send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you
Venus make her fair
a lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
and take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask can't be too great a task
Venus if you do, I promise that I always be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall love

O venus, O venus
make my dreams come true
O Venus
