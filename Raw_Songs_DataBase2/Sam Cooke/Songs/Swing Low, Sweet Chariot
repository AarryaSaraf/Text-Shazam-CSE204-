Ooo, aaaa
(coming for to carry home) 
(coming for to carry home) 

Now swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
swing low, sweet chariot
right now
swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
swing low, sweet chariot

I looked over Jordan what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
I saw a band of angels coming after me
That's when I told them
Swing low, sweet chariot 
If you get there before I do
Tell all of my friends I'm coming on too
Swing Low, sweet chariot 
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm almost to the ground
