You say either, I say either
You say neither, I say neither
either, either
neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off

You like potatoes, I like potatoes
You like tomatoes, I like tomatoes
Potatoes, potatoes
tomatoes, tomatoes
Let's call the whole thing off

And if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And if we ever part
that might break my heart

You wear pajamas, I wear pajamas
I wear pajamas and give up pajamas
And for we know we need each other so
We better call the calling off off
Better call the whole thing off

And if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And if we ever part
that might break my heart

If you like oysters, I like oysters
I order oyster and cancel the oyster
And for we know we need each other so
We better call the calling off off
Better call the whole thing off
