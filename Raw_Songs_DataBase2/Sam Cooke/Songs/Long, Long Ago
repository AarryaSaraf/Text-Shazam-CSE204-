Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
and sing me the songs I delighted to hear

Now you are come all my grieve is removed
let me forget that so long you have roved
let me believe that you love as you loved

and now do you remember the path where we met
yeah you told me you never would forget

then to all others my smile you preferred
love when you spoke gave a charm to each word
still my heart treasures the praises I heard

though by your kindness my fond hopes were raised
I know you've by more eloquent lips have been praised
but by long absence your truth has been tried
still to your accents I listened with pride
blessed as I was when I set by your side
long, long ago
long ago
