I've got a right to sing the blues,
got the right to moan and sigh
I've got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

A certain girl in this old town
keeps dragging my heart around
All I see for me is misery

I've got the right to sing the blues
got the right to moan and cry
I've got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

Call it love say what you choose
I've got a right to sing the blues
I've got a right, got a right,
got a right to sing the blues
got the right to moan and sigh
got a right to sit and cry
down along the river

Soon that deep blue sea
is gonna be calling me
Call it love, say what you choose
I've got a right to sing the blues
the blues, the blues, the blues
I've got a right to sing the blues
