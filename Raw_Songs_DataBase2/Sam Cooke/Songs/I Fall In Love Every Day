Ooh, ooh

I fall in love every day
I fall in love each
And every day
Each time I see you
I fall in love with you
Every day (Ooh), mmm

I get a thrill every day (Ooh, ooh)
I always will each
And every day (Ooh, ooh)
Each time I see you
I want to be with you
Every day (Ooh)

This happens every day
(Every day, every day), oh, oh
When you walk by my way
(By my way, by my way), mhm
If I could only say
(Only say, only say)
How much I'm in love you (Oh)

I fall every day (Ooh, ooh)
I fall in love each
And every day (Ooh, ooh)
Each time I see you
I fall in love with you
Every day (Ooh)

Ooh, ooh
