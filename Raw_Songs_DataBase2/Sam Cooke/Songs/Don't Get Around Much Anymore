Missed the saturday dance
I heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
I don't get around much anymore

Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up old memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
I don't get around much anymore

O, I miss that saturday dance
But I heared they flooded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

So I thought I'd visit the club
But I only got as far as the door
Someone will have asked me about you
I don't get around much anymore

Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up old memories

Been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
I don't get around much anymore
