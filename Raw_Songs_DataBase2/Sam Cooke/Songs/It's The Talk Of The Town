I can't show my face,
can't go any place
People stop and stare
it's hard to bare
Everybody knows you left me
you left me
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet
my heart skips a beat
We don't stop to speak
tough it's been a week
It's the talk of the town

We send our invitations
to friends and relations
Announcing our wedding day
Friends and relations
send congratulations
How can I face them
What can I say
Let's make up sweetheart
we can't stay apart
Don't let foolish pride
keep you from my side
How can a love like ours be ending
It's the talk of the town
