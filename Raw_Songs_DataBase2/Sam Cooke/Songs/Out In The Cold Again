The song that you sang so sweetly
you called it our love refrain
now it's gone and I am left completely
I'm out in the cold again

I dreamed that our love would linger
but just, just memories remain
I gaze at a ringless finger
looks like I'm out in the cold again

so true, it hurts my pride
to step aside for somebody new
o but, deep down inside
my whole world depended on you

I wanted your arms around me
to shelter, to shelter me from the rain
oh but now I back where I started
oh, I'm out in the cold again
oh, I'm out in the cold again
one more time
I'm out in the cold again
