Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you
O, don't cry on my shoulder
About someone you knew
I told you I am in love with you

You try to tell me that
You love me yet
How come while were dancing
Our eyes never met

Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you

And oh pretty baby
Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this twist with you

And oh, pretty baby
O, don't cry on my shoulder
About someone you knew
I told you I am in love
At least I mean to tell you I am on love with you

Ah, you try to tell me that
You love me yet
How come while were dancing
Our eyes never met

Don't cry on my shoulder
For somebody else
While I'm dancing this dance with you

Do that thing one more time
