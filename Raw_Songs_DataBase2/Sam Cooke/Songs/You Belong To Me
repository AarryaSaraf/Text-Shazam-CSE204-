All of my love belongs to you
All of my love belongs to you
All of my love belongs to you
Because you, you belong to me

Even my hands belong to you
I use my hands oh to work for you
Even my hands belong to you
Because you, you belong to me

You gave me love and swore by stars above
You'd be with me all the way
You've been so good to me
That I can plainly see the reason why I say

Oh, even my voice belongs to you
I use my voice oh to sing, to sing, to sing to you
Even my voice belongs, belongs to you
Because you, you belong to me

Oh, you gave me love and swore by stars above
You'd be with me all the way
You've been so good to me
That I can plainly see the reason why I say

Even my voice belongs to you
I use my voice oh to sing, to sing, to sing to you
Even my, my, my, my, my, my, my voice belongs to you
Because you, you belong, you belong to me
Because you, you belong to me
