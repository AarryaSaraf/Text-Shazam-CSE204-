Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby, somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Yeah, when I begin to roam 
A long long way from home
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will
When your friends all put you down 
And there ain't nobody else around
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Oh baby, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby, I always kept you in my care
Ready to give and always to share
That's why you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will

Someday you may forget me
And regret the day that you ever met me
But still you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Oh I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
