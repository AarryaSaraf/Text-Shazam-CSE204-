The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
They can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way your haunt my dreams
They can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we dance 'til three
The way you changed my life
No, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
