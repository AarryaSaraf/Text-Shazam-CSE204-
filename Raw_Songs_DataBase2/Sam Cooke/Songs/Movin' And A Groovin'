I've got a girl and man she's oh so fine
someday I'd like to make her mine oh mine
she's fine, but she won't give me a chance
when I want to sweettalk
all she wants to do is dance

let me tell you
she likes the movin and a groovin
man, she likes the movin and a groovin
rock in the night out and the day in
she likes the swishing and the swaying
oh, she like the moving and a grovin
watch her move move move move

ask her to a movie just the other day
try to make her relax in a different way
it didn't pay, I didn't even stand a chance
she said you go to movie
I think that I'd rather dance

she made it plain to me
she likes the movin' and a groovin'
she likes the movin and a groovin
rock in the night out and the day in
she likes the swishing and the swaying
man, she like the moving and a grovin
watch her move move move move

I've got the situation well in hand
I found out that if I'm going to be man
I've gotta be a man
if I'm gonna stand a chance
If I'm gonna make her my woman
I ve just got to learn and dance

Now you wanna see me
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
we're rocking the night out and the day in
we're doing the swishing and the swaying
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
watch me move I'm movin movin
