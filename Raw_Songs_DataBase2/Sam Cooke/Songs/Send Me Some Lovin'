Send me some lovin'
Oh send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're far away?

Send me your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are here

Can you send me your kisses? 
I still feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waitin' for you
