The night is like a lovely tune
beware my foolish heart
How wise the ever constant moon
take care my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
that's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
when you're lost in the magic of a kiss
her lips are much too close to mine
beware my foolish heart
But should her eager lips meet mine
then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Nor a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
my foolish heart
