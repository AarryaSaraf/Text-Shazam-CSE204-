Get out of that bed, go wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed, go wash your face and hands
Get into that kitchen make some noise with the pots and pans
And all you're wearing them dresses the sun come shining through
Yeah all you're wearing them dresses the sun come shining through
I can't believe my eyes all of that belong to you

Now I believe to my soul you're the Devil in nylon hose
Listen, I believe to my soul you're the Devil in nylon hose
Oh, you won't do right to save your, not your soul

And all you want to do is, shake rattle and roll
Every morning, shake rattle and roll
With the feeling, shake rattle and roll
Sing the line kids, shake rattle and roll
Every morning, shake rattle and roll

I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store, you don't hear me
