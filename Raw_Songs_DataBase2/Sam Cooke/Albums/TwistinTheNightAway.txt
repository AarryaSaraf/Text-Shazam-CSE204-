Album: TwistinTheNightAway

// Twistin' In The Kitchen With Dinah //

it seemed to me that I heard music
coming through the kitchen door
So I peeped in, saw my Dinah with a fellow
that I've never seen before

and he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

Should have been my with My Dinah
Should have been me, I know
Should have been me, twistin in the kitchen
to the music of an old banjo

I saw him twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby, somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Yeah, when I begin to roam 
A long long way from home
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will
When your friends all put you down 
And there ain't nobody else around
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me

Baby, I always kept you in my care
Ready to give and always to share
That's why you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will

Someday you may forget me
And regret the day that you ever met me
But still you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me

Oh I know you're gonna miss me

// A Whole Lotta Woman //

I've got a rocking chair that rocks
A rubber ball that rolls
I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman yeah
To satisfy my soul

You know a boy needs a girl
She needs a ring that's made of gold
But I need a whole lot of woman, yeah
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soul

I don't need no woman
I don't need her cause she's fine
I need a girl
A sweet little thing
To love me all of the time
You know fire makes me a hot
And ice keep 'em cold
But I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soul

// Movin' And A Groovin' //

I've got a girl and man she's oh so fine
someday I'd like to make her mine oh mine
she's fine, but she won't give me a chance
when I want to sweettalk
all she wants to do is dance

let me tell you
she likes the movin and a groovin
man, she likes the movin and a groovin
rock in the night out and the day in
she likes the swishing and the swaying
oh, she like the moving and a grovin
watch her move move move move

ask her to a movie just the other day
try to make her relax in a different way
it didn't pay, I didn't even stand a chance
she said you go to movie
I think that I'd rather dance

she made it plain to me
she likes the movin' and a groovin'
she likes the movin and a groovin
rock in the night out and the day in
she likes the swishing and the swaying
man, she like the moving and a grovin
watch her move move move move

I've got the situation well in hand
I found out that if I'm going to be man
I've gotta be a man
if I'm gonna stand a chance
If I'm gonna make her my woman
I ve just got to learn and dance

Now you wanna see me
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'

// Camptown Twist //

I've come down here to see the horses run 
and if I don't make money I'll have some fun

because we're gonna twist all night
we're gonna twist all day
if I don't make some money I'll have some fun
twistin' the night away

now the longtailed filly and the big black horse
they tried too take a shortcut and couldn't get across
the black horse stick in a big muddy hole
and the filly wound up around a ten foot pole

I don't care

I'm gonna keep my money in an old shoebag

since I done won this money I'm gonna have some fun
twistin' the night away

// Somebody Have Mercy //

Somebody have mercy and tell me what is wrong with me
Somebody have mercy and tell me what is wrong with me
Sometimes I don't know how I stand the things this woman do to me

Let me tell you
When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think about how she do me
The tears fall down like rain, like rain
When I think i've got her chained down
She starts actin' up again

Oh let me tell you
I'm goin' down to the bus station 
With a suitcase in my hand, yes I am
I'm goin' down to the bus station 
With a suitcase in my hand, yes I am

And ride just as close I can
Do that thing for me now

Somebody have mercy I wonder what is wrong with me, lord have mercy
Somebody have mercy I wonder what is wrong with me, yeah

Standing there. oh honey that's not fair

And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared the lipstick on your face
Oh they smeared it everyplace. Yeah.
That's it! I quit! I'm moving on. Aw

You know your kisses thrill me so
But if you've got someone else 
I've gotta go aw and that you know
