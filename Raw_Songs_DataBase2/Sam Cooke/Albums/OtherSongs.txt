// (Somebody) Ease My Troublin' Mind //

I wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
I wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
Oh yes, I do
Why won't somebody come and ease my troublin' mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind

I wish my baby would come and tell me everything's allright
I sure wish my baby would come and tell me everything is still allright
Oh yes, I do
They tell me when you tell somebody your troubles
Trouble fly away from you
I'm looking, looking, looking for somebody
I can tell my troubles to

Why won't somebody come and ease my troublin' mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
Oh yeah

// All Of My Life //

All of my life, yes all of my life
I've waited, waited, waited for you
I dreamed and dreamed and thought and schemed
For someone, someone, someone like you
Now that you're here, please my dear
Don't ever, ever, ever go

All of my life, yes all of my life
I've dreamed and longed for you so
Once a voice whispered inside me:
Wait for someone who's true
Don't love another for love is forever
And no one else will do

Now that you're here, I'm happy my dear
I've waited, waited, waited, waited for you
All of my life, yes all of my life
I've dreamed and dreamed of you
I've waited for you all of my life

// Basin Street Blues //

Basin Street, Basin Street
That's the place where my friends all meet
Down in New Orleans
In that land of dreams
And you don't know how nice it seems

It's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
And that's the place I'm so longing to be
Where I can lose these old Basin Street Blues
No-o-o

Basin Street, my Basin Street
Where the young and the old folk meet
Down in New Orleans
In that land of dreams
You don't know how nice it really seems

But it's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
And that's the place I'm so longing to be
Where maybe I can lose
These old Basin Street Blues
Oh man I'm talking about

Basin Street, Basin Street
Where the folk who know what's happening meet
Down in New Orleans
In the land of dreams
And you don't know how nice it seems
Just how much it really means

Dear to me, yes-sir-ee
It's dear to me, yes-sir-ee
Can't you see why I wanna lose
These old Basin Street Blues
I wanna go where I can lose
These old Basin Street Blues

To that gospel feast
That promised land where all is peace

Deep River, Lord
I want to cross over into campground
I want to cross over into campground
Into campground

// Falling In Love //

I'm falling in love
With someone
Who's not falling in love with me
How can I escape this future
That holds nothin' but misery?

I'm giving my all
To someone
Who's not giving her all to me
If she only knew what she's doin' to me
She would set my poor heart free

I know there's been many before me
Who've had a one-sided love
But goodness knows
A poor boy like me
Needs some help from above

So Lord I'm falling in love
With someone
Who's not falling in love with me
If she only cared just the very least bit
I'd be happy as a boy could be
Lord, I'd be happy as a boy could be

// Farewell, My Darling //

If I had me some magic shoes
I'd walk away and I'd leave the blues

Farewell, my darling
My darling, farewell

A train pulled in, and she got on
It was so blue, and oh, my girl was gone

Farewell, my darling
Oh, my darling, farewell

If I had wings like, like Noah's dove
I'd fly away and I'd find my love

Farewell, my darling
Oh, my darling, farewell

Man may take
Oh, man may give
But he needs love
Oh, to really live

Farewell, farewell
Oh, my darling, farewell

Oh, farewell
Farewell
Farewell

// Home (When Shadows Fall) //

O, when shadows fall
and trees whisper day is ending
My thoughts are even when they home
O when crickets call
my heart is forever yearning
Someday to be returning home

When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peepin, one by one
Night covers all and no fortune may for sale
My dreams will ever take for home
Night covers all and no fortune may for sale
My dreams will ever take for home

// I'm In The Mood For Love //

I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder that
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We put our hearts together
Now we are one don't be afraid

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it and get with it
I'm in the mood for love

// If You Were The Only Girl //

I would say such wonderful things to you
And there would be such wonderful things to do

If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy, I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way

A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar, nothing to mar our joy

And I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do

If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Hmm, hmm mm
Hmm hmm mmm mm
Hmm hmm mmm mm

// It's Got The Whole World Shakin' //

It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on
It's got the whole world shaking
Something must be going on
That's what I say
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't meet that beat alone

It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking 'bout that beat, alright
It's got the whole world shaking
And I'm talking 'bout that beat, that's what I say
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't help but pat your feet

Makes you wiggle
Makes you move
Puts your body
In the groove
You want to holler
You want to shout
Makes you wanna
Work it all out

It's got the whole shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong
It's got the whole shaking
From New York to old Hong Kong
It's got that soul in it baby
You can't meet that beat alone

// Keep Movin' On //

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, yeah
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

When I go to sleep at night
I add up my day
Tryin' to recall the things I've done
And debts I have to pay
For there is one thing that I know:
What you reap is what you sow

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, so
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

Brother, mind out what you do
And how you treat your fellow man
If you knew like me you'd try and live
The very best you can
For if you spread good all around
You'll be able to sleep when the sun go down

Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Life is this way, so
Keep movin' on, keep movin' on
Every day

// Let's Go Steady Again //

You left me for a new love
You found out it wasn't a true love
Now that he is gone
Lets go steady one more time

Please don't cry
You've got to be strong, dear
I know he was wrong, dear
But now that he's gone

I know he was wrong to come to the dance
With another girl, the way that he did
I knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
After all, he was once my best friend

Thats all in the past
Let's forget you
He'll never hurt you 
I won't let him
Now that he's gone
Let's go steady one more time

Yes he was wrong to come to the dance
With another girl, the way that he did
I knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
After all, he was once my best friend

Thats all in the past
Let's forget him
He'll never hurt you
I won't let him
Now that he's gone
Let's go steady one more time

// Lonely Island //

I live on a lonely island in the heart of the city
I live on a lonely island there isn't any hope for me
I tell you my heart is broken, it's a shame have pity
I might as well be shipwrecked in the middle of the sea

Nobody will believe me
Nobody seems to care
How lonely, how lonely can you be
I walk around the city
My heart sends out a flare
Baby, baby, baby won't you rescue me

// One Hour Ahead Of The Posse //

One hour ahead of the posse
The bloodhounds are hot on my trail
Last night, I shot my sweetheart
This mornin', I broke outta jail

My Pinto's tired and hungry (Run, run, run, run)
And I'm feeling weary and worn (Run, run, run)
We started ahead of the posse (Run, run, run, run)
And we gotta keep goin' on (Run, run, run)

The sheriff, I swore he would get me
He's ridin' with twenty and five
But I'm not afraid of that posse
They never will get me alive

One hour ahead of the posse (Run, run, run, run)
No turnin' to left or to right (Run, run, run)
We must win the race to the river (Run, run, run, run)
Or there'll be a hanging tonight (Run, run, run)

One hour ahead of the posse
No time for remorse or regret
But somehow, her eyes still haunt me
Her laughter is taunting me yet

It started the night that I met her (Run, run, run, run)
She kissed me and vowed she would care (Run, run, run)
I traded the gold in my pocket (Run, run, run, run)
To fondle the curls in her hair (Run, run, run)

She lied when she said that she loved me
She lied with each kiss that she gave
She lied 'til the moment I caught her
And now, she lies still in her grave

One hour ahead of the posse (Run, run, run, run)
The night is a-coming on fast (Run, run, run)
Oh, we must win the race to the Rio (Run, run, run, run)
And we'll shake that posse at last (Run, run, run)

We're nearing the end of our journey
And now, I'm in sight of my goal
At last, we have beaten the posse
[*gun shot in background*]
May the Lord have mercy on my soul

(May the Lord have mercy on his soul)

// Rome (Wasn't Built In A Day) //

Don't, honey don't, go away, no no
Don't you hear, don't you hear,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day

Now, you know that I love you dear with all my heart
I know that you didn't love me from the start
But I planted a lil' seed in your heart I know
And it just needs time to grow, baby

Don't, honey don't, go away, no no
Don't you hear, don't you hear,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day
Listen to me honey now

How would Romeo feel if his Juliet
Had turned down his advances and played hard to get
He wouldn't have let this bother him, this I know
Because where there's light there's hope
Oh!

Baby, don't go away, no no
Don't you hear now, don't you hear now,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day

Don't you hear me telling you that
Rome wasn't built in a day
Don't you realize that
Rome wasn't built in a day

// Sittin' In The Sun //

Sittin' in the sun counting my money
fanned by my summer-breeze
Sweeter than the honey is counting my money
Those greenbacks on the trees
Comes the summer shower drops of rain falling
Sweeter than the christ-mass chimes
And here on those jungles upon the roof shingles
Like pennies, nickles and dimes

Though it is knows that what I own
is not a lot to move
fills of gold that I behold
are in my bank-account,
I'm sitting in the sun
counting my money
happy as can be
and to top it all when shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
there's a silver dollar
in the sky shining down on me

Can you wonder why I'm in
sittin' in the sun
counting my money
happy as can be
and to top it all when shadows fall
I look to heaven and I see
there's a silver dollar
in the sky shining down on me

// So Glamorous //

So glamorous
My darling, you are so glamorous
You're so exciting, so adorable
And I'm so in love with you, with you

And woah oh oh, you're so wonderful
To me, you are so wonderful
You're so exciting, so alluring
And I'm so in love with you

In school, I sit behind you
You never notice me
If you'd only turn and smile
How happy I would be
But when I'm face to face with you
I'm completely lost
Is it that I haven't the nerve
Or is it because

You're so beautiful
To me, you are so beautiful
You're so exciting, you're so wonderful
And I'm so in love with you

In school, I sit behind you
You never notice me
If you'd only turn and smile
How happy I would be
But when I'm face to face with you
I'm completely lost
Is it that I haven't the nerve
Or is it because

You're so beautiful
To me, you are so beautiful
You're so exciting, you're so wonderful
And I'm so in love with you

// Steal Away //

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

My Lord he calls me, he calls me by the thunder
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Green trees bending
Poor man, he stands trembling
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home
Steal away, steal away
I ain't got long to stay here (O, I ain't got long to stay here)

Steal away, steal away, steal away
Steal away home.

// Teenage Sonata //

Here, here in the moonlight
Hold me while I sing to you
My teenage sonata
Of my love
Eternally true
It's written and filled with devotion
From deep in my heart
And with my teenage sonata
Comes a prayer that we'll never part

And as long as we love it will stay
We'll hear it on our wedding day

My lips can only kiss you
They can explain how you make me feel
But my teenage sonata
Will tell you that my love is real
My love is real
My love is real

// The Piper //

Up and down and through the town
The Piper plays today
Doors and windows open wide
To greet him on his way

He's dressed all up in little boots
And green and yellow clothes
And when he plays his little harp
Away your trouble goes

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way

He goes off through each little town
And upon his harp he plays
And if you have a troubled heart
He'll wipe it right away

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way

Up and down and through the town
The Piper plays today
Doors and windows open wide
To greet him on his way

Hi, everybody
I didn't come to stay
I just came to let you know
The Piper's on his way

// The Riddle Song //

I gave my love a cherry that had no stone
I gave my love a chicken that had no bone
I gave my love a ring that had no end
I gave my love a baby with no cryin'

How can there be a cherry that has no stone
How can there be a chicken that has no bone
How can there be a ring that has no end
How can there be a baby with no cryin'

A cherry when it's bloomin', it has no stone
A chicken when it's pippin' ain't got no bone
A ring when it's rollin', it has no end
And oh, a baby when it's sleepin', there's no cryin'

A baby when it's sleepin'
There's no cryin'

// There'll Be No Second Time //

You done me wrong
I tried to be kind baby
'Cause you told me you were mine o mine
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no second time

I was a fool to give my love
Cause you swore you'd love me
By the stars above
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

Go on and laugh and have your fun
Let the good times keep rollin' on
There'll come a day
When you have to pay
For everything that you done wrong, baby

You can cry, you can rave
Try to show you love me
In a, a million ways
But you walked out and left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

Go on and laugh and have your fun
Let the good times keep rollin' on
There'll come a day
When you have to pay
For everything that you done wrong
Listen to me

You can cry, you can rave
Try to show you love me
In a, a million ways
But you walked out left me behind
So there'll be no, no second time

No doubt certainly there'll be no second time

// What Do You Say //

If you love somebody the way that I do
And your heart is hoping she feels that way too
You're longing to ask her, you're longing to know, oh
But what do you say if her answer is no?

There's so much to tell her, so much to say
But how can I tell her, when I'm so afraid
That she might not love me, and if this is so, oh
What do I say if her answer is no?

What do you say when your dreams disappear
And all that you've planned fades from view?
And oh, what do you say when your eyes fill with tears
And your heart is breaking in two, woah oh

Tonight I will tell her the way that I feel
I think that she knows, for it's hard to conceal
If she says she loves me, my whole world will glow, oh
But what will I say if her answer is no?

// Yeah Man //

Do you like good music
Crazy 'bout music
Any old music
Yeah, yeah
Do you like all the dances
You crazy 'bout the dances

As long as they are swinging
What, what
Let's try some others dances
I don't know which one
Let's try to do the monkey
All right, yeah

Do you like all the dances
I'm crazy 'bout the dances
Let's try a new dance
Let's try the watutsi
I love to do the tutsi
Put the twist with the tutsi

Let's try a new dance
Dig what I tell you
Got to do what I tell you

You're on a football field
You're down in the huddle
Run for that touchdown
You're on a baseball field now
Your bat's in your hand now
Swing for that homerun

You're in the middle of an ocean
Ship had gone done now
Swim our life now
Swim, swim, got to go
I'm going home

// You Understand Me //

Why do I love to walk with you?
To walk and talk with you?
Why do I feel that certain glow?
Why do I feel a thrill with you
Just sittin' still with you?

I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

'Cause you understand me
Yes, you understand me
You know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Exactly what I'm feelin'
I never have to say a word
A solitary word

'Cause you get the message
Yes, you get the message
No, you know exactly what I'm dreamin'
When stars are brightly gleamin'
Like no one in the world, the whole wide world
You understand me

Why do I love to date with you?
To stay up late with you?
Cuddling when the lights are low?
Why you're such a part of me?
Deep in the heart of me?

I know, I know
You bet your pretty life I know

You get the message
Yes, you get the message
Oh, you know exactly what I'm dreamin'
When stars are brightly gleamin'
Like no one in the world, the whole wide world
You understand me

I know, I know, I know, I know you understand me
Mmm, you understand me
I know, I know, I know you understand me

// You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You //

You're nobody till somebody loves you
Oh, you're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king
You may possess the world and its gold
But that gold won't bring you happiness
When you are growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As long as the stars shine above
You got to remember that you're nobody
Nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

The world stays the same
You'll never change it
You'll never change it, no no no
As long as the stars shine above
But you got to remember you' re nobody
Till somebody loves you
So go on out and find someone to love
Take my advice and go on out and find
Someone to love
