Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry from what you won't ever find

Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you down
Dancing around, folds in the gown

Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow

Bones blood and teeth erode
With every crashing node

Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you down
Down towards the ground, gravity smiled

You barely are blinking
Wagging your face around
When'd this just become a mortal home?

Won't, won't, won't, won't, won't let you talk me
Won't let you talk me down
Will pull it taut, nothing let out
