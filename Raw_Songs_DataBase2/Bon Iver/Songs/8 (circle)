Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing

Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue

I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in

Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized at the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour

I will run
(All around it)
Have to crawl
(Still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
Imma make it half the night
Hall light wishes

To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming

I will run (all around it) (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it) (carry off and up your seize)
Along the fires
Carry up love along unfettered time
Now, Mona

Haven't I locked up my failures (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
(From the core to the sky)
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seize)
(From the door till we die)
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Atonements defined (was it all I could find?) (we live outside)
Keep waking up high
