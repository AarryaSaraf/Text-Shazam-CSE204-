(If you wait it won't be undone)

Well it's all just scared of dying
But isn't this a beach?
And if I know one thing at all
Is I cannot just be a peach
Oh, you come in all woke now
So, please enjoy the feast
We are weightless like a wayless beast
So what is it we don't teach?!

When we were children, we were hell bent
Or oblivious at least
But now it comes to mind
We are terrified
So we run and hide
For a verified little peace

So what of this release?
Sun light feels good now, don't it?
I don't have a leaving plan
But something's gotta ease your mind
But it's all fine or it's all crime any way

There were 6 of us sitting creek side
Sifting fistfuls through the green
Every which way could be seen
Was the sand and time
Not a pantomime
More like anodyne
Was a friend of mine
You don't know, you don't know

I could prophet
I could rob, bye bye, however
Everywhere isn't everywhere
This not a veil
Or a fairytale in the least

So what of this release?
Some life feels good now, don't it?
Don't have to have a leaving plan
Nothing's gonna ease your mind
Well it's all fine and we're all fine any way

(But if you wait it won't be undone)
