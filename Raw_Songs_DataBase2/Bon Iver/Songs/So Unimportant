Don't look down
Hold up your head now
Hang on to your honor
Don't know why I've compromised you the most

You pull it closer
Don't make it hard now
If I remember one thing
It's that I don't surprise you at all
Anymore

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape to?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight

All eyes ahead
It's sadder at the end
I drink till I'm falling down
And I'm hanging on by a thread

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape to?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight
