Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new

Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new

Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new
