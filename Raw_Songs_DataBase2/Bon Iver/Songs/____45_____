Well I've been caught in fire
I've been carved in fire
I've been caught in fire
What comes prior to?

I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
Fire
(Fire)
