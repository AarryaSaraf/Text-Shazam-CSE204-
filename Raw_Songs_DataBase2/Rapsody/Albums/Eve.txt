Album: Eve

// Nina //

[Rapsody & Nina Simone:]
Southern trees, bearing strange fruit
Blood on the leaves (Blood on the leaves)
And blood at the roots (And blood at the roots)
Check
So bleed

[Rapsody:]
Emit light rap, or emit Till
I drew a line without showing my body, that's a skill
Bad to the bone and the grill
You'd be dead wrong if looks kill
I'm still on my spiel, in the spirit of L Hill
Eye on the sparrow
Nose like a pharaoh's
Our blood line trill
For the young and all the Lil's
We all gon' get meals
Talk a lotta game
But we get paid too, like Jemele
Was raised upon a hill, the valley's a sunken place
I'm just tryna build like I came with some kettle weight
Know I'm a God MC, 'cause nigga, I made the devil wait
Before I brought hill, you ain't gotta tell me I'm hella great
I don't speak on it nowadays, I just meditate
Y'all can have the bars nigga, I spit hard metal gates
Henry Louis Gates when I cop me some new estate (Cop)
Make room for myself, I'm in a way different mental place
I keep it real, all y'all look anime
I'm fine like Anna Mae
Black don't crack like Angela
Black and brave like in the A
It don't come with apologies
Let's just tip in some Andre
When you greet me it's "Namaste"
Spread love the Brooklyn way or like marmalade
No matter if you street street, or more like the promenade
We gotta come together like the corn and the dookie braids
For the present and future days, I say what I gotta say
I am Nina and Roberta, the one you love but ain't heard of
Got my middle finger up like Pac after attempted murder
Failed to kill me, it's still me
Woke up singing Shirley Murdock
As we lay these edges down, brown women, we so perfect
Went from field nigga to still nigga
Being cropped out the picture
But we all know who got the juice, my sisters
Imitating us in all the Hollywood pictures
And still, they'll never be us, nigga, nigga
I'm from the back woods where Nina would
Sing about the life we should lead
A new dawn, another deed, I try to do some good
I felt more damned than Mississippi was
They deny Nina in Philadelphia
And still we persevere like all the 400 years of our own blood
Africa, old panthers lookin' back like who gon' come up after us?
Outside the movies, I make sure before it move you
It moved me, now bow down to a queen please
Survival...

Here's to the honey in you, to the bittersweet in me
I will shed this blood so romantically, so viciously, quiet
Here's to a moment of silence
I've poured and poured my soul again, here's to epiphanies
There was never a we, there was a you all and there was me
And this war, likely to succeed
Unlike me to surrender
Trying and dying to breathe poetry to rise the light of day
To subconsciously exist cautiously ascending towards freedom
Praying for a breather
Do you see my pain?
Do I seem like prey?
Empathy be the reason you're still standing
We are not the same
I've lived more lives than you, I have less pride than you
I'm extra-terrestrial, I was created different
I've been here many times before and I've never been defeated
And still, I will never be defeated (Defeated)

// Cleo //

To my real ones that know, this ain't for you
To my enemies, it's still love all day
Everybody's still growing and learning themselves, right?
My true story, yo

Pondering, pondering how to approach
Some of y'all sensitive, but y'all still need to know (Yeah)
Wonder how a bunch of sheep can have opinions on a G.O.A.T. (How?)
We all on the same continent and off the same boat (Right)
Remember early on, y'all ain't treat me all the same though (Uh-huh)
Used to question why the brothers even rocked with me for (Uh)
'Member y'all wondered, used to wonder 'bout Wonder
Question why they'd ever wanna push a black woman
Niggas on my label who ain't want me in the front end
Some sisters in the industry, y'all know y'all was frontin' (I know it)
Dressed too tomboy, rap too lyrical (You said it)
I can say more, the pain would bring a few tears to you (Hurt)
I shed a few, was booed bad in Fort Lauderdale (Uh)
Now I'm boo'd up, they boohoo 'cause I didn't fail
Know who you are, I was told names, never tell
The weight that I carried those summers, I'm never frail
Now they say I ain't elite (Who are they?)
On to the next
I don't take time to address opinions that ain't 9th, Dre, or Jay-Z (Right)
Only rap radars I need are them and the streets (Right)
Be careful, the validations y'all seek (Uh-huh)
I been in them offices, they don't look like you and me (They don't)
I've been in offices that they look like me
I learned lessons 'bout my essence and this industry (Uh)
Y'all banked on the wrong ones, wasted your energy (You did)
Lost more interest, got me laughin' at my enemies
Every door you close, every back you turn (Uh-huh)
Can't keep me away from the life I earned (You can't keep it)
My rock bottom still the high life y'all yearn (It is)
What ain't given, I had to take my turn (Give me that)
Came back, more ammo, like Cleo to burn
Blaow, blaow, blaow, nigga, burn

We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
Money talk, bullshit walk, you dig?
If you aim, you better squeeze
Real ones multiply, chump niggas bleed, you feel me?
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
You can bank on that nigga
Two five two 'comin live from the booger boo basement
For the big faces, nigga

Yo, let's keep it a whole G, and talk about it upfront (Talk)
The best, point blank, period, every month (Talk)
The goals been lowered and we still scared to dunk (Talk)
Y'all don't want no smoke, half the squad roll blunts, hold up
Enough braggin', let's talk about the baggin' (Yeah)
Talk about the money, who in this business they staffin'? (Uh-huh)
Who milk the cows but they never put a calf in (Tell it)
White men run this, they don't want this kind of passion (Talk)
A black woman story, they don't want this kind of rapping (Talk)
They love a fantasy, they love the gun bang action (Talk)
What good is a black women to them? (Yeah)
Raped us in slavery, they raping us again (Yes)
Only put us on TV if our titties jiggling (Uh)
Jay tried to give us Tidals and we giggling at him (Damn shame)
But we ain't peeped the funny shit they doing (Crazy)
Chitlin circuit, mom and pop stores been ruined (Crazy)
'Cause we ain't wanna share the profit we was all movin'
Now it's pennies on pennies, that don't make sense do it? (Dollars)
We gotta stick together more than we has been (Yes, we do)
Beefin' with each other while they get rich laughing (Come on, bruh)
Mmh, that's a no-no (It is)
Bust my way through like Cleo with the ammo (Baow)
On my own terms, I'ma take what's mine
Singin' day after day, you can sing that line (Like Cleo)

We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
And that's a fact, nigga
You see we came up, got our change up, but we ain't change up
In a world full of fake niggas, still remain us
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
Real rap forever
Showin' love to all my strong black queens, you dig?
Fuck what you heard, bow down or get shot down, nigga

Money (Money, money, money)
Get your money
Get the money, money
Better get your money
Get the money, money
Money (Money, money, money)
Gotta get your money
Get the money, money
Better get your money
Get the money, money
Money
(I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
Well, I reme...)

// Aaliyah //

Are you that somebody?

When Aaliyah was alive, it was cool to be a tomboy
Tommy boy fly
Sci-fi tommy boy of cold world, we all tryna survive
Talkin' cold world, where only drugs been supplied
Respect A1 (A1), my drive A5 (A5)
Only plan for some niggas (Yeah) was the plan to stay alive
It's a lost blessing, only a few of my friends died
I know another side of graves, I'm always at a graveside
Bad boys was the only ones I like
Plus my ex boyfriend's all got two strikes (bad boys)
That's at least too lives
I know niggas that double that, got at least two wives (yeah)
And they both got kids (Yeah), and they both age five
That kinda drama, two lives, but Aaliyah ain't alive (Alive)
I wish we gave Aaliyah two lives
To catch this wave that I'm on, you need at least two tides, nigga
I'm bussin' to everybody ride nigga
Still singin' Mary Blige (Real love)
But I've come to realise, real love from somebody ain't about the gift or prize
Are you that somebody? (Yeah) Like Aaliyah prophesied
Are you real? (Are you real?) Back and forth with you guys
I ain't 'bout to argue with none of y'all, today's a good vibe (Yeah)
I'ma treat myself, let me get a supersize
As my cup runneth over, it's fulfilling to me
This ain't E.T. news, I done went sci-fi (Uh huh)
I'm closer to God, I done went sky high
Been alienated so much that I must be fly (Fly)
I am who I am, I don't rock a disguise
To be more than a woman now come with some ties

Are you that somebody?
Are you that somebody?
Yeah, are you that somebody that's gon' keep it real wit' yourself?
Keep it, keep it real, keep it real wit' yourself (Keep it real)
Keep it, keep it real, keep it real wit' yourself (Keep it real)

More than a woman, real enough to rock the boat (Keep it real)
I don't fit the status quo, blow their mind Maseo (Keep it real)
Really fine, I'm like another kinda fine that you should know (Keep it real)
Uh, get you somebody that can still do both (Real)
Back and forth, that's somebody that can play both coasts
Flow Jo, stay in my lane, that's a winner for sure
I don't care what you got to say about me no more (More)
Double dutchin' when I'm talkin' and my back on the ropes (Ropes)
I be chillin', ain't got no feelings when I'm ridin' the slope (Slope)
Skeezer's gon' be skeezers, I'm just dope (Dope)
I'm here to shake the system up, we gon' rock the boat (Boat)
'Cause I'm that somebody that you still need to know, squad

Keep it real, keep it real, keep it real
Keep it real, keep it real, keep it real
For real

They said we wouldn't have shit
Wouldn't last if it was up to white Jesus
Niggas started to believe it, started birthin' and bleedin' it
Oh, the lies y'all sold us, um
This poor love of ours, this gospel we sing
This little shine of mine, I'm gonna let it eat me up, I'm gonna let it kill me
Gonna let it fuck me up till I'm leanin', 'till I'm fiendin', till I'm feelin' better, wow
I kinda feel better now
'Cause I got it now
For me
For him
For her
For my Grandmama who had to pick cotton
And my Granddaddy who got lashed at then laughed at
Who you turned your back on, who you took your turn on for masa
I'm sorry, I'm kinda violent now
Fuckin' tired now
Don't mean to disturb your peace, just needed a little piece of what you got from NASA
Y'all got me hot now
Not asking for permission, came back to see what's good now
Niggas buyin' dreams by the pound, only real niggas sellin'
Only real niggas feel your fear
It's nice I frighten you
It's nice I've inspired you
To look, to think, to act like me
Little, old me?
Little, old me came back to say
We made it

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, it's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

Yeah, stay movin' forward and elevate from the floor
And the old you had big drive, the new you drive like Delorean
Until you do more than luring
The future's important, they tell me, do what you can
Man, I'ma do it like Jordan
Gotta check myself, momma
Told me, just like old Morgan, Freeman
A caged bird sings a song for freedom
Goin' borderline crazy thinkin' 'bout the children
Michael Jackson told us all, get off the wall, back then
Ain't no strings, like Tito, no puppet, Danny DeVito
It's your idle time, get you nowhere, less you Burino
I ain't a new slave, my new wave, the new negro
Ain't on the web, but it's W. E. B, he holds the lock in
No thinkin' toxic, you mis-educated, like Lauren with the 'locks in
If you confuse my boxin' with me being boxed in (never)
It's my native language, ain't gotta say it in Mocassins
Whatever I be rockin' in, I speak the truth, like 222 times 2
That's 444, better than before
Be three times the lady like we sang in Commodores
Knowin' I can't, I can't

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, It's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

I can't be no bird in a cage (I can't be that)
Can't let emotions hold me prison to rage (I can't do that)
Everytime they pop off, I don't even engage (I can't say that)
Knowin' if I act up, I ain't actin' my age (I don't play that)
Some days are Morpheus, other times I'm just like Trey
Which means, some days I need savin', other times I wear the cape
They tell me in due time, when even babies come late
So I'm go for mine cause I ain't got none to waste
Born ready, like I came out in some cleats, double laced
To run the world with, they tell me it's gon' be a long way (it's a long way)
Knock on wood that we make it through the day (that's a long day)
I ain't the one to cross, I left that burden to LeCroix
I got a plot for every block, until I'm king like Luke Cage
It's super, that's my word, the only time the two relate (a caged bird)
So many many many moves to make
And I approach 'em like Michael on the motel stage (hee hee)
I walked the moon before I walk the graves all day
Delay nuttin' sista you ain't got no time to waste, singin'
(I can't) You can't what?
(Control it)

I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
We got the juice, we got the crew
Momma always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage
My bad, I don't run away
Knock on wood, It's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste yourself

I can't, I can't
I can't control it

// Ibtihaj //

Now when the MC's came to live out their name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Now RZA flip the track

Boy, boy you sharp, boy
Look at the fades on you, boy
Ooh, boy, you liquid swords on ya head, boy, wavy

Thinkin' like, back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave

Thinkin' like back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Thinkin' like

Been a long time coming (Been a long time coming)
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa Bees)

It's Been a long time coming (Long, long time)
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa Bees)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa, killa)

When the mc's came to live out their name
Inscribed in the halls and the walls of fame
Balancing life, wrote both the yin and yang
Hands buried the man and they raised the son to reign
That's a play on words, they say herb ain't all the same
Slaves in prison and they some unchained
While everybody in my gang a star DJ Preem
Screaming through the sun roof, "Money Still Ain't a Thing"
While I'm spending small bank, asking "Where is my change?"
Carpool with the homies, saving gas in my tank
I think like a billionaire, I spend less than I make
Strong minded, I should bench way more than I weight
Women been leading the way, since Roxanne Shante
And the Unit had Flava and Jay had Marcy neighbors that waved
Lookin' confused, I be like "Cool, maybe it's age"
When I see afro puffs, I think maybe it's Rage
Maybe it's staged, they trippin' and they say they got beef
Ain't an MC on this Earth that make me feel afraid
Wu-Tang is for the children, that's the scripture and phrase
See, my goals from a birds view, like Trey, under age

Now when the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane since before Pete rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born

Now Gza on the track

When I'm so off the radar, it's very hard to find me
In space, a selfie with the Earth behind me
You follow the leader, the track is off the meter
A lot of rap is weak, low frequency in the tweeters
Very inaudible, clock radio speakers
Quietly whispering is a world of Wiki Leakers
Forget the gaudiness my method is nauseant
Transferring ideas into the brains of the audience
The street poet gave this special art form a global reach
I earned your ear and then your heart by giving the local speech
Weaving wonder with words as potent as a sorcery
Not witchcraft, but a list of terms in the glossary
Well written rap, bound to have a great impact
On a listener for the fact it's well intact
An MC should electrify, beautify, strive to
Empower, inspire, transform a world view

Back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave

Thinkin' like back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Thinkin' like

It's been a long time coming (Long time comin')
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa Bees)

Been a long time coming
Since we had someone swarming with the bees
Birds and the Killa Bees

Now when the MC's came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane since before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Now RZA flip the track

// Myrlie //

[Rapsody:]
Black widow, young kiddo
Tear stained pillow, 'nother black man died
Wade in the water, I don't mean baptized
Dark ass times, can't bat no eye
I see 'em, our BMs
IBM windows, they don't look through ours
We got a fire and it's big like Cali's
But they ain't for us, we ain't Forrest
They only for it, if we servin' time
Butler boys, that's a bigger crime
We gave ours to the rallies, funerals, black Denalis
Can't let a day go by
Esau, she saw, Eric die
We saw people cry, think about all of our people's wives
Raise the kids in the world they know ain't safe to live
Like Myrlie, emergency
The mirror me said I could be her too, the day I say I do

[Mereba:]
Black men bleeding, it's your time
Not so funny, Valentine
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away
Made a widow from a wife
Took the love of my whole life
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away

[Rapsody:]
Yeah
Invisible veil, Coretta wore that, you could see Israel
Martin Luther wasn't a big enough deal?
Trayvon Martin ain't a big enough deal?
I kid you not
How many Martin's we had shot?
Pouring Remy Martin on the block
In memory, documented by the Roc
Yeah, I hope you watched, let's talk about
What Betty did, she saw X die
We saw X die, how Betty did
Now when I exit, for the baby kid
Cry for the baby Mama and the baby crib
That's a broken home, I could be on that
That's reality, that's a big ol' fact
'Cause I'ma marry black, a hard truth
Think about the widows, that could be us too

Myrlie, I miss you Miss Myrlie. Still holding yourself to sleep all night, still drunk off the shit that keeps you up at night. Still feel haunted, still exhausted. I can love you if you needing love Myrlie. Can you love me back?

[Mereba:]
Black men bleeding, it's your time
Not so funny, Valentine
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away
Made a widow from a wife
Took the love of my whole life
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away

// Reyna's Interlude //

An ode to the black woman's body
She's been through a lot
Years and years on end, she chose to keep on
To hold on to love, then to love again
Then to lose to love again
To hug black bodies like it's the last time
Like, last time every time
To bear baby after baby
Praying this time maybe they'll be birthed into safety
Ideally a place where someone can love them
Hoping this time, we can trust each other enough to tell one another our fears
I might start by saying, "I need you"
When you go, I'm afraid to let you
I don't wanna survive alone again
Our bodies have become too familiar
With chance, with each other, with freedom
But never a chance to experience freedom with each other these days
I'm tired of sharing your body between the world and me
So, won't you promise this time, your body will make it home to me
To this love, to this unity
To this journey we're supposed to be on together
Yesterday, tomorrow and forever, today
I'll be waiting for our forever after

Nobody tells you how to survive as a black woman
So let me learn you a lesson
Black women, you are a threat on every point of the map
You are love, in its purest form, all unapologetic, all unconditional
Always too compassionate, sometimes too forgiving
But, never too afraid to show up
Black women, you are everything they knew you wouldn't be
You are gorgeous, even through the suffering
You needn't forget why
You hold the world together
Thank you for your mercy
You are the strongest form of human
Black women

My cherie amor this door awaits for you and I valet for you
I'll fry, barbecue, and fillet for you
Brown shea butter baby
Why you so unavailable to the bullshit?
It's your world, I'm a tourist, I'm foolish though
I know that since the days they treated us like property for trade
It was times where they could come inside and take your soul away
But I'm here for your protection, like a servant
Like an agent or a secret service, some CIA shit
See I ain't okay with the way they tryna portray over the media
Alexandria, Egypt in Africa
Nefertiti was probably black as Roberta Flack back with the 'fro
Checkin' all my facts 'cause I be wrong but I'm passionate though (Ebony)

Queens'll always have your back (Always)
I'm thinking Roberta Flack (Yeah)
First time I ever saw your face I fell in love just like that (I fell in love)
I know your burden gets bad, you take and carry my bags
We cry together, hold you down the days you broken and sad
And I'ma always keep it real, no I don't care if you mad (I don't care)
I'm here to make you better, I'm just like Coretta in fact
See only Kings would understand just how that metaphor match (You dig)
Latifah still a Queen, I'm just tryna follow her path (You dig)
A long walk to freedom, Winnie fought through all of the wrath
I got a number if you want it, I got all of the math
All my hoodlums, I think all of us are good ones, Saint Claire

You gotta love your Queen 'cause God knows that you need her, it's real (It's real)
U-N-I-T-Y

[Queen Latifah:]
Even living single we connected by the tribe
Was raised by a Queen, know how to be one
And love one and raise a King
When he's older I'll describe how to love 'em
Queens come in all shapes and colors
Though we sit on thrones we don't look down on each other
I learned how to rule from my mother and my aunties
Got the blood of the Asante
I could be Cleo or Ghandi to protect mine
It's peace of mind, word to Jersey
I'm a giant, a Queen's pride stronger than the lions
Connected by alliance, sisterhood
The day you try to test me, look homie I wish you would
Open doors for the ladies as a Queen like I should
That's why I'm Queen Latifah in every village, every hood
And I'm good, and every city worldwide
And why I been reigning for the last twenty five
So all hail the Queens and the next ones to arrive
Came out of Jersey with naughty dudes and hella drive
Just another day above ground working my thighs, we runnin' it
Member the days me and 'Pac, we had some fun with this
When I would bust you dead in your eye, that's called humblin'
Been holding the torch, I don't fumble it
I'm a child of God versus son of men, tellin' 'em
It's a clear shot to the top and I ain't talking guns and gin
Just so all the Queens know that every single one of them
Has a throne, spot, crown that I been proud to rock
All my blood royal and that's word to Lancelot
From the soil to the sun, you stunned, it ain't no shock
Another black reign, came to water and nourish the crop
That's why we flourish on top
Just call us Queens (Call us Queens)
Yeah, yeah, ha

Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride

Yeah, look
Born into pain, alcoholic veins
Over-analytical brain a product of the shame
And runnin' from a past, that's checkered like the game
Somewhere 'long the way somebody snatched my peace and main
Maybe that's the reason I spent decades seekin' fame
And fortune hopin' that a proper portion would contain
The sadness in my eyes, remember when I came
In this music business, all their questions was insane
"Why you never smile in your pictures?" I refrain
From givin' you the answer 'cause that answer wasn't plain
Enough for me to see 'cause at the time I knew my name
But didn't know myself, and so I dealt with shit the same
As a fugitive, but running from the truth and shit
I shoot the shit with niggas, but they never loop the shit that's hidden deep
Within the crevices like ever since I was a child
Seen my mama with the pistol pointed at her dome and how
In the fuck do you expect for me to ever be the best lil' me
That I can be, when trauma's deep inside of me, like I.V. fluid Pumpin' through the blood of wifey, while she's givin' birth
To my child, I know my thoughts are runnin' wild
Bear with my style, this just a trial run
Just heard these kids don't know 'bout Malcolm
And I'm sort of heartbroken 'cause the elders lost hope in our youth
And here I sit dead in the middle not a little boy no more
But not quite old yet, wakin' up in cold sweats
Scared that I'm too disconnected from the kids' perspective
The world ain't got no patience for some shit that's introspective So where in the fuck that leave me? Irrelevant, I guess
Went from Heaven-sent to hella bent, intelligent but stressed, damn

Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride

[Rapsody:]
One more time
Swim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)
Every day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Yeah)
Yeah, swim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)
Every day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Uh)

Permanent vacation for forever
Some things you gotta leave behind, some people just like weather
And seasons, for that reason, I know I'll always have a leg up
Weatherman forecast me dead last, think I'm just another nigga
Maybe, I'll be the next Black Beatle like Swae Lee
Yeah, I know my worth, these colonizers got to pay me
Yeah, I had to go first 'cause the rest would never last
I had to show the positives for those that couldn't add
Lookin' at the ads, they only love us if our ass
Out and so I'm out, I got an Audi and it's bad
I said that line 'cause niggas only respect you if you brag
It don't work with me the same, don't give a fuck 'bout what you have
Everybody claimin' boss, none of you niggas got no staff
It don't measure up the same, what's a quarter to a half?
Of a whole lot of problems, nigga, who taught you to add?
Where I'm from, we don't recognize that it's good math
If you don't teach the ones that's comin' up to multiply their cash
Think for themselves, think beyond sales
Everything with worth don't come with some whistles and some bells
Some ones you gotta leave behind, some ones you gotta bail
Meek Mill, I'm workin' hard, ain't too far from a meek mil'
To keep it real, the realest niggas I know always kept it real
And I'ma tell you, Black-on-Black murder been whack
9th, turn me up so they can hear me in the back
Yeah, and that's pretty hard for me
But you see hopeful niggas and where they all ought to be
Scared to grow wings, Birdman with a bunch of Carter beef
That's old news, nigga, you talkin' to modern me
Smarter, we had better conversations sittin' with barbers
Puttin' hearts and heads in niggas who don't think ahead, who taught you?
School y'all, school y'all, welcome to the schoolyard
Teach you how to make moves without needin' a UHAUL
I was on you all when I was growin' up
Now it's you all that's all on these nuts
I'm ballin', havin' a ball and I got the balls to say it
Who needs inspiration where you know when you can play it?
Carolina to the heart, nobody here gon' play us
The day that we expire, Carolina's where they'll lay us
I woke up feelin' like Aaliyah, yeah, a million and one bucks
Told these niggas I don't give a single million and one fuck, Rap

Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?

My brothers (My brothers), I love you (I love you)
I hate to know some of you treat us like Glover (Glover)
Black card revoked, maybe you could use Discover (Discover)
Define yourself, do you feel the same way 'bout your mother? (Mother)
Do you overlook our beauty, but you lovin' on all the others (Others)
Hope you teach your daughters all to stay away from suckas
Like yourself if you don't love yourself
I'm so Southern (Southern), I was taught to feed the soul with or without hot ovens
Here's a plate, know your hate come from a black man struggle (Struggle)
We all in the same shape, so I know I fit your puzzle (Puzzle)
Either way, we got your back, we only pray you'll be our muscle (Pray you'll be our muscle)
Strength in the times we all overcome with trouble
Every day we pullin' doubles for ourself and home (For ourself and home)
My mom and daddy taught me, early on, protect your own (Protect your own)
We never stopped lovin' you, so turn your love back on (Your love back on)
And I pray you feel the same way as that 2Pac song
We ain't your hoes or your bitches, trophies, or meant for pimpin'
Recognize a gift from God outweighs a birthday or a Christmas
To protect our lives, you gon' take it to the limit? (You gon' take it to the limit?)
Rib of my rib, do you still feel us in ya

(Now since we all came from a woman

They should never take what's never given to 'em 'cause they want it (Want it)
I was taught, if you love me, you would never cut the corners (Corners)
What we made in the night, we got a raise in the mornin' (Mornin')
This is sucka niggas warnin', you should never hit a woman (Woman)
We should have some things in common
Just like Common, he respect us
A law is not a lecture, how you love us it affect us (It affect us)
I ain't playin' the middle like Nadeska
It ain't complex to be emotional or affectionate
To my brothers that do, I hope my sisters don't think less of 'em (Don't think less of 'em)
2Pac gone, you know Rap had to message him
We tried to do our best for them, mother panther vibes (Panther vibes)
We need strong men, so our baby boys survive (Baby boys survive)
Love our great fathers, I know some statistics lied
But all the ones that didn't, yo, you gotta do your job
I know this life ain't easy, every one of us is flawed (Flawed)
At least love your woman, we the closest thing to God (God)
And tell her keep her head up, every day that it gets hard (Gets hard)
If you truly recognize that

(Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
Now since we all)

[PJ Morton:]
I know I wouldn't be nothing (Nothing)
Without you by my side (Side)
You have always been the savior, you're the closest thing to God
So, I just want to thank you (Thank ya), for bein' so good to me
And I apologize, for not always bein' what I'm supposed to be
I just wanted to write this letter, I promise, I'm gonna do better

I don't know where I would be (Be)
If you weren't here with me (Me)
If you don't hear anybody else sayin'
Please know you're appreciated ('Ated)
The way you walk, way you talk so fine (Fine)
And ooh, you got a brilliant mind (Brilliant mind)
There ain't nobody better (Better)
Each and every one of you matter to me

Come here, let me untwist your hair and massage your head. Let me pick your brain. I wanna let you into this safe space I hold and keep sacred for you. I know you are kind of hurt. I kinda wish I could take the pain away from you. I seen how the Devil likes to have his way with you. I felt their hate for you. Their innate ways to fake and play with you in this life you were given, over this nightmare you are livin', pardon them for not seein' your purpose, but for what it's worth. We're in this life thing together, so can't you love me deeper than that? Like God intended you to? Can't you remember where you came from, like you ain't came from my seed of love? Your broken spirit can't always be the excuse. Thought I taught you the gravity of respect and paying dues, thought you knew. My God don't like ugly. My God said she need an apology. Needs to know you see all the beauty she created. Needs you to know wouldn't be no you if it wasn't for us. My God said, "How much harder we gotta love you?"
