I got a Day One like Day-Day that pull up on a Friday
Like get yo' ass up we bout to party
Another one that's always praying for me cause she godly
And a few that throw hands in my name if you try me
Dara know my dirt and she keep it under rug
Kash tell it like it is
Pat used to give me cash when I ain't have a cent
Netta taught me how to pop the wop
Nique held me down when my temp got hella hot
Joya hugged me tight when I cried over dumb dudes
Marcus always lied when I used to skip school
Almost got arrested, we was actin' a fool
Few Day Ones I don't even talk to
If you don't know my mama then you just a debut
Newcomer trying to act like you really paid dues
You ain't seen me at my worst
Ain't dropped everything when I called
Had genuine love since the first Day One

Ohh
I've been there I've been there I've been broken like you
Changed my hair what I wear and my whole attitude
When you're strong but you're scared you've got so much to prove
It takes time

My day one friend
If you want to party
All you do is call me
I will be there
My day one friend
When you're feeling lonely
You don't have to worry
I have been there

Celebrate, celebrate
Caviar and your smile
Pour the wine, more champagne
Tell non-sinners we tried
Good cigars, single malt
We've no secrets to hide
From each other
From each other
Oh yeah

Took a drive up the coast
Dipped my toes in the bay
Turned it off all the things
Still to do and to say
Pour some out, a Salud
If you never knew pain then what's pleasure

My day one friend
If you want to party
All you do is call me
I will be there
My day one friend
When you're feeling lonely
You don't have to worry
I have been there

Don't I know
Don't I know
Don't I know
Don't I know
My sister
Oh yeah
Don't I know
Don't I know
Don't I know
Don't I know

My day one friend

My day one friend
If you want to party
All you do is call me
I will be there
My day one friend
When you're feeling lonely
You don't have to worry
