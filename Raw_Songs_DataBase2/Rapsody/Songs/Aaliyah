Are you that somebody?

When Aaliyah was alive, it was cool to be a tomboy
Tommy boy fly
Sci-fi tommy boy of cold world, we all tryna survive
Talkin' cold world, where only drugs been supplied
Respect A1 (A1), my drive A5 (A5)
Only plan for some niggas (Yeah) was the plan to stay alive
It's a lost blessing, only a few of my friends died
I know another side of graves, I'm always at a graveside
Bad boys was the only ones I like
Plus my ex boyfriend's all got two strikes (bad boys)
That's at least too lives
I know niggas that double that, got at least two wives (yeah)
And they both got kids (Yeah), and they both age five
That kinda drama, two lives, but Aaliyah ain't alive (Alive)
I wish we gave Aaliyah two lives
To catch this wave that I'm on, you need at least two tides, nigga
I'm bussin' to everybody ride nigga
Still singin' Mary Blige (Real love)
But I've come to realise, real love from somebody ain't about the gift or prize
Are you that somebody? (Yeah) Like Aaliyah prophesied
Are you real? (Are you real?) Back and forth with you guys
I ain't 'bout to argue with none of y'all, today's a good vibe (Yeah)
I'ma treat myself, let me get a supersize
As my cup runneth over, it's fulfilling to me
This ain't E.T. news, I done went sci-fi (Uh huh)
I'm closer to God, I done went sky high
Been alienated so much that I must be fly (Fly)
I am who I am, I don't rock a disguise
To be more than a woman now come with some ties

Are you that somebody?
Are you that somebody?
Yeah, are you that somebody that's gon' keep it real wit' yourself?
Keep it, keep it real, keep it real wit' yourself (Keep it real)
Keep it, keep it real, keep it real wit' yourself (Keep it real)

More than a woman, real enough to rock the boat (Keep it real)
I don't fit the status quo, blow their mind Maseo (Keep it real)
Really fine, I'm like another kinda fine that you should know (Keep it real)
Uh, get you somebody that can still do both (Real)
Back and forth, that's somebody that can play both coasts
Flow Jo, stay in my lane, that's a winner for sure
I don't care what you got to say about me no more (More)
Double dutchin' when I'm talkin' and my back on the ropes (Ropes)
I be chillin', ain't got no feelings when I'm ridin' the slope (Slope)
Skeezer's gon' be skeezers, I'm just dope (Dope)
I'm here to shake the system up, we gon' rock the boat (Boat)
'Cause I'm that somebody that you still need to know, squad

Keep it real, keep it real, keep it real
Keep it real, keep it real, keep it real
For real
