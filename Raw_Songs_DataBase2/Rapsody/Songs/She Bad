Bad, she's bad, bad
Okie dokie
She bad

Can't play nice, this my life, this is life
Roll my dice, who want fight? I might go Mike Tys
Won't fail twice, pay my price, why my sun so bright
Diamonds nice, ain't got charm, my world feel like ice
Use my arms, I ain't armed but I got her, right?
You the type to run your mouth, get knocked out on sight
Bithc I'm bad, been through shit but I bounce right back
Laugh, then I do the dab, leave you deadbeat like his dad
Huh, here I go, hitch feel like a pistol blow
Leila Ali against the ropes, fight my way to the top floor
Been through the dark, this a nice glow
Mode always survival, I aim to take our your vidals
Yeah, I put that on the bible

She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Yeah, she bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bitch, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad

Oh shit, got my focus back
Oh shit, we don't doubkle back
I'm so rich I need a duffle bag
And an armour truck that's armour backed
Got big dreams, need big rings
'Til it ding ding, and the big ring
Money on my mind and it's uzi pink
Put the drop on him, lucas mink
Metaphor for a knockout
Blows feel like the top down
Two M's, I don't need a crown
That's the Meagan flow, they insecure now
My skin color, Pac brown
If they durag, we gon' knock 'em down
Make 'em studder back, like a chopper sound
Tensed up like a cop around
They say scared money don't make money
M, y momma ain't make a dummy
Gotta fight for it, can't take it for me
I shit like when the day is coming

Say sumn, betcha won't (I wish you would)
But if you do (What nigga?)
Bitch, it's on

Get yo' beat down like Fruity Loops
If you want smoke like hooty-hoo
I'm a outcast, this a musical
Let it hum to you like Jigga do
Let's square it up like a Rubix cube
The respect ain't mutual
Ya'll disrespect, I'll diss ya too
So the beat down is additional

She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Yeah, she bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
She bad, bad, bad, bad
Bitch, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad
