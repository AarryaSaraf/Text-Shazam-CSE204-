Ooh... yeah

(Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
Now since we all)


My brothers (My brothers), I love you (I love you)
I hate to know some of you treat us like Glover (Glover)
Black card revoked, maybe you could use Discover (Discover)
Define yourself, do you feel the same way 'bout your mother? (Mother)
Do you overlook our beauty, but you lovin' on all the others (Others)
Hope you teach your daughters all to stay away from suckas
Like yourself if you don't love yourself
I'm so Southern (Southern), I was taught to feed the soul with or without hot ovens
Here's a plate, know your hate come from a black man struggle (Struggle)
We all in the same shape, so I know I fit your puzzle (Puzzle)
Either way, we got your back, we only pray you'll be our muscle (Pray you'll be our muscle)
Strength in the times we all overcome with trouble
Every day we pullin' doubles for ourself and home (For ourself and home)
My mom and daddy taught me, early on, protect your own (Protect your own)
We never stopped lovin' you, so turn your love back on (Your love back on)
And I pray you feel the same way as that 2Pac song
We ain't your hoes or your bitches, trophies, or meant for pimpin'
Recognize a gift from God outweighs a birthday or a Christmas
To protect our lives, you gon' take it to the limit? (You gon' take it to the limit?)
Rib of my rib, do you still feel us in ya?

(Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
Now since we all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?)


I don't know where I would be (Be)
If you weren't here with me (Me)
If you don't hear anybody else sayin'
Please know you're appreciated ('Ated)
The way you walk, way you talk so fine (Fine)
And ooh, you got a brilliant mind (Brilliant mind)
There ain't nobody better (Better)
Each and every one of you matter to me (Listen)


May I present this conversation starter (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Just picture a single mister, tryna to raise a daughter
Envision him planning summer trips, take her to raging waters
Challenges of July made this father afraid of August
Martyr, he'd gladly be presented with danger
And every scar that he could prevent was a gift to his angel
Mr. Incredible
She put him on pedestal
'Cause words of affirmation from her father were medical
Now picture that same hero deranged and calling her out her name
Talk is either a toxin or tonic, monitor whether or not you servin' elixirs or painting pictures of pain
Our position protected, that coward shit is for lames
Listen
Because I got my game from a woman and my name from a woman
I'd be willing to change for a woman
I'd pull a couple strings for a woman
Go ahead and make it a fair exchange for a woman
Listen
Women are gifted with the capacity to make something of nothing
That's nothing short of miraculous
Her love is a gift and that's likely right where her passion is
Her touch and her kiss can't be taken lightly, let's rally for our women

(We all came from a woman
Got our names from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?)
(Dear Women)


I know I wouldn't be nothing (Nothing)
Without you by my side (Side)
You have always been the savior, you're the closest thing to God
So, I just want to thank you (Thank ya), for bein' so good to me
And I apologize, for not always bein' what I'm supposed to be (Be)
I just wanted to write this letter (Letter), I promise, I'm gonna do better

I don't know where I would be (Be)
If you weren't here with me (Me)
If you don't hear anybody else sayin'
Please know you're appreciated ('Ated)
The way you walk, way you talk so fine (Fine)
And ooh, you got a brilliant mind (Brilliant mind)
There ain't nobody better (Better)
Each and every one of you matter to me (To me, yeah)
