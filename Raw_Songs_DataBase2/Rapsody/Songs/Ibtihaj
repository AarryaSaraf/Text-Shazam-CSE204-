Now when the MC's came to live out their name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Now RZA flip the track

Boy, boy you sharp, boy
Look at the fades on you, boy
Ooh, boy, you liquid swords on ya head, boy, wavy

Thinkin' like, back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave

Thinkin' like back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Thinkin' like

Been a long time coming (Been a long time coming)
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa Bees)

It's Been a long time coming (Long, long time)
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa Bees)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa, killa)

When the mc's came to live out their name
Inscribed in the halls and the walls of fame
Balancing life, wrote both the yin and yang
Hands buried the man and they raised the son to reign
That's a play on words, they say herb ain't all the same
Slaves in prison and they some unchained
While everybody in my gang a star DJ Preem
Screaming through the sun roof, "Money Still Ain't a Thing"
While I'm spending small bank, asking "Where is my change?"
Carpool with the homies, saving gas in my tank
I think like a billionaire, I spend less than I make
Strong minded, I should bench way more than I weight
Women been leading the way, since Roxanne Shante
And the Unit had Flava and Jay had Marcy neighbors that waved
Lookin' confused, I be like "Cool, maybe it's age"
When I see afro puffs, I think maybe it's Rage
Maybe it's staged, they trippin' and they say they got beef
Ain't an MC on this Earth that make me feel afraid
Wu-Tang is for the children, that's the scripture and phrase
See, my goals from a birds view, like Trey, under age

Now when the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane since before Pete rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born

Now Gza on the track

When I'm so off the radar, it's very hard to find me
In space, a selfie with the Earth behind me
You follow the leader, the track is off the meter
A lot of rap is weak, low frequency in the tweeters
Very inaudible, clock radio speakers
Quietly whispering is a world of Wiki Leakers
Forget the gaudiness my method is nauseant
Transferring ideas into the brains of the audience
The street poet gave this special art form a global reach
I earned your ear and then your heart by giving the local speech
Weaving wonder with words as potent as a sorcery
Not witchcraft, but a list of terms in the glossary
Well written rap, bound to have a great impact
On a listener for the fact it's well intact
An MC should electrify, beautify, strive to
Empower, inspire, transform a world view

Back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave

Thinkin' like back in the days when niggas wore fades
Silk tie caps, just tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Tryna catch a wave
Thinkin' like

It's been a long time coming (Long time comin')
Since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killa)
Birds and the Killa Bees (Killa Bees)

Been a long time coming
Since we had someone swarming with the bees
Birds and the Killa Bees

Now when the MC's came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane since before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Now RZA flip the track
