You can blame me for a lot of wrongs that I've done here
Checking your phone wondering who has called here
And when you gone, I be wondering who you chilling with
Insecurities steam emotions from past relationships
Highly insecure when all ever you do fill me with
Compliments of how no one touching me on this continent
Guess I need to trust you more, fucking find me some confidence
So I be silent
Arguing or faking it, thinking its on some hating shit
Really I'm just passionate hoping you know you mean a bit
Lot to me, Lottery of all the a million picture number one, know I be tripping but where its coming from
I did hard, told myself nothing like that you play smart
And what I do,
Oh heart! Save me I'm guilty of being in love
I miss us
Guilty of doing things for attention
Social networks, I be wondering who you friending
Call your guy friends who drafting 'bout your interests
Checking his story, I'm making sure that the end is the same
And what you told me last night ain't been changed
I'm guilty, of loving you dangerously I put you through this bullshit
I'm sorry, don't wanna lose you like Harley lost Azea
I pray, forgive me my despair
What I have broken may we repair
