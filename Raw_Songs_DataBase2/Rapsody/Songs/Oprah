I need them dollars
Run me my half or I'll put a hole in your wallet
Cold case on my waist, you don't want these problems
Bank called said they runnin' out of commas
That's on my mama
I'm steady mobbin', posted up till I reach my profit
Margin, cash money and I ain't, I ain't in two thousand
Hustler, don't you hear my stomach growlin'?
Bitch, I'm 'bout it, I'm hungry
So I need them tender greens spillin' off my plate
Cash on delivery, bitch, I raise the stakes
You will hate what I fuckin' make
Just to pop out and I don't even show my face, oh yeah
To count it all, gon' take about a minute
Don't claim the gang, ho, if you know you not with it
Marijuana scented, windows tinted, keep it low
'Cause you know these niggas can't wait to print it, oh yeah

They said we wouldn't have shit
Wouldn't last if it was up to white Jesus
Niggas started to believe it, started birthin' and bleedin' it
Oh, the lies y'all sold us, um
This poor love of ours, this gospel we sing
This little shine of mine, I'm gonna let it eat me up, I'm gonna let it kill me
Gonna let it fuck me up till I'm leanin', 'till I'm fiendin', till I'm feelin' better, wow
I kinda feel better now
'Cause I got it now
For me
For him
For her
For my Grandmama who had to pick cotton
And my Granddaddy who got lashed at then laughed at
Who you turned your back on, who you took your turn on for masa
I'm sorry, I'm kinda violent now
Fuckin' tired now
Don't mean to disturb your peace, just needed a little piece of what you got from NASA
Y'all got me hot now
Not asking for permission, came back to see what's good now
Niggas buyin' dreams by the pound, only real niggas sellin'
Only real niggas feel your fear
It's nice I frighten you
It's nice I've inspired you
To look, to think, to act like me
Little, old me?
Little, old me came back to say
We made it
