Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was the case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
Sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love


Gun to your back 'cause you black kids in the whip
Seven to his back different than when we ride for Kaepernick
At seventeen, a son dies, murder was the case
Time flies still we never can forget the face
It's mourning nights knowin' Breonna ain't gettin' another morning
Watchin' black death, our murder shouldn't be normal
Mercy mercy what a world our black children are born into
Black is king we pray that scars will heal, still a noose
Wounds out the womb, targets on our back like birth marks are tombs
And now these all black for the funerals
Following families at the funeral
Carried by six but we loved by the universe
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained street bodies glitter and gold
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained street bodies glitter and gold, kings


Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was the case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
The sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love


Pray for me, death in these streets
Red blood, these slugs, murder police
I know you fear my black is king
Please hug my momma tell her she's my queen
And the  should I not come home
Tell my daddy I held my own
Intimidated by my black my throne
They pulled that chrome under the black domes (bow)
Wounds out the womb, targets on our back like birth marks are tombs
And now these all black for the funerals
Following families at the funeral
Carried by six but we loved by the universe
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained streets bodies glitter and gold
Mercy mercy God shine through my soul
Bloodstained streets bodies glitter and gold, kings


Pray for me defend these streets
Murder was a case shot by police
Last word he said was I can't breathe
Rest in peace can rest in peace
Momma she gon' cry for me
Folks gon' yell, deep in these streets
Sound of pain, ain't no peace
Just know when you hear my people weep
It's the sound of love
It's the sound of love
It's the sound of love
