I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay (talk that talk)
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning (yeah)
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

Turned a quarter to a quarter milly
Went from dark days in the black
I ain't Lauryn Hill but still the path I took was hella Hilly
A queen within her palace
Every stone you threw look what it built me
This for every baller that they court I hope you look to
Billie Jean King
My gloves swing I made em see stars and thrillers
Laila Ali
Ran the track like Flo Jo nail me to the crosses
X Games
Kelly Clark's
Pipe down
Made em do it
Arenas scream Serena
This like Jesus music

Never seen nobody body like she bodied
Wit that body, Jesus Christ
Counting all the crosses
Diana Taurasi hella nice
Veins filled wit hella ice
So why I need the jewelry
I put a spin on everything
I'm Krista Yamaguchi

I turned dust into diamonds
And turned diamonds
Just Like Dot
I'm (richer son) but not enough
They still sock her price
And never foot the bill though we've defeated that
Twice
Times twice
4 on Abbey road
This is what it field like
Soccer

I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

Gimme my bread and
Put the ham on
Hammon, this ain't a Spur
Of the moment
I get my Hamm on
M-I-A
Jam on
A Heat check
Like Allison Fe-lex
Gimme respect
Screaming we next
Osaka Naomi
The pressure was on me
I made diamonds
Outta Roc checks
A bar flex
CunningHam
My cunning ham
I waited
Remember all the roads that they gated
I skated
You should join her
Like Jackie do
Whatever occur, see it through
And up the checks

Asked for equally pay
And they dug less
Douglas Gabby Simone
Only ones we respect on floors
Their routines ain't like yours
We ride waves
They used oars
Stick and stones don't break bones
Diamonds coming out my pores
We ain't pour

We complex
Like diamonds
We got necks
These bodies ain't just objects
I object
Can't judge me
I hold court like
Sue Bird
So whoever needed the jury
Made diamonds outta two words
Don't die man
Just get yours

Be careful of those stones you're throwing
That's what keeps me going
Going I

I
I keep on turning dust to diamonds
I'll make sure that this rust keeps shining
No matter the price I pay
And I
I'll get back up and keep on fighting
I'll be the one to ride the lightning
Through all the pressure and the pain
I turn dust to diamonds

I turn dust to diamonds
