Hey you
Where you been hanging out lately?
(You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feeling the love, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are

I just want to go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just want to sing loud
I just want to lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Burn in his arms tonight

Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Living a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around

Hey you

(You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger
Feeling the love, a teenager
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are, yeah
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are

I just want to go wild
I just wanna do some shit just to try
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just want to sing loud
I just want to lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Live in a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
I've missed you around
Missed you around
