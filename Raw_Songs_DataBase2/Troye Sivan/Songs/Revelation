You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know

It's a revelation
There's no hell in what I found
No kingdom shell
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

'Til the end
It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
