In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin, yeah

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
These bright lights, see these bright lights bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh yeah

Oh, all the glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, and dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin baby

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh, oh, I see again
