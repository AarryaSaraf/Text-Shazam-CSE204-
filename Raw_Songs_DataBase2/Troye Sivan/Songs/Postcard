I sent you a postcard from Tokyo baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck

'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

I remember that night when you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck

Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

Take your time
Pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers you doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
