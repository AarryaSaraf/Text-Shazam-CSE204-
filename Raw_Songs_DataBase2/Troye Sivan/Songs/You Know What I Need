When we only cared about the fall
It was the way to know that we were getting out
Too early to stay worried about us all
Before we knew what we were both about

And now w'ere stuck and holding
Everything is frozen
We're fake and safe and sound
And when I can't keep picking up each time you call
If everything I say just isn't sound

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

I'm learning, baby, if we keep on burning
No, I can't leave you, the world will keep on turning
But I'm thinking lately what's so concerning
Soon as I leave you, I just keep on hurting

And once we're off the tracks
It falls apart too fast
And we've been scared for too long
Never really lasts
Once I get to thinking, it all keeps coming back, yeah

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

Alright, baby, let's not lie, you know you don't cry for me
Why not?
Cryin' out in the dead of night, baby don't you lie to me
My god
Alright, baby, let's not lie, you know you don't die for me
Be honest, just try to be honest
Because

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it (I don't want it)
You're all that I want (You're all that I want)
You're all that I need (You're all that I need)
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

Before we run out of time, we gotta get it tonight
Before we leave it behind, we gotta get it alright
It's then after the party that we say our goodbyes
Got my hands on your body and it's feeling alright
But I don't want it
