I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it
I still see you way up here, yeah

I'm stressed about it
Went West about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
The way you run it
I still hear you crystal clear

But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now, ooh
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit (Hide my shit)
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give (I can give)
I don't wanna let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
