Got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working

I thought our love was strong and true
Until I read your note who made me so blue
And now dark clouds form all over my head
It looks like rain, it's rainin' above

I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
I got to keep on searchin'
Until I find you
Explain it to you

Really lost this time, a love so true
And memories of how it was, it makes me so blue
And now dark clouds all begin to cry
It looks like rain, it's raining from my eyes

I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
I got to keep on searchin'
Until I find you
Explain it to you
I got to keep on
I got to keep on searchin'
Such a low-down feeling
It keeps me from working
