Here we go, mm

Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch
The band is playing Dixie, a man's got his hand outstretched
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, he's got the sweet gift of gab, got a harmonious tongue
Knows every song of love that's ever been sung
Good intentions can be evil (Mhm), both hands can be full of grease, yeah (Yeah)
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, well first he's in the background (Yeah), then he's in the front
Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabid hunt
Nobody can see through him (Yeah), not even the chief of police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man, a man of peace, mm, hey

Watch your step
Watch your step
You better watch your step
Watch your step, watch your step
Sometimes Satan, comes as a man of peace, yeah, yeah

Well he'll catch you when you're hopin' for a glimpse of the sun (Yeah)
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
Could be standing next to you (Mhm)
The person that you notice least (Never notice)
Well, I hear that that sometimes Satan comes as a man, a man of peace

Well he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Somewhere mama's weepin' for her blue-eyed boy
And she's holding those little white shoes in that little broken toy
And she's following a star, yeah, the same one them three man followed from the east
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace (A man of peace)

You know that, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace (Yeah, yeah)
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man, a man of peace
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
