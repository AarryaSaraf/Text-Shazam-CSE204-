(Check it out, check it out, this love affair)
(Check it out, check it out, this love affair)

One - it's on the money, two - it's in full stride
Three - we've got each other, so there's no need to hide
Honey, this love affair has gotten to where I want it
This love affair, I'm so proud to own it
Oh this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
Four -  we're getting over, five -  we've got it made
Six, let's pray forever, this love will never fade
'Cause it's a miracle there ain't no doubt about it
This love affair, I've got to talk about it
Oh this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
For the first time in my life I can see clear the skies
So let's soar them like two eagles and fly so high
Seven - bound for heaven, eight - we're at the gate
Nine - we've got their blessings, ten - we're perfect mates
Honey, this love affair has gotten me where I want it
This love affair, I'm so proud to own it
Yeah yeah 

Yeah yeah...

This love affair, Oh oh
Seven - bound for heaven, oh well eight - we're at the gate
Nine - we've got their blessings, ten - we're perfect mates
Honey this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
Woah this love affair
This love affair...
