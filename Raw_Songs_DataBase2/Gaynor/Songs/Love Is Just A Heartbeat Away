Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm craving all the things I can say

I'm in love with you
You're inside my soul
And when I'm with you
I just lose control
Whatever I am
Wherever I go
Stay with me

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm waiting for a man who will stay

I'm in love with you
Now turn on my dream
Please, be real
Let's keep love our theme
You're what I want
You're what I need
I love you

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today

Now my love is here
No more nights alone
'Cause I know you're real
From the love you've shown
Faithful and true
My special affair
I'm in love with you

Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just
Love is just, love is just

Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today (baby)
Love is just a heartbeat away
I feel it's gonna happen today
Love is just a heartbeat away
I'm waiting for a man who will stay
