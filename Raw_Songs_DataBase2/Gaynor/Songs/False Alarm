Hey diddle diddle, I'm in the middle
I thought you ran away with my heart
Oh, Mother Mary is quite the contrarian
The fire never really got a chance to start
Now you might think I'm crazy
To say these things so fast
Thought I'd fallen in love again
And long it won't go and last
But it was only a...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Knew I'd lose you, I suppose
But you're still the one I chose

I get excited when love's invited
To play another game with my heart
Think nothin' of it, you know I love it
Cause we'll have a lot of fun before we have to part
Now you may think I'm crazy
To speak of love like this
But if you find a guy so sweet
With looks as good as his
You'd rush right into a...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
From the start I shoulda known
You would never be my own
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run

Made me think you were the one
But in the end I knew you'd run

I must confess, this has happened to me before
Falling in love with new and old friends
In fact, it's happened about 50 times!
There's another pretty face
And well, there I go, off to another...

False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
Knew I'd lose you, I suppose
But you're still the one I chose
False alarm, false alarm
All wrapped up in your lovin' charm
A pretty face sent my head into space
