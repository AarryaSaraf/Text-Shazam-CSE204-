Sometimes you say you love me
Sometimes you say you need me, baby
But then you're always leaving me
I need your love, not just sympathy

I know you don't really care
But then you always swear
That you and I were meant to be
Oh, you tell me

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

So many times I tried
To bring you closer to me, baby
I tried to make you see
How happy you and I can be

I know I'm wasting my time
But you keep giving me that same old line
That you and I were meant to be
Oh, you tell me

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever

We belong together
We can make it better and better
We belong together
Oh, forever and ever and ever
