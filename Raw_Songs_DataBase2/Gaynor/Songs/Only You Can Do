I've had my fortune, had my share of fame
Been around the world, I guess I've played the game
Put my attention into everything but You, mm-mm
It's taken me this long to understand
It's taken being broken time and again
To realize that all I really need is You, only You

When all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart and You won't let go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
Like only You can do, Jesus

Every time I try to do it all alone
Every time I try to make it on my own
That's when I realize no matter what I try to do
I still need You

And when all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart, You won't let me go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
Like only You can do, Jesus

Only You can turn my night into day
Break through the prison walls and rescue me
No one else can change a heart the way You do
Only You, yes You

When all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart, You won't let me go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do, ooh, oh
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do, ooh, yeah
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You can turn my night into day
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You, only You can take the pain away
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do
(Only You can do, only You can do)
(Only You can do, only You can do)
