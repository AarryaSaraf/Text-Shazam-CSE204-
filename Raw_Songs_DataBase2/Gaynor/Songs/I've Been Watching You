When the rose slaps your face
Says your pain is a state of grace
(I think that's right)
Mirror cracks, image bleeds
He'll touch your desires but not your needs

I stand at an open window, I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

Party ends on the floor
Hear a voice behind the door
In the dark, you play his games
Forget yourself, forget your name

I stand at an open window, I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

So there you are, all dressed in black
Walk away and don't look back
But if you must, then cast a stone
The light is on but there's nothing and no one home
(I think)

'Cause I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

I said, I, I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you down
