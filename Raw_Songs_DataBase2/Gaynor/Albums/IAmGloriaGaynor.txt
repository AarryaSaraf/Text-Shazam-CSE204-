// I Am What I Am //

I am what I am
I am my own special creation
So come take a look
Give me the hook or the ovation

It's my world that I want to have a little pride in
My world and it's not a place I have to hide in
Life's not worth a damn
'Til you can say I am what I am

I am what I am
I don't want praise, I don't want pity
I bang my own drum
Some think it's noise, I think it's pretty

And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle
Why not try to see things from a different angle
Your life is a sham
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am

I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the ace, sometimes the deuces

It's one life and there's no return and no deposit
One life. So it's time to open up your closet
Life's not worth a damn
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am

I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck
Sometimes the ace, sometimes the deuces

It's one life and there's no return and no deposit
One life. So it's time to open up your closet
Life's not worth a damn
'Til you can shout out, I am what I am

// I've Been Watching You //

When the rose slaps your face
Says your pain is a state of grace
(I think that's right)
Mirror cracks, image bleeds
He'll touch your desires but not your needs

I stand at an open window, I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

Party ends on the floor
Hear a voice behind the door
In the dark, you play his games
Forget yourself, forget your name

I stand at an open window, I see everything there is to see
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

So there you are, all dressed in black
Walk away and don't look back
But if you must, then cast a stone
The light is on but there's nothing and no one home
(I think)

'Cause I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you?

I said, I, I've been watching you
Isn't it true, the fool keeps taking you down, down, taking you?
I've been watching you
Isn't true, the world keeps taking you down, down, taking you down

// More Than Enough //

My God is more than enough
He can supply all my needs
He is my El Shaddai
He always looks out for me
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
All of the earth is his
And the fullness there of
He's everything that I need
You can be sure of
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
So why should I worry bout the highs and the lows
The ups and the downs
And by my faith I know
My God is more than enough 
He can supply all my needs 
He is my El Shaddai
He always looks out for me
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
Jehovha Jirah He is my god
