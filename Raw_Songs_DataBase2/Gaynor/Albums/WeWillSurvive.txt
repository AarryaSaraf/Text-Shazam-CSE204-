Album: WeWillSurvive

// I Will Survive //

At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
And now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

Go on now, go. Walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
I will survive

// You're Right On Time //

[Verse 1:]
I've been down
Without a prayer
I've been broken
Oh gave up hoping
yet I've been there

[Pre-chorus 1:]
Sometimes it takes a sunset
To remind we're alive
Or just the smallest thing that's living
Reminds us we will survive

[Chorus:]
No matter how hard
No matter how dark
No matter how long the road to hill
no matter how weak
No matter how lost
You've just got to know you're being late
You're just where you need to be
Not early on legacy
You're right on time

[Verse 2:]
I've been hurt
I've been pushed around
I've been cheated
I've been mistreated
I've been let down

[Pre-chorus 2:]
When I decided to stop running
And let the future come to me
I only had to let the sun in
So that the truth could set me free

[Chorus]

Your mistakes are for a reason
Everybody has a season
You're right on time
