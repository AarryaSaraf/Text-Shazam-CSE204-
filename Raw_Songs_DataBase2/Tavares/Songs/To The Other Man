Hey Mama, hey Mama

Mama used to take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
I didn't know at the time
Being bad could lead to crime
But now I'm glad

Well, she kept me on the double
I stayed out of trouble
Now I understand
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"

When I used to make fun of others
She'd say, "No not to your brothers"
And that ain't all (that ain't all)
"When someone is feeling low
Think of the nicest things you know
To make them feel tall"

I'll never forget what Mama said
When she kneeled down and prayed
For my father's guiding hand
"Throw your arms around his neck
Make him proud to give respect
To the other man"

Whoa, now that I'm a man (now that I'm a man)
God has taken my mother's hand (God has taken my mother's hand)
And now-ow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow, I'll carry on
Oh, sometimes I'll have to weep
Mother's love I'll always keep
'Cause she made me strong

And if I should ever have a son (if I should ever have a son)
We're gonna have lots of fun (we're gonna have lots of fun)
And I'll teach him up to understand
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect" (and I know, I know, I know what my mother would tell me)
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect now)
Promise you'll always give respect" (and I know, I know, I know what my mother would tell me)
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"
