It's an uptight world out there
And only the strong survive
You can get burned just like that
The minute you turn your back
But I can play the game
When that's what I have to do
I know just what to say, I got a real smooth style
I got a winning smile

But when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself), oh, that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side
I can lay back, I can just relax
'Cause I know I'm safe with you
I can close my eyes with your hand in mine
On a slow train to paradise, yeah

But when I'm back on the street
Oh, it begins all over again (All over again)
People bar their windows and lock their souls
Everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
And I'm just like them
I'm out there to win
But it's so good to know when I get home
The madness will always end

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side
I can lay back, I can just relax
'Cause I know I'm safe with you
I can close my eyes with your hand in mine
On a slow train (Slow train to paradise)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side (Slow train to paradise)
When I'm with you, you, you, you (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train, yeah (Slow train to paradise)
Slow train to paradise (Be myself)
I can be myself (Slow train to paradise)
Yeah, hey

I'm with you
Slow train to paradise
I'm with you
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
I'm on a slow train (Slow train to paradise)
Slow train, slow train

(I'm with you) Yeah
(Slow train to paradise) Woo-woo-woo
(Be myself) It might take, it might take a week, baby
(Slow train to paradise) But I'm gonna get there
(I'm with you) Oh mama, oh mama
(Slow train to paradise) Oh mama, with you, hey, baby
(Be myself) It might take forever
(Slow train to paradise) But I'm gonna find you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
