You look as though you model
For New England's Bricks and Tartans
Fashion'ble
The twinkle in your eye
Is so sincere
It's such a joy
Just to have you near, sweetheart

And I can tell by the look on your face
I'm in love

I don't need a sorcerer's book
To let me know you've got me hooked
It's plain to see
The simple way we found
When things are right
You run into my arms
And say, "Hold me tight, my love"

And I can tell by the look on your face, girl
I'm in love

Hey heaven
Oh sweet, my love
You know I'm in love
Can't you see I'm in love
Oh yes, I'm in love

Can't you see
You know I'm falling in love

I give you all I have, baby

Hey sweet, my love
Oh baby
You know I'm in love
Can't you see I'm in love
You know I'm falling in love

Can't you see
