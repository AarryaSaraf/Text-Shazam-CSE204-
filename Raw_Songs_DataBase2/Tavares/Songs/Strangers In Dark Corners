Strangers in dark corners
True love in disguise
I can't help myself, Lord, I want her
I'm doing things against my pride

But love has come again
To what was a lonely man
Should I
Just forget the joy for which she holds
Ignore my heart, let my mind take control, and lie

Alone, we're just strangers in dark corners
Two hearts on a lover's heart
Four eyes staring at each other
Desperately searching inside

Looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just strangers, Lord, in dark corners

In love, looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just two strangers in dark corners
Two hearts beating fast
We're just strangers in dark corners
Trying to make every minute last

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just two strangers
Oh, in dark corners, yeah
