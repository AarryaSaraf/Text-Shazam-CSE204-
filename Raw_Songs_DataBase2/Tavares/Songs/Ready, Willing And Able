Yes, I am ready, willing and able
Yes, I am ready, willing and able

Oh, I know what goes on
In the mind of a lonely girl
Well, I've seen how you have been treated
It's a cold and ruthless world
Your dreams have all been broken in two
I can put them back together, together with you

Ready, willing and able
Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Baby, can't you see
That I am ready, willing and able to love you girl

You've been cheated
You've been tied too
Girl with your pain I can see the signs
Everybody who knows the feeling
It don't come as a big surprise
Your tears there no different than mine
So come on hold on all we need
Is just a some more time

Ready, willing and able
Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Baby, can't you see
That I am ready, willing and able to love you girl

Ready, willing and able
Ready, willing and able

It's a very cold and ruthless world
For such a lonely, lonely girl
I know you have been cheated mistreated
For such a long, long time
So here I am, I am prepared to show you
Where you it ain't all the same
So I am ready, willing and able girl to me

Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Ready, willing and able
