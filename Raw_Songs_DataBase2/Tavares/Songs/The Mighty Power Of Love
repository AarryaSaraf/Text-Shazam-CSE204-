The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
Love can open any door
Stand alone on any floor
If you're in love
Why don't you check it out

The mighty power of love
Grows sweeter than the flower's bud
Love can break through shields of anger
Make a friend out of a stranger
Can't say enough
Love can do so much
Love can make a winter's day
Seem like the Fourth of July
Oh, love can make a lover's dream
Come true before his eyes

Oh whoa (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (ah)

The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
It's your lifeboat to the shore
Your umbrella when it pours
Can't say enough
Love can do so much

Mighty power
Power of love, yeah
Mighty power
Power of love, yeah

Ooh, love can give the beggar courage
Courage to face up to kings
Oh, love can make the rich man's clothes
Love can do many things

Oh whoa (oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (ah)

The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
It's your ladder to the top
It's your net when you've been dropped
Can't say enough
Love can do so much

The mighty power of love (the mighty power of love)
Can't say enough, love can do so much
The mighty power of love
If you're in love, why don't you check it out

Mighty power (mighty, mighty power)
Power of love, yeah (get down with the power)
Mighty power (mighty, mighty power)
Power of love, yeah (get down with the groove, y'all)
Mighty power (it's got more push than shove, yeah)
Power of love, yeah (talkin' about love when love is lost)
Mighty power (your lifeboat to the shore, yeah)
Power of love, yeah (the mighty, mighty, mighty power)
Mighty power (got to have love, yeah-yeah)
Power of love, yeah (gonna sing this song love, hey-hey)
Mighty power (ooh-hoo, gonna sing a song, y'all)
Power of love, yeah (hey, hey, hey, hey, gonna shake it off)
Mighty power (gonna shake it off, gotta shake it off)
Power of love, yeah (ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo, hey, hey, hey)
