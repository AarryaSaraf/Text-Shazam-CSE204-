Took a look at you
That's all I had to do
And you just took my breath away
I knew I'd never be the same

And when you touched my hand
I went to wonderland
I never dreamed that there could be
The kind of love you made with me last night

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't we go to paradise
Last night?

Take a look at me
Tell me what you see (Tell me what you see)
Are there any clouds around?
Or are my feet still on the ground?

Girl, I love you so
I swear I just don't know
How I still could be alive
I can't believe I could survive last night

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light, yeah
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two? Yeah
Didn't we go to paradise
Last night?

Yeah, didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't we go to paradise?
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two? Yeah
Didn't we go to paradise?

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two?

Didn't we go to paradise last night?
Hard to believe I see the morning light
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Didn't I get to Heaven loving you?
Didn't we find a Shangri-La for two?
