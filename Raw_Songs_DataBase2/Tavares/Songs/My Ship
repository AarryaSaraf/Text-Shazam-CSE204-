My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow
No

Well I got myself a steady job
And I've earned everybody's respect
Moving up higher up
There's a beauty that I got to protect

I've been saving every penny I can (that I can)
And I'm working a promise  (yes I am)
But I won't be complete
Til I'm reaching for a feminine hand
I keep on trying to tell you girl

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

I got everything I need but you
What's a man in my position to do?
Got a hold that was built
And designed for occupation for two
Brand new

I can listen to my CD you know
I can drive my car where I want to go
A material thing can be bought if you got money to blow
But money won't be devotion

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

Getting much closer to
The man I want to be (can't you see I'm changing)
But all this money see
Is only making me sad and lonely (so sad, so sad and lonely)

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow
No

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow

My my my my ship
Is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My my my my ship
Is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow
