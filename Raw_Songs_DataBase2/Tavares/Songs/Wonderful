Wonderful
To me that's what you are
Wonderful
Ooh, we'll never, never part

I never had a dream come true
Until the day I laid my eyes on you

The way you took control (yeah, baby)
Of my very soul (yeah, baby)
When you gave you love to me
I knew you had to be

Wonderful (ooh)
To me that's what you are (so wonderful, so wonderful)
Wonderful (ooh)
Ooh, we'll never, never part (never, never part)

I love you more as the days go by
And I'll be loving you, ooh, till the day I die

You know you're in command (yeah, baby)
Of my every plan (yeah, baby)
Don't you understand
My heart is in your hand

Wonderful (ooh, you're so wonderful)
To me that's what you are (aw, there's what you are to me, baby)
Wonderful (oh)
Ooh, we'll never, never part (never, never part)

Wonderful (ooh)
To me that's what you are (you're so wonderful to me)
Wonderful (oh)
Ooh, we'll never, never part

Wonderful (ooh)
To me that's what you are (ooh, wonderful, wonderful)
Wonderful (ah)
Ooh, we'll never, never part

Wonderful
