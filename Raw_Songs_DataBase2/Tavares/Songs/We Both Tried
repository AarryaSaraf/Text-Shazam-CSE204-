What can you do
When love decides to pass you by?
The more we try
The less we get along

There comes a time
In every life
When right or wrong
Is what comes between us
We've seen us fall apart
Down to the seams
Dreams

We both tried
Then love died
Old standbys
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye

Our love reminded me
Of wishing on a star
It was hard to feel anything
(We're both in love)
We put us through the paces
With total disregard
For the love between us
Refused to grow
Refused to spread her wings
Dreams, whoa

We both tried
We tried, we tried, we tried
Then love died
Ooh, no matter how we tried
Old standbys
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye, yeah yeah

We both lied
To ourselves about each other
We both cried
'Cause we needed something better
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries
So goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, goodbye

Ooh, we both tried
Everything, everything within our power
Then love died
Ooh, by the minute, by the hour
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries (They were such nice tries)
So goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, baby (Goodbye, goodbye)

Oh, we both tried, we both tried, baby
We both lied
And we cried, we cried, we cried, we cried
Old standbys (They were nothin' but standbys)
Were nice tries (Ooh, they tried)
But goodbye (Goodbye)
Goodbye, baby (Goodbye)
Goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Baby

We tried
Then love died
Ooh, we tried so hard, no matter how we tried
Old standbys (Old standbys)
Were nice tries
