I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

When your tomorrow seems uphill
When plans go wrong and leave you standing still
When you just cry and cry against your will
I'll sing a lullaby to make you smile
To brighten up your life

I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

I'll love you till the desert has no sand
Until the mighty sea covers all the land
Until my body turns to dust again
With every breath I take, step I make
I'll make sure you feel secure

I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

(I'll be your guiding star) Your guiding star
(My darling cross my heart) Cross my heart
(I'll never leave you in the dark) I'll never leave you, baby
(Oh-oh, and I'll be your light) I'll be your light
(At the top of the stairs)
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

Yes, my darling, I'll be your shepherd
And you'll be my precious lamb
You can feel protected, I know you can
I love you so much
And baby, I'll keep you in my heart
Wherever I am, wherever I am

(I'll be your guiding star) Your guiding star
(My darling cross my heart) Cross my heart
(I'll never leave you in the dark) I'll never leave you, baby
(Oh-oh, and I'll be your light) I'll be your light
(At the top of the stairs)
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers
