Here we are together, you and I
Feeling like I always knew we could
Seems as though my heart just touched the sky
Never knew that we could feel this good

The joy of you and me
I'm hoping that you'll see
Just reach out to me

Why can't we fall in love? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
(Strength inside of you)
Can't you feel it too? (Can't you feel it too?)
Don't be afraid to let your love come through

Few of us will ever see the moon
Or even stop to hear our own love songs
Before you know it's over all too soon
I hope that's not the way we move along

Playing foolish games
When no one wins the prize
It's right here in our eyes

Why can't we fall in love? Yeah (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside of you
(Strength inside of you)
Can't you feel it too? (Can't you feel it too?)
Don't be afraid to let your love come through
Hey baby

Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Girl, I need you so (Why don't we fall in love?)
In a world that's rushing by
And when love is seldom true
I know that I can find some strength inside you
(Strength inside of you)

Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why, why can't we fall in love? (Why don't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why don't we fall in love?)
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)

Why don't we fall in love?
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
Why don't we fall in love?
Why can't we fall? (Why can't we fall in love?)
