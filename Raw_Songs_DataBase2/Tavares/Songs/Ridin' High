Going up, mm
Going up, you and me, girl
Going up, c'mon

Living it up and loving it
Ooh, feels so good, we're together
Getting up close, mm, and gettin' down
We've been like a hand and glove
Up here on the wings of love

Hey, we're ridin' high
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Like the sun up in the sky)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Dancing on the stars as we go by)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

Shoo-doop, shoo-doop
Shoo-doop, shoo-doop

Elevating, that's what your kisses are
Whenever you're near me, I see shooting stars
Body and soul locked in blissful unity
I'll stay yours if you stay mine
We won't ever have to leave cloud nine

Hey, we're ridin' high (going up)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(You're my beautiful butterfly)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(I'm your eagle on the wing, keeping a watch for love)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

We're gonna feel this mellow mood
Don't stop now (hey)
Just getting good (just gettin' good)
(Just getting good)

Hey, we're ridin' high (hey, we're ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Like the sun up in the sky)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (oh, baby)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Dancing on the stars as we go by)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ooh)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(You're my beautiful butterfly)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (baby, baby)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(I'm your eagle on the wing, keeping a watch for love)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high
Hey-hey, we're ridin' high
Hey-hey-hey, we're ridin' high
Hey-hey-hey-hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (going up)
Hey, we're ridin' high (hang on, baby)
(I'm your eagle on the wing, girl, keeping a watch for love)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ooh)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high
Hey, we're ridin' high
