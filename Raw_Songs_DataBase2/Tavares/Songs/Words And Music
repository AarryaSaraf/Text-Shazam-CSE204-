My darlin'
You know that I depend upon your very smile
And my day would not begin
Without your precious kiss
And if someone wrote my story
And tried to leave you out, huh
The most important part they'd surely miss

(Do you understand) I'm nothing without you
Girl, you're my heart, you're my soul
You're my life, it's true

You are the words
You are the music
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words
You are the music
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

No, I can't count the ways
You've brought me happiness
You've shown me what no other love has shown

(And, oh) If I live forever
If I live a million years
This heart will still want you and you alone

(Never, ever doubt) You are the only one
Girl, you're my world, you're my dreams
You're my morning sun

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

(Yes, it's true)
I'll dedicate each passing day to you
Now and forever more
Your love is what I'm living for
(Don't you understand) I'm holding out
I'm holding out my hand to you

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
You are the music (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed

You are the words (You are the words)
Girl, you're my music  (You are the music)
You're the song that plays over and over
Again in my head

You are the words (You are the words)
Girl, you are my music  (You are the music)
You're the tune that I dream of
And sing every morning in bed
