Hey girl, y'know what?
You and I have just been elected to the Hall of Fame
Uh uh mama, not that Hall of Fame
The Fool's Hall of Fame

Last night, I could hardly sleep
After all the foolish things that we said
I had the strangest dream
And I still can't get it out of my head

We were there (we were there)
When they called up the row for the Fool's Hall of Fame
(Fool's Hall of Fame)
Up the stairs (up the stairs)
All the couples were goin, they called up their names
(Called up their names)
When they got to the last two in line
What a shock, they were yours and mine

And I dreamed that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes, It seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame

We went in through the closing doors
And as soon as they had locked us inside
They showed us pools of tears
Under statues made of unyielding pride

We were there (we were there)
On a tragical tour of the Fool's Hall of Fame (Fool's Hall of Fame)
Everywhere (everywhere) were the pitiful pictures of planks with their names (planks with their names)
At the end came the saddest part
They presented us with broken hearts

And I dreamed that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes it seems, they have added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame

I woke (I woke right up) grab the telephone
I'll try to call, but you were not at home (not at home)
So when I heard you're not, somehow I knew
You came to tell me you are dreaming too

Oh, we dream that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes, it seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Oh, we dreamed that they added our names
(They added our names to the Fool's Hall of Fame)
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
It seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
(Oh, I'm so glad, I'm so glad that it was only a dream)
Dream that they added our names
(So good, so good that the dream...)
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
