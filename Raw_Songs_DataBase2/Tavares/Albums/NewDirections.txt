// A Penny For Your Thoughts //

(Penny for your thoughts)

I've got to know where I stand
I just got to know where I am with you

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Walking, holding hands, you say you're mine, all mine
Then soon another face steals your eyes away
It's just a guessing game, and I can't help feeling used
Love shouldn't be so darn confused

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

People love to talk, they say you're using me
Though face to face you swear I'm the only one
If I had a crystal ball, I would gaze into your mind
I'd see what you were thinking, if our ship was sinking
If you're leaving me behind

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

Girl, if I had a crystal ball (a crystal ball)
I would gaze into your mind
I'd see what you were thinking
If our ship was sinking
If you're leaving me behind

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

So here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (hey, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me (tell me you love me)
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (Ooh, your thoughts, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss (Ooh, a kiss, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts {Only me, only me}, a nickel for a kiss
(Just me) {Yeah, yeah, yeah} (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Penny for your thoughts (Just your thoughts), a nickel for a kiss (And a kiss, baby)
A dime if you tell me that you love me (Tell me you love me)
Penny for your thoughts {Only me}, a nickel for a kiss {Darling, can't you see}
(Oh, yeah) {Yeah, yeah} (Yeah, yeah)

Penny for your thoughts (Ooh, baby), a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

// Abra-Ca-Dabra Love You Too //

Magic, I've got magic everyday that I'm alive
Something special since you've come to me girl

Teardrops, no more teardrops
That's a thing of the past
It's a mixed-up and a mystical world

All it took was just one wave of your hand
You changed my life with just one kiss

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
Abracadabra, love you too

Stardust, I see stardust when I look in your eyes
So much sweetness in those ruby lips

Power, you've got power, get me under your spell
You've got heaven in your fingertips

Love this happiness waving down from above
You filled me with your precious love

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
Abracadabra, love you too

It's impossible to measure all the love
Oh how I treasure what you are, you're my lucky star

I want to know whoever sent you
Someone out there must have met you

Give me a dream
Heaven knows I love you so
And I can't let go

Like a genie in a bottle you appear
Right out of the blue
Abracadabra, love you too
