// It Only Takes A Minute //

Ah, ha
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha, yeah

Once an hour of the day
We threw at least fun away
Walk the streets half a year
Tryin' to find a new career

Now if you get a flu attack
For 30 days you're on your back
Through the night I've seen you dance
Baby, give me half a chance

It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life readin' signs
Waitin' for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you, yeah

Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
(Haven't accomplished a thing)
So baby, leave a little time
'Cause you never know what's on my mind, yeah

It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl, yeah
To fall in love, let's fall in love

Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love

It only takes a minute, girl
Baby, to fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love

It only takes a minute, girl
Baby, to fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love

// Fool's Hall Of Fame //

Hey girl, y'know what?
You and I have just been elected to the Hall of Fame
Uh uh mama, not that Hall of Fame
The Fool's Hall of Fame

Last night, I could hardly sleep
After all the foolish things that we said
I had the strangest dream
And I still can't get it out of my head

We were there (we were there)
When they called up the row for the Fool's Hall of Fame
(Fool's Hall of Fame)
Up the stairs (up the stairs)
All the couples were goin, they called up their names
(Called up their names)
When they got to the last two in line
What a shock, they were yours and mine

And I dreamed that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes, It seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame

We went in through the closing doors
And as soon as they had locked us inside
They showed us pools of tears
Under statues made of unyielding pride

We were there (we were there)
On a tragical tour of the Fool's Hall of Fame (Fool's Hall of Fame)
Everywhere (everywhere) were the pitiful pictures of planks with their names (planks with their names)
At the end came the saddest part
They presented us with broken hearts

And I dreamed that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes it seems, they have added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame

I woke (I woke right up) grab the telephone
I'll try to call, but you were not at home (not at home)
So when I heard you're not, somehow I knew
You came to tell me you are dreaming too

Oh, we dream that they added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Yes, it seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
Oh, we dreamed that they added our names
(They added our names to the Fool's Hall of Fame)
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
It seems they had added our names
To the Fool's Hall of Fame
(Oh, I'm so glad, I'm so glad that it was only a dream)
Dream that they added our names
(So good, so good that the dream...)
To the Fool's Hall of Fame

// The Love I Never Had //

Never gonna miss it
The love I never had.
Never gonna miss it
The love I never had.
Never gonna miss it...

You've been coming home a little later
And you never feel like saying where you've been.
You know I tried to make some conversation
But I guess the things I say are wearin' thin.
You never needed me, I only see it now
But I can live alone, girl you taught me how.
And I wish that I could say I'm gonna feel so sad
(Gonna feel so sad)
But I just can't miss the love I never had

Never gonna miss it
The love I never had.
Never gonna miss it...

When I was reachin' out you didn't want me
But at least I know I gave it one good try.
(Didn't I, didn't I give it one good try?)
Gonna pack my bags then I'll be leavin'
You don't have to stay around to say goodbye.
Oh any fool can see it's over and it's done.
It really ended girl, before it had begun.
And I wish that I could say I'm gonna take it bad
Oh so bad, so bad
But I just can't miss the love I never had

(Never gonna miss it)
Oh and I wish that I could say I'm gonna feel so sad, so sad
(Gonna feel so sad)
But I just can't miss the love I never had.

Never gonna miss it...
The love I never had

// Nothing You Can Do //

It's real, even though you're with me all the time
No matter where you are
No one can steal your love
You gotta realize they won't get far

I can't give you up
No, no, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hangin' tight
Come on and build me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin'
You got to set it up
Ain't no use in me running

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away
Nothing you can do could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me break away

You're mine
But I can't do a thing about it, no
It takes time to get there
And I just wanna sing about it, yeah

I can't give you up
No, no, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hangin' tight
Come on and build me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin', yeah
You got to set it up
Ain't no use in running

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away, yeah
Nothing you can do could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me break away, yeah

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you, baby
Nothing you can say could make me turn away, yeah
Nothing you can do (nothing you can do)
Could make me stop (nothing you can say, yeah) loving you, baby
I'm gonna love you, girl
You never make me turn away, yeah

Ooh, ooh ooh
I can't give you up
Can't give you up, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Ooh, ooh ooh
Don't wanna let it up, no, no
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

Ooh ooh ooh
Come on and build me up
Come on and build me up
No, no, no, no, no

// In The Eyes Of Love //

We don't own a brand new car
A big fine house
Saying who we are
Never dreamed of what might be
We make the most of reality

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far

There are times when Friday comes
And the bills are paid
There are no great songs
So we stay home wooping up some rhymes
Simple things just suit me fine

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far

Now baby we may not have
All the money in the world
But what we do have is
Something so special and rare

But in the eyes of love
No-one could be richer that we are
In the eyes of love
Baby we have been making it so far

// Ready, Willing And Able //

Yes, I am ready, willing and able
Yes, I am ready, willing and able

Oh, I know what goes on
In the mind of a lonely girl
Well, I've seen how you have been treated
It's a cold and ruthless world
Your dreams have all been broken in two
I can put them back together, together with you

Ready, willing and able
Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Baby, can't you see
That I am ready, willing and able to love you girl

You've been cheated
You've been tied too
Girl with your pain I can see the signs
Everybody who knows the feeling
It don't come as a big surprise
Your tears there no different than mine
So come on hold on all we need
Is just a some more time

Ready, willing and able
Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Baby, can't you see
That I am ready, willing and able to love you girl

Ready, willing and able
Ready, willing and able

It's a very cold and ruthless world
For such a lonely, lonely girl
I know you have been cheated mistreated
For such a long, long time
So here I am, I am prepared to show you
Where you it ain't all the same
So I am ready, willing and able girl to me

Let me be the one
Who changes re-arranges your whole life
Ready, willing and able

// We Fit To A Tee //

What cream is to coffee?
What honey is to a bee?
What maple is to syrup?
Is what you are good to me?

If divided they weak, together they strong
Two of a kind can never be wrong

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
We got together like a ship and the sea

What corn-bread means to black-eyed peas?
What chitlins mean to collard greens?
A perfect combination matches on a pair of jeans
Without the one the other don't shine
We even get a compatible sign

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
We got together like the leaves on the tree

What is the moon if there ain't no sun?
Baby, two hearts are better than one

Oh, we fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
Baby, we fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like a ship and the sea

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
We fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like the leaves on the tree

We fit to a tee, you and me
That is the way the whole world ought to be
We fit to a tee, yes-siree
We got together like a ship and the sea...

// Free Ride //

The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused bout which to go
So I came here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on, let's take a free ride

All over the country, I've seen it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers
Must come from within, so

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on and take a free ride

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ooh, ooh, free ride

Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
