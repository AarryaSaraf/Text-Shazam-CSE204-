// The Ghost Of Love //

The ghost of love keeps hauntin' me
Although you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love says, "peek-a-boo"
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright and all your days be blue

Ooh... ooh... ooh...

You went away, I met this girl
Night and day she shared my world
Just when I thought I had forgot
That loving spell you weave so well

Suddenly that look comes on my face
And I start starin' way out of space
I know why the girl stopped comin' round
The ghost of love has done run her out of town

The ghost of love keeps hauntin' me
Although you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love says, "peek-a-boo"
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright and all your days be blue

Ooh... ooh... ooh...

Your love has died, but mine won't rest
This feelin' for you is jumpin' in my chest
No one else can fill the bill
I'll wait for your return and pray that you will

Round about the midnight hour
I start to feel your lovin' power
Right away I'm tossin' in my sleep
Daybreak finds me wrapped up in my sheets

The ghost of love (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me {Is haunting me} (Haunting me)

Ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh...

The ghost of love (Ghost of love) keeps haunting me (Haunting me)
Although you're gone (Although you're gone), I can't get free (Can't get free)
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love (Ghost of love) says, "peek-a-boo"

The ghost of love (Ghost of love) keeps haunting me (Haunting me)
Although you're gone (Ghost of love), I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love (Ghost of love)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh (The ghost of love)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, woo (Keeps haunting me)
Ooh, woo

Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
And all your days be blue

The ghost of love (Ghost of love) (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Hauntin' me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me), oh...

Can't get no sleep, wrapped up in my sheets
Full of fright every night
That lovin' spell
You weave so well

Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
And all your days be blue

The ghost of love {Ghost of love} (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Is haunting me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me), hey...

The ghost of love is hauntin' me
Although you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think I'm over you
The ghost of love says, "peek-peek-a-boo"

Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

The ghost of love (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Haunting me) (Haunting me)

// Slow Train To Paradise //

It's an uptight world out there
And only the strong survive
You can get burned just like that
The minute you turn your back
But I can play the game
When that's what I have to do
I know just what to say, I got a real smooth style
I got a winning smile

But when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself), oh, that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side
I can lay back, I can just relax
'Cause I know I'm safe with you
I can close my eyes with your hand in mine
On a slow train to paradise, yeah

But when I'm back on the street
Oh, it begins all over again (All over again)
People bar their windows and lock their souls
Everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
And I'm just like them
I'm out there to win
But it's so good to know when I get home
The madness will always end

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side
I can lay back, I can just relax
'Cause I know I'm safe with you
I can close my eyes with your hand in mine
On a slow train (Slow train to paradise)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
'Cause I know you're on my side (Slow train to paradise)
When I'm with you, you, you, you (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train, yeah (Slow train to paradise)
Slow train to paradise (Be myself)
I can be myself (Slow train to paradise)
Yeah, hey

I'm with you
Slow train to paradise
I'm with you
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, all aboard
Slow train to paradise
Woo-woo, come on, get on board
Slow train to paradise

'Cause when I'm with you, I got nothing to prove (I'm with you)
I'm on a slow train to paradise
I can be myself (Be myself) and that's alright
I'm on a slow train (Slow train to paradise)
Slow train, slow train

(I'm with you) Yeah
(Slow train to paradise) Woo-woo-woo
(Be myself) It might take, it might take a week, baby
(Slow train to paradise) But I'm gonna get there
(I'm with you) Oh mama, oh mama
(Slow train to paradise) Oh mama, with you, hey, baby
(Be myself) It might take forever
(Slow train to paradise) But I'm gonna find you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

// More Than A Woman //

Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman
More than a woman to me, baby
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ahh

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time (Minute at a time)

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Yes you are, baby)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me
Shoo, doo doo
More than a woman, ahh

More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me, yeah
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (Every day of my life)
More than a woman (Ohh baby)
More than a woman to me, yeah (You are, you are, you are)
More than a woman (More than a woman)
More than a woman to me (She treats me good, like a love should)
More than a woman (Yeah)
More than a woman to me (Yeah baby)
