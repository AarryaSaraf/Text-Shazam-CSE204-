Album: Loveline

// Keep On //

This is a song about you, baby
You know you keep me on a high
Don't you know your lovin' drives me crazy?
But I don't know the reason why
Sweet imaginary lover
You turn me on with so much ease
And what you do is undercover
You know you got me in deep freeze
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time

You were so cool when I reacted
This mystery I can't explain
And I see a certain kind of magic
In everything you do and say
I just can't get enough of your loving
(You're the only one) Who spends the night
And I'll do my best to keep you happy
You give me love and I'm satisfied
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time

I just can't get enough of your loving
(You're the only one) Who spends the night
And I'll do my best to keep you happy
You give your love and I'm satisfied
So baby

Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on doing what you're doing
Sending chills down my spine
Keep on doing what you do
'Cause what you're doing, baby, I need it all the time
(Baby)
Keep on

// Turn Out The Nightlight //

Turn out the nightlight
Let's put on our song
Turn on your lovelight
And rock me all night long
Turn out the nightlight
Girl, I wanna make love to you

Turn out the nightlight
Say it's been a lonely day
Turn on your lovelight
No more fussin' and fightin' that way
I wanna make you feel right
I need you closer, and closer to me, oh, oh

So won't you please let me in
Let me in your heart again
We should always be the best of friends
Let's keep it together
It's so much better

Turn out the nightlight
Oh, you look so fine
Turn on your lovelight
And let's sip a little wine
Lovin' in the moonlight
Makes me want you over and over again

So won't you please let me in
Let me in your heart again
We should always be the best of friends
Let's keep it together
It's so much better, better, better

Uh huh
Uh huh

Oh, I need your love
It's been such a lonely, lonely day
Girl, you look so fine
I know you're mine
I want you over and over and over and over
Uh huh

Yeah, yeah
Turn out the nightlight
Love, turn
Uh huh
Ba, ba, ba, ba da, ba da
Girl, I wanna love you
I wanna make you feel right
Got to make you feel alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh huh
Ba ba ba ba da, ba da
Ooh, I wanna love you
Turn out the nightlight
Oh, let me reach over now
Let me reach over now, uh, uh, uh
Uh huh
