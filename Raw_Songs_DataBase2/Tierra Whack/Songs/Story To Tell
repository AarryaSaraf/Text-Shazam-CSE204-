Everybody's always askin'
How'd you get on We Run the Streets?
Think its 'bout time I tell y'all a little story (Little story)
Yo, yo

Look, I came home from school
I was on my way to sleep
Even kicked off my sneaks and put some Nas on repeat
Got a knock on my door, little sister yellin "Dizzle come on!"
I replied in the crack of a yawn
Then my mom stomped upstairs, looking all mean
She said if you wanna stay home, you gon have to clean
The bathroom, the dishes, and mop the whole kitchen
Said mom where we goin' to see how grandma is living?
I was too tired, and I ain't care to hear it
But my grandmas gettin' older and her death a really fear it
This whole time I was thinkin' too deep
I had this gut feelin' keep tellin' me to hop in the jeep (Beep beep)
I hear my mom honking the horn so I threw on some clothes and took off my uniform
I was chillin' in the car, push back my seat and all
Turn the radio up and started bobbin' my skull
All in the days, I was staring out the window
Thinkin' to myself like "When I'm gonna win yo?"
Rapping for a while but I just can't seem to make it
Second guessin' myself, I thought my skills had been wasted
But that wasn't the deal, that day I was depressed
I failed my Chemistry test, I'm talkin' straight F
Ridin through the city, no Philly to be specific
Rode past 18th & Oxford and dudes were spittin'
My mom said "Go rap, go on, just do it"
This could be your big break and it seemed like she knew it
Mother knows best so you know I got to it
I hopped out the ride and I was ready to influence
I did it, I killed it, but I was pretty nervous
Got a call that night and it was, it was pretty urgent
A guy named Ant, CEO We Run the Streets
He had filmed famous casts, like Cassidy and even me
I was shocked when he said he had posted up my video
Crazy feedback, I was the talk of the city yo!
One night, six thousand views, you know how I do
First lady, We Run the Streets, now guess who I be
D-I double Z L-E

Let the beat rock
