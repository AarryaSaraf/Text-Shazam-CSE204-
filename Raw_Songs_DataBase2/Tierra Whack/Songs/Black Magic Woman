(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)

Got a black magic woman
Got a black magic woman
I've got a black magic woman
Got me so blind, I can't see
That she's a black magic woman
She's trying to make a devil outta me

Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Stop messing 'round with your tricks
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
Don't turn your back on me, baby
You might pick up my magic sticks

You got your spell on me, baby
You got your spell on me, baby
You got your spell on me, baby
Turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, magic woman
Can't leave you alone

Got me so blind that I can't see
Got me so blind that I can't see
Got me so blind that I can't see
Got me so blind that I can't see
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
(Got me so blind that I can't see)
