Yeah

Been winnin', just ask Ben Simmons
Practice from start to finish
Doc Rivers, layin' up with winners
Embiid, big stepper stampede
Team player like Tyrese Maxey
I get all up in your face like acne
Tobias comin' for the top spot
I'm flyin', tryna beat the shot clock
Shake Milton makes millions
Hard ball, no loss, no feelings
Got green, three rings like Danny
I ball hard for my family

Ain't nothin' but a rebound
Ain't nothin' but a re-
Ain't nothin' but a rebound
Ain't nothin' but a re-
Sorry, gotta ball on ya
I'ma spend it all on ya
Every time I call on ya

Stay down, just trust the process
Been makin' lots of progress
Championship, we comin'
We go and get it, we want it
Assist, yeah, you gotta be swift
You ain't ever seen 'em do it like this
Do a hunnid on seventy-six
Seventy-six
Seventy six
And the crowd goes nuts
And the crowd goes nuts
And the crowd goes nuts
