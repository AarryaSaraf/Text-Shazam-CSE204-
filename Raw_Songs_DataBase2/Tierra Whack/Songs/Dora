I like nice things
Buy me nice things
Give me compliments
Please have common sense

Open the door, tell 'em that you ready to explore
Yeah, Aventador, yeah, I had to chalk him, I got bored
I need support, like a sports bra, bae, I need support
I say less is best but I need more
Shoulda took me shoppin' to the store

I can't fuck with you no more
When I go to sleep Gucci sheets now
Goin' out to eat, don't eat no meat now
Yeah, we from the streets, you get a beat down
Skin tanned 'cause we livin' on the beach now
Shinin' like a diamond, fine dinin'
Forty thousand, turn that shit to fifty thousand
Bitch, I'm wildin', stranded on a island
Money pilin', Rolex 'cause I put that time in
Put the time in

Yeah, open the door, tell 'em you got money but need more
Yeah, in a Porsche, call me a gold digger, yes, of course
I'm in Dior, I think I just might buy me a horse
Basketball game, we on the floor, I need me new bags just to adore

I can't fuck with you no more
When I go to sleep Gucci sheets now
Goin' out to eat, don't eat no meat now
Yeah, we from the streets, you get a beat down
Skin tanned 'cause we livin' on the beach now
Shinin' like a diamond, fine dinin'
Forty thousand, turn that shit to fifty thousand
Bitch, I'm wildin', stranded on a island
Money pilin', Rolex 'cause I put that time in
Put the time in

Yeah, open the door, tell 'em that you tired of bein' poor
I need change, nigga, style galore
Pull up in a tank, ready for war
Thank the Lord, got my passport, take me on tour
Tryna ride the wave, now all aboard
Champagne for the pain, can you pour?

You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
