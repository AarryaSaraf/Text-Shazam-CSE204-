Yeah

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good (Yeah), I'm doin' Meagan Good

I think about how we had nothin' and had dreams of gettin' money
But it seem like when I signed you got jealous, actin' funny
Woulda thought you had a monthly, boy, you took me through hell
I was faithful to you, loyal when you did time in hail
You had rap dreams too, why you ain't write in that cell?
We had the same opportunity, I just chose to prevail
You lost ya homie in '06, rest in peace to Darnell
No disrespect, it's 2020, can't continue to dwell
I was under your spell, had sendin' Venmo and Zelle
While you out here sneakin' bitches in the nicest hotels
Even when you cheated, I felt defeated, but didn't seem it
I went and cheated back, I was heated, now I'm conceited

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good, I'm doin' Meagan Good

I don't regret nothin' we did and I hope you don't neither
I know it irritates your soul, the simple fact I don't need ya
I used to feel like I would die if we wasn't speakin'
Now I feel like I can fly and I found my beacon
My heart want love, so I gotta supply it
Your love wasn't healthy, so I'm on a new diet
I'm through cryin' with you lyin', 'cause I know better than that
Everything you did to me, ain't no editin' that
This ain't no movie, Paul Mooney, you was actin' up
Frontin' on me out in public, now I'm backin' up
I'm gone and I'm packin' up, you missed ya chance, passed it up
Hashtag mad for what? C'mon

I know nothin' last forever but I thought we would
Now you see me doin' better, you wan' treat me good
Should did when you had the chance, yeah, the paper good
I don't wanna take you back, you gon' say I should
Oh, you gon' say I should, I'm doin' Meagan Good
I'm doin' Meagan Good, I'm doin' Meagan Good
