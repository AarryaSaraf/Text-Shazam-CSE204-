Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown

Big whack 'cause I eat a lot
Bitches always begging 'cause they need a lot
Car came with instructions, I don't read a lot
I come from the bottom, gotta feed the block
I don't need a chair, always come prepared
I am like the mayor, I am not the mayor
Gotta say a prayer 'fore I leave the house
Coat hanging off my shoulder, gotta see the blouse
Helmut Lang, don't I look scrumptious?
He keep staring at me like he want this
Million dollar, you cannot afford this
If I wanted I could make the Forbes list

(And I just can't seem to understand where you're coming from, my brother
Guess I'm just not like ya) Yeah
(Not like ya)

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown

I really only smile just to show my grill
Rather have the skill than the sex appeal
Signed a Lego deal just so I can build
Hammer time baby, this is not a drill
Six feet nigga, you ain't lookin' right
Straight edge hanging with the crooked type
First class, told Yeefy book the flight
We are not the same, we just look alike
I can't trust a soul, got the guacamole
Lotta people bold but in person fold
You are not thurl, you're plastic
I am not the queen? Sarcastic

(And I just can't seem to understand where you're coming from, my brother
Guess I'm just not like ya) Yeah
(Not like ya)

Oh, will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Hold your head, hold your crown, hmm
And will the real nigga please stand up
And all the fake sit down?
Let me fix my crown
