Why would I lie
And say I feel good
When I don't feel good?
All I really want is to be happy
And truly... feel good!
I got everybody looking at me
Like why she don't feel good?
I done seen the stars
I done seen the lights
But I can't forget that I'm still hood
Fake smiles never had me sold
Even in the summer my heart cold
Whack why you always be so bold?
Holidays just keep gettin' old...

(Holidays just keep gettin' old...)

Who can I look up to?
When I'm feeling down
Just me and not you
Don't want you around
It goes happy this
It goes happy that
But somehow I cant seem to find happy whack?
Where did she go?

(Holidays just keep gettin' old...)
