This shit feel like I won't ever make it home
Traffics backed up I got to get off of this road (skrt)
Foot on the gas I swear to god I'm in my zone
Foot on the gas I can't stop I got tippy toes (yeah, I'm in my zone)

I got paid today, gas up in my tank, trust me when I say nothing's in my way
Staying in my lane, fast car, racecar games, this car in my name, drop top fuck the rain
Running all red lights, skrting left go right, I know wrong go right, I'm gon' go tonight (go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
If I drive off the bridge, tell them that I live, my life like a kid, captain of my ship (wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy)
If I should lose control, my body and soul, I pray you would know which way to go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

This shit feel like I won't ever make it home
Drive fast, back home I got to get off of this road (skrt)
Foot on the gas I swear to god I'm in my zone
Foot on the gas I can't stop I got tippy toes (yeah, I'm in my zone)

Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light

Red light (stop), green light (go)
Yellow light (slow down), green light (oh no)
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light

Okay, they can't take my attitude
Shortcut, this the avenue
Shit, I had to move, did what I had to do
Doing good to be mad at you
