Can you take me to the art show?
When I'm there it makes my heart go
Boom, boom
Boom, Ba-boom (Yeah), boom
Boom
(Aww hey!) Boom, ba-boom, boom

I wanna get inspired (Hey!)
I'm trying to go higher (Higher!)
I paint a perfect picture (Pic!)
I am the biggest bidder (Ba-boom!)
I love the different colors (Woo!)
They're mixing with each other (Yeah)
It's such a combination (Hey)
I call it integration (Aww!)

Yeah it's freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Free-freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Yeah it's freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Free-freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)

Can you take me to the art show?
When I'm there It makes my heart go
Boom, boom
Boom, Ba-boom (Yeah), boom
Boom
(Aww hey!) Boom, ba-boom, boom

My brain is super wired
I'm hardly ever tired (Higher!)
The writings on the wall
My pencil was involved (Ba-boom!)
I see it like no other (Woo!)
My vision can't be covered
I'm proud of my creations (Hey!)
Hear world domination (Aww!)

Yeah it's freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Free-freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Yeah it's freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)
Free-freedom
(Expression, expression, expression)

Can you take me to the art show?
When I'm there It makes my heart go
Boom, boom
Boom, Ba-boom (Yeah), boom
Boom
(Aww hey!) Boom, ba-boom, boom
