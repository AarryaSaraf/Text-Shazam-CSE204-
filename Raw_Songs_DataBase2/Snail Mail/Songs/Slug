Oh garden slug
What would you give to live like one of us?
Or would you rather wait in the shade?
Just the same as everyday

Oh useless thing
What does another useless day bring?
Did you just lie in place?
Emulated by the way I lie awake

And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

And oh is it easiest to hide?
Under covered rocks
Or would you rather cut it all down?
Just to keep it from dragging you around

And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him
Because there's nothing and there won't ever be
And in moss covered springs you'll never find anything
So what's the use in hiding under our feet?
