Woke up without why or how
Wasted, asleep on the couch
Routine as it is, I can start everyday
Without all the messin' around
Even with a job that keeps me movin'
Most days I just wanna lie down
Sleep it away 'til it's nothin', and
Pull the blinds all the way down, down, down

Sunrise, dead of night
With a come down so early in the mornin'
I hate those long drives
Least we ended things nice
Summer's gotta end sometimes
Oh, Mia

Baby blue, I'm so behind
Can't make sense of the faces in and out of my life
Whirlin' above our daily routines
But we're buried in problems, baby honestly
Wish it'd been you the other night
Should've been you, but it's alright
Feels like I'm losin' my mind, baby blue
But I'd leave it behind if you wanted me to
