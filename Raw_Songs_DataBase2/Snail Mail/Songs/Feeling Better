I thought I was dreaming
'Til the light came through the door
It was more than just a dream
I believed I was drowning
So what'd you wake me up for?

I don't see anyone
Standing in front of me
There's a voice in my ear
Sees what they're not supposed to see
I thought I knew better
Feeling like so much more
Now that I feel so much better
I know that I don't feel any different

I've been anxiously staring at walls for days now
Just waiting on a reply
Oh god will you tell me that I'm not just screaming into silence
So I can know when I've tried

I don't see anyone
Standing in front of me
There's a voice in my ear
Says that I'm not all I'm supposed to be

And all the silence
Cause I'm the only one asleep
It's all dying down
And I know cause I don't feel any different
