I might have made a stranger out of you
And I'm stranger too
No, that's not my perfume on your 
And we won't have long
Does an obsession just become me?
Don't let 'em see
We don't know owe it to nobody
No matter where we are
I'll love you from the city to the stars
But nothing stays as good as how it starts

You and I, like a ship
Forever sailing
You and I, everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

Time tends to pass and make a joke of things
But eleven months and still
Some nights I reach for you
Like you're besides me
You're taking her home
Does an obsession just become you?
You're taking that tone
I see cold, come on
I loved you

Whatever you decide
I'll chase you from the city to the sky
And I lose myself for you
A thousand times

You and I, like a ship
Forever sailing
You and I, everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

You and I (like a ship, forever sailing)
Just you and I (everything we try is failing)
Everything we do
Everything we try

So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what you did
That was so real
And you don't just forget

So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
You don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
You don't just forget
