Isn't it strange
The way it's just over?
No late-night calls
You're not here to walk me to my door
Now I just love you more

Mia, don't cry
I love you forever
But I've gotta grow up now
No, I can't keep holding on to you anymore
Mia, I'm still yours

Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you

Fixin' your hair on the way to his place off Broadway at night
If you're wakin' up slow
Together we'll talk it through the night
But it feels so fuckin' light

Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you
I wish that I could lay down next to you, you
