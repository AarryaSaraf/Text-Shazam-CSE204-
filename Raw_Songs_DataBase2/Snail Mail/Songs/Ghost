Oh, sweet voice
Where have you gone now?
I know if it were your choice
I would be beside you

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room

Do you feel trapped in being your own shadow
I don't see it like that but what would I know

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

Ghost in my wall
Do you see you wither to no one at all
Guide me to nothing
To places where there is no one
The world will lead your body
To  the ground that binds you
So you'll fall above your shoulders
And now I can't even remind you

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

Headfirst now
Go on turn around
Leave it to yourself
No one's gonna help you now

Headfirst now
Leave it to yourself
No one's around
No one's gonna help you now
