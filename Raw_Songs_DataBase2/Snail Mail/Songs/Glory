You want it all
Superstar
Jesus died just to save you
Walk me down Hollywood Boulevard
Get me high in the hotel room

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

When it gets cold
We'll move to Malibu
Where the drinks are hard
You make em' go down smooth
You wanna make it hurt, superstar
When you take too much in the bathroom

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

You owe me
You own me
Couldn't even look at you straight on
Shining in your glory
