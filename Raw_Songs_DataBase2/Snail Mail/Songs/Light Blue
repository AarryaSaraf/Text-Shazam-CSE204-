First time I met you I knew then
That after words there'd be
No in between

We can sail the ocean blue
Or just fly down, you know
How I love you

Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Wanna wake up early every day
Just to be awake
In the same world as you

No one ever hurt you
No more endless nights
Only blue light, it's blues

If anyone should stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now, now, now, now

I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back
