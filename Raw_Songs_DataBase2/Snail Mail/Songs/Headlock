When did you start seeing her?
Guess somebody finally tamed you
Never seen you look so sure

Sorrow snuck into our secret place
Drag me with you to nirvana, baby, take me all the way

Drinking just to taste her mouth
Got you drifting in and out

Mister Death wants my baby now
Felt the crowd was wrong to claim you
Won't they ever quiet down?

Someone's daughter adorned in flames
Drag me with you to nirvana, baby, take me all the way

Man enough to see this through
Man, I'm nothing without you

Thought I'd see her when I died
Filled the bath up with warm water
Nothing on the other side

Man enough to see this through
Or is it one more thing I won't get to?
Can't go out, I'm tethered to
Another world where we're together
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
