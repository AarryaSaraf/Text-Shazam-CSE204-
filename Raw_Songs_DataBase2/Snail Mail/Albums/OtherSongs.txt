// Feeling Like I Do //

Come on baby. Get me into the car
Out on a bender and waiting for you. Get me out of the bar
I don't feel like staying. I just want something to do
I just wanna sleep it off with you. Pour me into you

Come on baby. Get up just to get down
Out on a bender and waiting for you. Count me out on the town
I don't feel like staying. I just want something to do
I just wanna sleep it off with you. Pour me into you

I don't want you feeling like I do. Yeah yeah
I just want you twisted with me too. Yeah yeah
I don't know what I've been trying to prove. Yeah yeah
Every time I get too fucked to move. Yeah yeah

Come on baby. Get me into the car
Out on a bender and waiting for you. Get me out of the bar
I don't feel like staying. I just want something to do

I just want you twisted with me too. Yeah yeah

// The 2nd Most Beautiful Girl In The World //

She fell down
Headfirst in the sound
Tried to stop herself from moving
But it was too profound
Touch her pants
To try to quit your glance
Cause you just notice the dirty way
That American girls dance

Did she go right to your head?
When she danced upon the bed
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?

Later on
To find out she was on
There's nothing so unbearable
As knowing that she's gone
Dream awake
To try to make her stay
You know that you give her everything
But she does it anyway

Did she go right to your head?
When she danced upon the bed?
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?

There's one thing that you will never know
Is how she got to be so (whoa oh oh)
Beautiful
She's unreal
Exactly how it feels
I think they've got a line for it
She invented sex appeal

Did she go right to your head?
When she danced upon the bed?
Is she a dream or is she a drag?
Can she do the shag?
