Album: Valentine

// Valentine //

Let's go be alone
Where no one can see us, honey
Careful in that room
Those parasitic cameras, don't they stop to stare at you?

Can't love for us both
You've gotta live and I gotta go
As long as it's us two
Fuck being remembered, I think I was made for you

So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind

I'd hate to picture someone with you
I lay down and start to cry
You won't believe what just two months do
I'm older now, believe me, I adore you

So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind
So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?

Now I can't hate you
I ruined me for you
Blame me if you need to
But I adore you
I adore you
I adore you
I adore you

// Ben Franklin //

Part two feels like spring
I guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew I would take it
You brought her to flex

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really try
Damn, this time I really tried

Lived on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would have died for me

Raised your voice to me
Second time, I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you never met me

I never should have hurt you
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would have died for me

// Headlock //

When did you start seeing her?
Guess somebody finally tamed you
Never seen you look so sure

Sorrow snuck into our secret place
Drag me with you to nirvana, baby, take me all the way

Drinking just to taste her mouth
Got you drifting in and out

Mister Death wants my baby now
Felt the crowd was wrong to claim you
Won't they ever quiet down?

Someone's daughter adorned in flames
Drag me with you to nirvana, baby, take me all the way

Man enough to see this through
Man, I'm nothing without you

Thought I'd see her when I died
Filled the bath up with warm water
Nothing on the other side

Man enough to see this through
Or is it one more thing I won't get to?
Can't go out, I'm tethered to
Another world where we're together
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?

// Light Blue //

First time I met you I knew then
That after words there'd be
No in between

We can sail the ocean blue
Or just fly down, you know
How I love you

Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Wanna wake up early every day
Just to be awake
In the same world as you

No one ever hurt you
No more endless nights
Only blue light, it's blues

If anyone should stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now, now, now, now

I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back
I'm not goin' back

// Forever (Sailing) //

I might have made a stranger out of you
And I'm stranger too
No, that's not my perfume on your [?]
And we won't have long
Does an obsession just become me?
Don't let 'em see
We don't know owe it to nobody
No matter where we are
I'll love you from the city to the stars
But nothing stays as good as how it starts

You and I, like a ship
Forever sailing
You and I, everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

Time tends to pass and make a joke of things
But eleven months and still
Some nights I reach for you
Like you're besides me
You're taking her home
Does an obsession just become you?
You're taking that tone
I see cold, come on
I loved you

Whatever you decide
I'll chase you from the city to the sky
And I lose myself for you
A thousand times

You and I, like a ship
Forever sailing
You and I, everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

You and I (like a ship, forever sailing)
Just you and I (everything we try is failing)
Everything we do
Everything we try

So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what you did
That was so real
And you don't just forget

So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
You don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
You don't just forget

// Madonna //

You've got a way to you, original Madonna
Won't make the rest just go away
Spent the money, throwing ones at supermodels
Everybody wants to taste the wine
Line around the block, the judgment time
And how could you deny them that?

Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention's too much work
I don't need absolution, it just hurts
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now

I consecrate my life to kneeling at your altar
My second sin of seven being wanting more
Could that have been the smell of roses, backseat lover?
Praying you'll fill my empty cup
Cursing myself for even getting dressed up

Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention was too much work
I don't need absolution, no, it just hurts
We're not really talking now

Body and blood, all the time
Get to it now where we can fight on the phone
I just wanna get even, I'll just get soaked
Body or divinity
Gonna wipe the dirt off me

I love the sickness, baby
Of holding on tight, I don't know why
I've come to hate my body
No it's not yours, no it's not mine
I don't know why, oh I don't know why but
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now

// c. Et Al. //

Woke up without why or how
Wasted, asleep on the couch
Routine as it is, I can start everyday
Without all the messin' around
Even with a job that keeps me movin'
Most days I just wanna lie down
Sleep it away 'til it's nothin', and
Pull the blinds all the way down, down, down

Sunrise, dead of night
With a come down so early in the mornin'
I hate those long drives
Least we ended things nice
Summer's gotta end sometimes
Oh, Mia

Baby blue, I'm so behind
Can't make sense of the faces in and out of my life
Whirlin' above our daily routines
But we're buried in problems, baby honestly
Wish it'd been you the other night
Should've been you, but it's alright
Feels like I'm losin' my mind, baby blue
But I'd leave it behind if you wanted me to

// Glory //

You want it all
Superstar
Jesus died just to save you
Walk me down Hollywood Boulevard
Get me high in the hotel room

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

When it gets cold
We'll move to Malibu
Where the drinks are hard
You make em' go down smooth
You wanna make it hurt, superstar
When you take too much in the bathroom

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

You owe me
You own me
Couldn't even look at you straight on
Shining in your glory

// Automate //

One more drink 'til I can feel you
And when the party's empty
We can slow-dance in my room
Tried life without you
But you in that green sweater...

I could die if I had the guts
Puked it up, drank too much
Feed the flame forever

Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

Blank lips, dark room
I pretend it's you
But she kissed like she meant it

It's like I'm living and I'm past her
And it's thirteen days after
But it still feels like I'm cheating

One more drink 'til I can lie beside you
Though all at once is better

Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out

And I'm like your dog
I'm like your dog
Only I know you'll be sweet if I stay

It's not enough
Conditional love
When I'm old and rotten you'll be on your way

I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
And childishly I'm lonely
When it's time to clear out the party
Automate me

// Mia //

Isn't it strange
The way it's just over?
No late-night calls
You're not here to walk me to my door
Now I just love you more

Mia, don't cry
I love you forever
But I've gotta grow up now
No, I can't keep holding on to you anymore
Mia, I'm still yours

Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you

Fixin' your hair on the way to his place off Broadway at night
If you're wakin' up slow
Together we'll talk it through the night
But it feels so fuckin' light

Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you
I wish that I could lay down next to you, you
