Yeah!
I know y'all already know what it is
Damn!
Too much inspiration
Here we go

Back when I was a freshman, I learned a valuable lesson
A ho gon' be a ho and it don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, staining her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one (uh) one on one


I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you


Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely 'cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda, coulda, and woulda, uh
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one


I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you


Ain't talking about commitment
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-digging bitch
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
But you a fine lil' sexy thang
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop (uh)


I, I don't want no girlfriend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)
I, I don't want no girlfriend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you


Girl, bye, I.e
Get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich
I love you
Only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
Kisses, toodles
Ah, lil' me
