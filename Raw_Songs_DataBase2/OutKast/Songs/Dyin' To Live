My suit is dark my clouds are gray
And all things around me pass away
Well what if I leave
Yeah that's what I'll do I'll leave

'Cause 88 keys is all I got to lose
That ain't much, you can have them shoes

I'm dying to love dying to play
Dying to get out of here
I'm dying to live

Percival (oh)
Says goodbye (oh)
An angel dies
