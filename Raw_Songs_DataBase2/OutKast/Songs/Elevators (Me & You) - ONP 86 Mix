One for the money yes uh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just trying to find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go around trying to catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes trying to find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we making the crowd move but we not making no G's
And that's a no no


Yeah, uh, check it
Ah one two, ah one two doe, niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say motherfuck that playing, they paying
We stay in laying vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yeah them niggas they making big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon' be that year that all y'all player haters can bite me
...around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors


Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smoking them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's and they looking like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dicks, now
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors


Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from, some nigga was saying something
Talking bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smiling like a clown
Facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been going through the same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop so we just gonna continue

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
