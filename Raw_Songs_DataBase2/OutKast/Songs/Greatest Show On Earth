How y'all feeling tonight?
I don't give a damn
Mama, I'm leaving way from home to join the circus

And Papa, I'm going to the place where them clowns get down.. get down
Sister, I know that there are lions, tigers, and bears
I'll be safe and sure to call y'all when I get there!


The, the, the, the greatest show on Earth
(Shut up while I'm singing!) Step right up, step right up, come one, come all
What you want, what you need
Wanna drank, wanna chief
I got it yeah... I got it


Momma, I'm moving up and I'll be selling cotton candy
And poppa next week they'll let me sit on the trapeze-eze... whoo!
Uncle you should see all these dancing girls
And every night I get to sleep under the big top


The, the, the, the greatest show on Earth
(Shut up while I'm singing!) Step right up, step right up, come one, come all
What you want, what you need
Wanna drank, wanna chief
I got it yeah... I got it


Ooh whoa
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls!
please give it up for the amazing chorus!


The, the, the, the greatest show on Earth
(Shut up while I'm singing!) Step right up, step right up, come one, come all
What you want, what you need
Wanna drank, wanna chief
I got it yeah... I got it


Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
I got, I got, I got good love
I got true love, I got green love
I got blue love, I got dark love
I got light love, I got white love
I got chocolate love, I got plaid love
I got striped-ed love
What you clapping for, I ain't done yet!
