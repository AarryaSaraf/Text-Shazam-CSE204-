Album: Idlewild

// Peaches //

[Scar and Sleepy Brown:]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Big Boi:]
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball... And every time you see the family they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the hide the spouse in the house
Boy it's cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker, shit, goddamn asshole)
Took my shit (bitch!) fuck!

[Scar and Sleepy Brown:]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Big Boi:]
It was the night that they done dipped
And all throughout the palace
Death didn't do us part, heart broke or no more marriage (Bitch!)
When it happens you'll be slappin' yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you're sittin' in the courthouse, plaintiff and defendant (Bitch)
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid see she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time with the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin' I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin' around (Hey baby)

[Scar and Sleepy Brown:]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Sleepy Brown, Scar and Big Boi:]
Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around 'cause you know
That I'm tryna change but it's hard 'cause I've been this way
(Man you already knew that shit)

[Scar and Sleepy Brown:]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

// Intro //

[André 3000:]
Ah, yes, well I myself, Larry Olivier, am a method actor, and I studied at the prestigious school of Julliard, and you know, I feel as if, you know, the rappers, and the musicians, and what not, get into acting, you know, you know, it's disrespecting the craft. I feel as if, you know, they're taking jobs from us, from us trained actors and I feel as if they should just leave it to the pros

[Big Boi:]
Man, shut your ass up. You telling me if you made a song and it was jamming, we ain't 'posed to listen to it? Man, these boys got opportunity man, let them do they thing. And why you talkin' like that? Ain't you from Bankhead? Anyway, I heard that that Idlewild shit gonna be fire. I'mma be there on Friday, and where yo pussy ass gonna be nigga? Tryna get some work. Think you Denzel or somebody

[Janelle Monaé:]
Did I just hear y'all say that new Outkast movie come out on Friday?

[Big Boi:]
Yeah, shawty

[Janelle Monaé:]
Hell yeah I'm gon' be there, and who this fuck nigga is? Anyway, who he supposed to be?

[Big Boi:]
I don't know, I don't know that nigga

[Janelle Monaé:]
See that's how niggas get jumped on. He better watch his mouth, talkin' 'bout actin'. He need to act like he got some sense up in this bitch

[Big Boi:]
Hell yeah. Aye, you gonna buy me some popcorn?

// Mighty O //

Odee odee odee oooooo

You ain't a hater? Can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty but the study gon' unveil
My relative in jail, ha! Stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper but I'm tangled in my cord (hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsels in distress but they're a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they're getting warmer
They're only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right
But hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category, ain't got none, you know I'm right

[Big Boi:]
Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga, so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firing on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue; 'cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, a sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go 'head recycle, repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No JR period, senior, 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction, Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Caine, I want you to go out there
Kill them marks and come back, is you with me?
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow

[André 3000:]

Some call it midnight blue
Some call it navy blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do

'Til there ain't no more blues

Do-doo-do-do do-doo-do-do

// N2U //

[Big Boi:]
Yeah!
I know y'all already know what it is
Damn!
Too much inspiration
Here we go

Back when I was a freshman, I learned a valuable lesson
A ho gon' be a ho and it don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, staining her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one (uh) one on one

[Sleepy Brown:]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Big Boi:]
Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely 'cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda, coulda, and woulda, uh
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one

[Sleepy Brown:]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Khujo Goodie and Big Boi:]
Ain't talking about commitment
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-digging bitch
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
But you a fine lil' sexy thang
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop (uh)

[OutKast and Khujo Goodie:]
I, I don't want no girlfriend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)
I, I don't want no girlfriend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)

I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Big Boi:]
Girl, bye, I.e
Get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich
I love you
Only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
Kisses, toodles
Ah, lil' me

// Morris Brown //

[Big Boi and Sleepy Brown:]
Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double-D-Y Fatt Saxx
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Sharp as a tack like I just left church (Clean)
Bark then attack when the shit won't work (Mean)
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know what's really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can go o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

[Scar:]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band

Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

[Big Boi and Sleepy Brown:]
Two dope boys in the Cadillac, still
'Kast wear the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshal (Shut her down; time to go!)
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long, now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Exotic, melodic melodies, yep, we got it
Funkin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it

[Scar:]
Music makes the world go 'round

Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

I'm tippin' my hat off to ya baby
'Cause you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' 'Hi'
I'm so gone over you
And yes, it's true
Baby, do what you do
My nose is open so wide (So wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (So wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (My sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (This is how it sounds)

Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'

Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby

// Chronomentrophobia //

[André 3000:]
Chronomentrophobia
The fear of clocks
The fear of time
Yeah

High as the cost of living
Oh
I take what I've been given
Pastor say, "Be strong"
Ooh, yeah, hey
I ain't got time, leave me alone
Ain't that much time left, I've got to funk you now

Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

Lord be having mercy on my soul
I'm having the impression that my life gon' be a bowl
Of cherries, but it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975, never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Tryna find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go, I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books; let's stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good; you enter my hood, you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone, y'all remember this
What we stood for: "Fuck that fame and that glitz"
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful, know what corners you be bending
Revelations, getting impatient, and now, I'm dead
Remember what I said; I'm gone, bow your heads

// The Train //

All aboard
Or, are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
(God don't make no mistakes)
(God don't make no mistakes)

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

[Sleepy Brown:]
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Welcome to my life, I think it's time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt

(Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go...)

[Sleepy Brown:]
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
Cus when your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy, stop!!

Before you say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)

[Sleepy Brown:]
It's been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

// Life Is Like A Musical //

N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical

I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
'Cause ain't nothing changed (it's simple)
Hey let's make a musical

Based on fact and faction
Or verse, vica throw in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
'Cause things have changed (it's all hood)
The Kast go Hollywood

Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em

Don't

// No Bootleg DVDs (Interlude) //

DVD's, got them bootleg Idlewild DVDs
What you got? What you got?
What's up Sean?
Come here man, come here, come here, come here, come here

Got them bootleg Idlewild DVDs
Got Girls Gone Idlewild
I got the uncut version of the Idlewild

The G version just in case
You don't want to see Three take his shirt off
I got the director's cut of Idlewild

I got that kush man, I got that 'dro
I got that purp', I got that light pink
Let me see your teeth
Boy I can make you a grill, right now

Gimme two, naw, your shit kinda buck
Give me about thirteen minutes
Dig what I'm sayin'?

Shit, I heard Big and Dre are
Supposed to be comin' up here right now anyway
Well shit man, let me drop on out of here man like a roller coaster baby
I'll get up with you

// Hollywood Divorce //

[André 3000:]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Lil Wayne:]
And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they're just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane – Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne, don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do

[André 3000:]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is for Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourth of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get, get, get, get, get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

[Big Boi:]
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the Internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
(Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

[André 3000:]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Snoop Dogg:]
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

[André 3000 and Snoop Dogg:]
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang

// Zora (Interlude) //

You trying to leave here without us? 

Come on this way, both of ya'll, come on this way...come on this way 
Let me get a sample first 

Keep your ass away from my husband

// Call The Law //

[Big Boi:]
Zora and Rooster under peach tree
They're K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow, first came he love
Now, then comes the marriage
1, 1, 1, baby, 2, baby, 3, baby carriage, baby

[Janelle Monáe:]
Welcome to my world oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl 'cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl 'cause she loves to fight them)
But I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy
Ooh-wee, you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin' on Broadway, you and I
I was bein' your baby and tickin' your tock and yo' clock
See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good
And I was dreamin' 'bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me (it meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up 'til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up 'til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin', ain't no feelin' left it's just the killin'
Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

[Big Boi:]
Oh, baby, it's mo', baby, it's workin' on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like "boohoo" then "boo" "fuck you" and "fuck you too"
(Fuckin' bitch)
Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now.. Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
That's hard... It's all yours... Good God!

[Janelle Monáe:]
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up 'til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up 'til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin', ain't no feelin' left it's just the killin'
Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

[Janelle Monáe and Big Boi:]
You comin' home
Zora
But the birds are gone
Zora, is that a pistol?
With their sad songs
What you fin' to do wit' that?
They're showin' off
C'mon, baby—put the gun down
But they might be wrong
Shittin' me!
I really wish you could change, baby
Well if my best ain't good enough, I don't know what to tell ya
Reclaim your throne
I'm the king of this castle
Down here in the darkness
C'mon, baby—hold up!

[Janelle Monáe:]
If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up 'til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up 'til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin', ain't no feelin' left it's just the killin'
Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

// Bamboo & Cross (Interlude) //

[Bamboo:]
The music's starting
My name is B-A-M-B-O-O
I'm so fast and everybody is slow
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop
He farts a lot and plus drools a lot and he's sleeping a lot

[Cross:]
You don't kill me like that!
My name is Cross
I am the boss
I'm a vicious bowler
I wear a Polo – with the horse on it
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheelie
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!
I can't remember
I want to dance
Can I dance?

// Buggface //

"Can I dance?"

Aw shit
Big Boi! Big Boi!

[Big Boi:]
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze you when you gathering yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
'Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the motherfuckin' boundaries, an ounce of weed
Or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their show, dad?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads
You know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program
(Fuck the learning curve) We took our ramp to No Man's Land
Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

When I'm left alone, I get to thinking to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now, analyzing every step (step)
Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beating through yo' chest (chest)
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject clearly I'm a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you acting like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
'Cause the ticket is a one-way, (clearly) back we won't be coming
Bugg!

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

"Can I dance?"
Oh shit, Bamboo! You gonna break get outta here, you 'bout to break something!
(Stop!) Y'all just playing around now y'all just playing around
Come on Cross! (what?) You can hear the music from there

// Makes No Sense At All //

Man y'all play too much
Now now Percival, don't fret
We're here to help you
I told you to bring good songs... what are you gonna do now?
Look at the keys... well... you gotta do something
Keep your eyes on the keys... here's looking at you kid
Okay okay... well... make up something... yeah right
You won't make sense... I don't know let's try it
Here we go

(You got that right)
Out of touch, out of tune, butter knife, tea spoon
(Now what was that)
Razz-a-matazz, Thing-a-majig, whatchamacallit, bullshit
So and so, such and such (bullshit!) pretty much
(I think I'm gonna throw up)

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah)

1 and 1 makes 2, 2 and 2 makes 4, 4 and 4 makes 8 and 8 makes 16

See I pissed him off

// In Your Dreams //

[Janelle Monae and Sleepy Brown:]
We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

[Big Boi:]
The moon is now my sun and the nights are now my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean, I'm in between sunset and sunrise
Since it's on, type of nigga for the home invasion, surprise-prise
Motherfucker, pow-pow, lay the fuck down now
Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you
(Why?) I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it
Pardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent
Ha ha ha ha

[Janelle Monae and Sleepy Brown:]

[Killer Mike:]
Typical day off in the A, aye
But Nicks own the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob, okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust their motherfuckin' head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

You're ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
As the wheels
Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck

// PJ & Rooster //

[Trumpet and Percy Jr.:]
Hey Percy Jr., Percy Jr... wha-wha-what's that
What's that you playing?
Working on something new
Sound like some bullshit
I mean you really think the audience is gonna appreciate that?
Well, Rooster say I can play what I wanna
No, never mind anything that Rooster tell ya
You gonna play the stuff I like, okay?

[André 3000:]
Ain't nobody like my style, yeah
I light my fire, yeah
(I light my fire, I light my fire!)
They blow it out, yeah
(They blew it out, they blew it out!)
And don't nobody gonna feel like that, no
Monkeys on my back crawl
Now watch them all fall
Gon' fall! Look out!

Nobody wanted to dance
When I had a lot of time on my hands
Now I gotta lot of hands on my time
And everybody wanna be a friend of mine
Whoa, whoa! I wouldn't mind a friend
The fellas back home all tryna win
Moon keeps shining on bootleg bottles
Cops in the street, keep yo' feet on the throttle
Sellin' what you got, can't afford they model
Yelling, "Go PJ, go!"

Ain't no Idle; everything is Wild, yeah
You can be here now, yeah
(Sometimes you turn around)
Be in the ground, yeah
(Or die six feet underground)
And ain't no bible at this here church, no
You won't find God, no
Might meet Him first, oh
Oh, God! Look out!

Nobody wanted to leave
House so packed that we couldn't even breathe
And ain't no better place to fall in love
Angels sent from heaven above
Swing down! They gon' change ya life
You might make a baby, might meet ya wife
But one sure thing that you gonna say
Deep down south rustling in yo' place
Them Idlewild cats man they don't play
Don't make me send the telegram to Rooster, he'll shoot ya

[Taffy:]
You better come harder than that sweetie!
This ain't no mortuary!

[Big Boi:]
And you don't wanna take it to the gat so soon
Stinking to ya Jenkins, waiting in the upper room
Tell ya maker, say ya prayers, we some playas but you made us
Mashed potatoes, bad potato, blast you hater, blast the gator
So you might just wanna kick back and drink roots
Take hat to ya woman, relax, break loose
Cause pret' soon if she choose, she gon' walk away from you
Straight to the Rooster cause he's cock-a-doodle poo
What they do fool?
Who's tryna run a small time crap shooting
All time fat chewing, hats got the matching suit and lens
All cats pursuing, kinda wild, it's Idlewild
Time to break it on, break it on down now
Percival take it on out!

[André 3000:]
Say whoa Mammy!... whoa Mammy!
Say whoa Pappy!... whoa Pappy!
Say whoa Mammy!... whoa Mammy!
Say whoa Pappy!... whoa!

// Mutron Angel //

In the eye of the storm
Looking out through the rain
Gabriel, blow your horn
They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane

Gangsta ride right in the nick of time
Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind

Hear a thunderous voice
Shouting there will be no peace
Until our people rejoice
When every boy and girl is freed
You see it's going down
The wars and the mysteries
But my friends there'll be better days
And a better way
According to the prophecy

It would be so nice
To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go
Or are you in the know
Like all the way up sunshine

You been a friend of mine

Gangsta ride right in the nick of time
Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind

You been a friend of mine

It would be so nice
To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go
Or are you in the know
Like all the way up sunshine

// When I Look In Your Eyes //

Hey
Uh-huh
Well, all right
How y'all doing?
Yes, ma'am
Looking mighty fine

I've been around the world
Seen so many pretty girls
But I still get overwhelmed
When I look in your eyes

Been from Maine to Spain
But everything seems the same
I only feel the change
When I look in your eyes

I know you're upper-class
I know you've got pizzas
Every man wanna kiss yo'
And I do too

Sometimes I'm just a clown
And everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around
When I look in your eyes

Tell me what's a man to do
To get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool
When I look in your eyes

Don't tell me no this time
If you do, it'll blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
It's an awful thing

I guess it's time to say goodbye
But I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied
When I look in your eyes

Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet
When they stink
(How can...)

How can I let you down?
I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded
When I look in your eyes

I'm dying to love dying to play
Dying to get out of here
I'm dying to live

Says goodbye (oh)
