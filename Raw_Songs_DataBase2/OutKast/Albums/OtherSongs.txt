// B.O.B. (Zack De La Rocha Remix) //

[André 3000:]
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—HOT!
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah!

[André 3000 (Morris Brown College Gospel Choir):]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
(Bombs over Baghdad!)

[Big Boi:]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but cha copped a dub
Should've held back, but cha threw the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but cha packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, there for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity pat rappers trying to get to 5
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, high!

[André 3000 (Morris Brown College Gospel Choir):]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Yeah, don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
(Bombs over Baghdad!)
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
(Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah!)

[Morris Brown College Gospel Choir:]
Bombs over Baghdad! Yeah!

// Benz or Beemer //

"It all started at an accident scene on Bankhead and Ashby
It's not clear if the suspect caused it; it is clear he wielded
A hammer and told ..... to get out of his car."

[Big Boi:]
Yeah, now check it
From alligator belts to patty melts, I be that smoothest nigga
So how do you figure that Atlanta don't be pulling them triggers?
The Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch
Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin' that wickedness
See one is for the money, two is for my niggas who jack
Niggas ain't takin' that shit no mo', they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so what you wanna be startin' now?
I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul

[André 3000:]
Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow
I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth your life
I don't know about yours, but if so, you smoking pipes, right?

Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

Deep in the Dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around them blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Getting deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question
The world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nothing but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke
Nothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke

[Big Boi:]
I'm travellin' up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys
Be activating that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
'Cause it's like this

Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in Call of the Wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin' about a hundred miles
The world is fucked up how these niggas be driving drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the car does not belong, I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin' spree, look at me, W-M-B backwards
Takin' you to the chop shop with these verses
Comin' around the projects make you sleep off in them hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin' a physical therapist, 'cause you can't fuck with this

[André 3000:]
While you sat down by the seashore thinkin' about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin' about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parking lot
I'm hearin' a voice in the back of my head yelling "Andre stop!"
But do I stop, naw, I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin' down 'cause the folks wanna run up
Bang!

Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

(Mmm...drop)

"These days, the best way to deal with a carjacker
Is to simply give them what they want."

// Da Art of Storytellin' (Remix) //

[Big Boi:]
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, 'cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin' poster, it's like that now

[Sleepy Brown and Big Boi:]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[André 3000:]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party but you cannot call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit, we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking 'bout what we gon' be when we grow up
I said, "What you wanna be?" she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song, and hoping, at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

[Sleepy Brown, Big Boi and Slick Rick:]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
(Uncle Ricky) Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah (Can you tell us a story?)
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
(Please?) Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
Here we go

[Slick Rick:]
Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next, she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, a number confirming
Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss
While she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
With this small chain wearing muh-fucker trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another soothe me
But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bitty
But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady
Knahmean?

[Sleepy Brown, Big Boi and Slick Rick:]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now

[André 3000:]
Now sittin' in the bathtub listening to the Isley
Brothers and others outside my door want to despise me
Reminds me that everyone ain't cool, the world is jealous
Never could understand when my mama use to tell us
"Don't take your food outside around your friends
Unless you got enough to feed the neighborhood"
The play has just began, follow me now
Act 1 Scene 2 the date 1/1/96 the time I don't know
Mood disturbed, Dre goes on to say they're trying to get over
Like them niggas with the blinker on, I got my thinker on
So I'm like 'Word, however you want to act is fine'
That is real as fishing rods
I might be kissing God but I'm still in the battle
So if you got cattle you best be fasting
For 7 days and 7 nights we everlasting
20 years young on a quest to get my class ring
Just for them fhite wolks, I will if it's the last thing
I do

Yeah, slick, know what I'm sayin', I'm gonna tell you like this
Just 'cause I live the apartment don't mean you can keep puttin' these notes under my windshield, I'm tellin' you
Shorty gon' bust your ass about that shit

Check it, hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all, hoes
Back up in this bitch rippin' tracks like I'm supposed
Tommy and Ralph Lauren don't like niggas to wear their clothes
Where your proof at? Who's that? Talking shit like those
Keepin' the rumors up, I wish I lived in a fuckin' cave
I ride the streets in Lexus, all these crows they wanna be saved
Go to college, get a job 'cause all you want to do is shake
I use to hit Club Nikki's but I gave that shit a break
Just like Maaco, Waco, burn it to the ground
I bet you eatin' that pork when your partners ain't around
Backdraft, scenes of Shaft splackin' these hoes just like he's supposed to
Quote you: "Big Boi is the pimp ass nigga that formed you"
Like pottery, sloppily, playin' hoes like lotteries
OutKast did the dirt and now you swear your shit is poppin' see
You bit (beats), we makin' hits, so give me your flag back
I'm living in the SWATS so you may call me Daddy Fat Sax
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Like this

One in a million men passing the J off in the culture
Don't y'all smoke a couple of pounds and get tore up y'all
And tear the devil headquarters down to the grizzound
Is how we hit the house and puff a couple of good pounds
Of good weed, PeeWee, my nigga Little Beewee
We need a 50 box of Phillies and some bouncin' titties
From the Magic, the Flame
Nikki's too, and share in Sequel's
Never payin' for no pussy
You can shake it, you can keep it to yourself, hoe

[André 3000:]
You left your morals at the door, when you stepped in, crept in
Naked as babies at the beach, so
Now you wonder why your nigga done bust you in the fore
Head, ain't no respect there, so now you just assed out like breech
Delivery, slivery got you swung on
These types of things go on from here to Bowen Home to London
England, Wall Street to y'all street
Sometimes I get bewildered and it throws a nigga like me off beat
But I'm back on it
Because we lasting 'ever, sound good, don't it?
Rattling your trunks like FAMU and the component
Said that's it—man, fuck that shit
On and on and on and I'm out

// Funkin' Around //

[André 3000:]
Hello, well good evening, ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like, really, like, the South
It's like cool to be from the South right about now
Girls, listen up

[André 3000:]
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin'
"What the fuck you mean-mean?"
See, we ain't even seen the mountaintop
Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
Hand-me-downs and canned goods
Won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board
Can't afford to lose, y'all make me yawn
1/1/91... my teacher sees potential in me, said, "Sit down, son"
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wasn't no other way to word it, got my feelings murdered
By the bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up, little mama, I'm about to react

Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

[Sleepy Brown:]
People have ya party, but please don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Grab your partner, roll around, and feel the sound, ah baby
People have ya party, and don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate

[Big Boi:]
While Scotty is beamin', lil' Pookie 'nem schemin'
What's the use of living, my nigga?
While you snoozing, I'm dreamin', I'm Tylenol PM
You amount to the same thing every day like per diem
Never tryin' to be nothing but a damn "What you're being"
One nation under the cool should be the rule
Whether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school
Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates
Daddy Fat Sax, can they have your back? Naw!
Ooh! You're such a playa
Ooh! Your Southern drawl got me sprawled out
In your black book, my name was crossed out
Went from starting to second-string, now in the doghouse (Woof!)
Reminiscing, the party you was missing
Instead of arguments, you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take
You better bounce, rock, roller-skate

[André 3000:]
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah

// In Due Time //

[Cee-Lo Green:]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Big Boi:]
When that nigga be thinkin' of cruising, the Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed, under the arm rest, under the leather
And thinkin' of startin' ways to make my life a little bit better
Than the dope peddler
Never to pay no fucking taxes
Takin' a chunk up out of my checks and makin' my rhymes just look like practice
Buying clothing, Range Roving with my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South, my crew ain't 'bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy
They talkin' about they fucked my hoes and that they could have been me
You lookin' to be the butterfly, without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right 'cause you gon' make it, I swear my nigga
Or collapse one, fallin' a victim to your greed, boi
You're lookin' to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed, boi
The information in my skull be pokin' some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence, they got y'all niggas breakin' boulders
For quick money

[Cee-Lo Green:]
Struggling's just a part of my day
Many obstacles have been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we here in the first place
They can't believe 'cause they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating

Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[André 3000:]
Uh, who said good folks is not supposed to die?
The same nigga that said niggas is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure for AIDS but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough
To make a difference 'fore this motherfucker up and blow
In pieces
I could think of many reasons
Only when shit is going bad, you want to holla Jesus
Fuck a pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin'
From crawling
Got these niggas thinkin' they really ballin'
When they isn't
Don't take my word, there's niggas off in prison
That will tell you
That's locked up for long time and won't sell you no flex
So congregation, will you turn your text
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one
The first one that feel me, jump up and make a joyful noise
You's OutKast-ed, meaning, now you have a choice, like that

[Cee-Lo Green:]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

// Land Of A Million Drums //

[André 3000 and Sleepy Brown:]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Big Boi:]
In the land of a million drums
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalactic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm trying to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talking about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pit bull on him before he could pass one blow
Scooby-doo, scooby-doo, scooby damn doo, scooby doo (Scooby doobie doo)

[André 3000 and Sleepy Brown:]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Killer Mike:]
Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy, wake up, we've been had
Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash
He said, "Who, who?"
I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'ma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash trying to get our stash back
Rounding up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need him?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

[André 3000 and Sleepy Brown:]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[André 3000:]
Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder 'til the walls come tumbling down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cause I want y'all all to know
We rock the world

[André 3000 and Sleepy Brown:]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddling kids
(Oh oh, oh no)

// Movin' Cool (The After Party) //

Cool, moving cool, moving cool

[Andre 3000:]
Cool, moving cool

[Andre 3000 & Joi:]
Moving cool, moving cool, yeah

Hey, hey!

I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around, you don't have to much to say
La, la-la, la-la, whoo, whoo

[Andre 3000:]
You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe with a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else

'Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

[Joi:]
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

'Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

'Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

[Big Boi:]
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad excuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollipop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty P's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool

'Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

[Andre 3000:]
'Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner)

// Phobia //

[Big Rube:]
The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
Of the night and somebody in your room
Your heart starts beating so fast, you can hear it pumping
The veins in your temples pulsate as you stare at the intruder
Then after a few minutes, you realize he ain't moving
So finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light
And the killer turns into your coat throwed over the chair
The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning
And two or three motherfuckers cross the street
Your senses heighten, reflexes sharpen, vision's enhanced Adrenaline flows
As they rush across the street, you leave the print from the heater grip in your palm
Then your heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just going to the store
Many of us mistake phobia for true fear
Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation
Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence
Through stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification, they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie
Death is a small price to pay for respect
Death is a small price to pay for respect
You know who it is; you know what it is
Peace out

[André 3000:]
In these troubling times, a nigga like me be thinking of rhymes
That makes my quarters, nickels, plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be looking for trouble, it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes sir, guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes could attract so much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore I'm heated just like a kitchen
Full of pots and pan, Glock's in hand
Shots, rung out like ringin' the bells
And then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it would come to this conclusion
The folks that throwed us on them boats should be the one's I'm bruisin'
But naw, we don't see it that way
In '94 this is the real, it ain't no time for play play
Better believe the players on the loose
Need to get their head screwed on tight
When it really get down to the nitty grit, who gon' fight?
Pipe, down
'Cause ain't no better time to crank it up than right now
We gots the Seagram crunk down here
And I don't hear nobody disagreeing
Orga-no-i-z-e, Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi

[Big Boi:]
So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' every day, so player, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

See why in the mother-fuck, do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit and be lettin' that pistol go buck?
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
See yes indeed I got that weed like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out and then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make a ho pull up her skirt
I drunk that Erk & Jerk, boi, thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink and then I got more nuts off
Cough, it's time to be out, sees bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit on the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul the way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga, I spit it, I did it, y'all suckers need to quit it
'Cause it's real

So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' every day, so player, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

Well, it's that nigga that be wearing Nautica V-necks and Polo sweats
I got some food up in your thoughts and that cess off in your chest
See, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93
See, that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yee
And when we rock it, niggas be jocking just like jock itch
You snitch, I fucked your bitch
See and my niggas G'd that ho
On the Southside of Campbellton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin', she was just a horny toad
See, I'm a mystery like the killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily clockin' the hoes when I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
Smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map and now I close the curtains

[André 3000:]
Now shit done got boring ass
Molin' when XS closed down
But niggas kept soarin', steerin'
Stirrin', being the pharm assistant that missed
Other folks but some people tend to joke about this
But it's really dead serious
You can bet my lyrics
Now ya wonder why that we done stopped and got curious
Wanting to know where I'm from and where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable living give me meat
Can I get that; ya wonder why we split back
Lure us into pitch black dark
But I sit back and spark another one
To leave ya discombobulated in that dust
Living in a world where in nobody do you trust
Then hustlin' became a major trade, but
Us in major trouble 'cause we made, uh
Too many mistakes off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world and now we laugh
'Cause it's all false
Either way ya go, ya gotta pay the cost

[Big Boi:]
So don't spend your whole life

Spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right (2506084)

I'm smokin' and drinkin' every day, so player, fuck a job
Educated and black, hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob, nigga yeah

Take you a little higher, know what I'm sayin'?
When you learnin', when you burnin' up that smoke
So you can choke on my quote
And get my ... down your throat
You just don't understand, you know what I'm sayin'?
Organized Noize for '95, bitch!

// The Whole World //

[Andre 3000:]
"Okay, here we go..."
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

[Killer Mike:]
Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

[Big Boi:]
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
