// Brown Eyes //

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

In my dream I met this girl
We were in love at Port Royal's Cove
I promised her I'd show her the world
But now I'm awaken and there is no girl

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

Now I've heard that dreams come to life
And if this is true she'll be my wife
Crazy they call me but soon they'll see
We'll be as one and live in harmony, yeah

I've seen a lot of girls and man they're fine
And they're fine, so fine
Not one of them compare to mine
No not one, no not one
She's got the cutest little smile, yeah man
She's got the cutest little smile
I'm looking for the one with big brown eyes

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

Sailing down the coast in my little rowboat
In my little rowboat
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Ain't found her yet got a ways to go
Gotta find that girl and make her mine, yeah man
Gotta make her mine
Oh she's the one with the big brown eyes

I've seen a lot of girls and man they're fine
And they're fine, so fine
Not one of them compare to mine
No not one of them compare to mine
She's got the cutest little smile, yeah man
She's got the cutest little smile
I'm looking for the one with big brown eyes

// Reggae Street //

Well you got your funk on funky Broadway
And you got the blues on your Basin Street
And you got the rock on Electric Avenue
Where I want to take you is something new
See the people dressed in red, gold and green
And strictly lion control the scene
You can get sugar cane and coconut water
Well you know it's good for youth, man and daughter

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, groovin' to the reggae beat

Here some people dress in foreign clothes
How they got here, heaven knows
Some do the breakdance on the corner
Tell you man it's hot, hot, hot, hot on ya'

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, jam to the reggae beat

Come along, I'll take you there
I don't care what kind of clothes you wear
Eh, just a come on clean
Come along, come along

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat

Keep on rockin'
Keep on rockin' to the reggae street
On reggae street
Keep on rockin', rockin' on reggae street
Keep on rockin' on reggae reggae reggae reggae

// Now And Forever //

Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, where you belong
Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, you're number one

Now and forever, once and for all
You and I, we will get by
Now and forever, once and for all
You and I need not be shy

For what is life, it's what we make of it
Everyone has a place to fit
So blaze a new trail from a tale that's old
Sing a new song that's yet unfold, untold

Now and forever, once and for all
Work your plan, it's all in your hands
Now and forever, once and for all
Work your plan, you're number one

Yes what is life, it's what we make of it
Everyone has their place to fit
It's for us to dare, for us to win
Through laughter and tears, through thick and thin, you win

Now and forever, once and for all
Love is here, so make it clear
Now and forever, once and for all
Love is here, so have no fear

Now and forever, now and forever, you and I
Now and forever, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now and forever, you and I, you and I

Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, live up youth one, you're number one
Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, live up youth one, you're number one

Now and forever, once and for all
Make your plan, live up youth one, you're number one
Now and forever, once and for all...
