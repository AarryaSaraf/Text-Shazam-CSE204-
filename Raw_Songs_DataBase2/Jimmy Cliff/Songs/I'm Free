Whoa, I'm free, nobody now owns me
Yes, I'm free, nobody owns me
I'm a free man living in a free country

No, no, no, baby, you don't own me
If you think you do, you're sadly mistaken
I do what I wish and I go where I like, I'm free

I live the life I love
And I love the life that I live
I do the things I wish
And you ain't gonna stop me

Whoa, I'm free, nobody now owns me
Yes, I'm free, nobody owns me
I'm a free man living in a free country

No, no, no, baby, you don't own me
If you think you do, you're sadly mistaken
I do what I wish and I go where I like, I'm free
