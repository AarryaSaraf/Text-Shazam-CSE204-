I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

Evening comes, sun sinks low
Shadows tell that it's time to go
Mystic smiles on faces wild
Comic styles but their faces don't glow

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

Wandering child, searching for directions
That images don't show
It's a sin, beckoning, for the love that they need to know

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
There was no love, no, no love to be found
There was no love, no, no love to be found

I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
I walk the lonely streets, I walk the lonely streets
