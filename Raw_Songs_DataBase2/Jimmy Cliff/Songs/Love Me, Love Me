Love me, love me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love me, love me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Love me and let's come together
And be as one
Love me like brothers and sisters
And we'll be strong

And between you and me we'll find perfect peace
As we learn to live as one family
We'll chase jealousy with sweet harmony
And find it, my love, for eternity

Love me, love me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love me, love me, 'cause I love you too
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Love me and let's walk together
In love and life
Love me and let's get together
And make things right

And between you and me we'll find perfect peace
As we learn to live as one family
We'll chase jealousy with sweet harmony
And find it, my love, for eternity

Love me, love me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Love me, love me, 'cause I love you, honey
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do no fear, honey, do not fear
