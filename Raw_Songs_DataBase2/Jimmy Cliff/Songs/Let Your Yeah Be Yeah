You keep telling me yes 
But you don't mean it 
You keep telling me no 
And try to lean it 

You're giving me buts and maybe 
You know this will drive me crazy 
Why can't you tell it like it is? 

And let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 

Because I'm on my guard and 
I'm watching you from head to toe 
So that let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no 

You wear a plastic smile 
I know by your eyes 
You speak with indefinite style 
You're telling me lies 

You've got to face reality 
What is wrong with you and me? 
Why can't you free your honesty? 

And let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 

Because I'm on my guard and 
I'm watching you from head to toe 
So you better let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no 

You keep telling me yes 
But you don't mean it 
You keep telling me no 
And try to lean it 

You're giving me buts and maybe 
You know this will drive me crazy 
Why can't you tell it like it is? 

You better let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now
