Da-da-dai-dai, da-da-dai, da-da-dai ....
Suffering in the land

It is plain to see we're in a terrible situation
Sufferin' in the land
Nearly half of the world on the verge of starvation
Sufferin' in the land
And the children are crying for more education
Sufferin' in the land
Let's singin'

Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer
Sufferin' in the land
Everything's gettin' higher and the time gettin' tougher
Sufferin' in the land
They're making guns and bombs to set the world on fire
Sufferin' in the land
I'm singin'

Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land, Lord
Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land
