She says she loves me more than I do
And she says she's sorry
She promised me everything too
She tells me not to worry

But listen baby, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose
Listen baby, we got to find out
Which one of us you will choose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

She says she loves the way I smile
With lovely accent when I talk
She says she loves the reggae nights
The way I dance when I walk

But listen babe, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose
Listen babe, we got to find out
Which one of us you will choose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

Yan or Jimmy, Yan or Jimmy
I don't who to choose
Yan or Jimmy, Yan or Jimmy
Which one I'm gonna lose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life
