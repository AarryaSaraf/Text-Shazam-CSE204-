Well you got your funk on funky Broadway
And you got the blues on your Basin Street
And you got the rock on Electric Avenue
Where I want to take you is something new
See the people dressed in red, gold and green
And strictly lion control the scene
You can get sugar cane and coconut water
Well you know it's good for youth, man and daughter

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, groovin' to the reggae beat

Here some people dress in foreign clothes
How they got here, heaven knows
Some do the breakdance on the corner
Tell you man it's hot, hot, hot, hot on ya'

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, jam to the reggae beat

Come along, I'll take you there
I don't care what kind of clothes you wear
Eh, just a come on clean
Come along, come along

Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin' on reggae street
Wooh, oh, oh, oh, rockin to the reggae beat

On reggae street
