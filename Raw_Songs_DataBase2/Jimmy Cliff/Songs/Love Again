Love, love again, brother man
Love, love again, sister woman
Love, love again, little ones

I know you might think it's outdated
But it never can be duplicated
Many times seems complicated
But it never can be duplicated
Sing it out and it's music
Sound so sweet, you got to repeat it

Love, love again, brother man
Say love, love again, sister woman
Say, say, love, love again, little ones

As pure as it came through the ages
Given to man in its stages
For the unity of humanity
In a this time of vanity
Say it out and it's miracle
Feel so sweet you got to repeat it

Love, love again, brotherman
Love, love again, little ones
Now you see where I'm coming from

So now that we see what I'm saying
And now that you know that it's true
And now that the action's been taken
And all the walls have been shaken, shaken down

Say love, love again, brother man
Love, love again, sister woman
Love, love again, little ones
Say it confidently, passionately, universally

Love, love again, brother man
Love, love again, sister woman
Love, love again, little ones
Chant it out now

Love, love, again
Love, love, again
