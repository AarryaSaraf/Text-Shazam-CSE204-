Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,

Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,

Trials and crosses in our way,
Pretty soon they'll have to fade away..
With a little dedication and sweet devotion, oh yeah,
Cause it's alright, so hold tight,
Yes it's alright, so hold tight,
Hold tight, alright

Love is a Mans solution,
Loving is a Woman's solution,
Spread it over every Nation,
Tell it to the Young generation,
Love is a Boy's solution,
And loving is a Girl's solution,

Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,

I was born as a Man from a Woman,
and a Woman was made for a Man,
So put your little hands in mine,
There's no Hills or Mountains we can't climb,
So it's alright just hold tight,
Yes it's alright just hold tight,
Hold tight alright.....

Love is a Mans solution,
Loving is a Woman's solution,
Spread it all over the world,
Tell it to every Boy and Girl,
Love is a Boy's solution,
And loving is a Girl's solution,

Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,

And so as it revolves,
There's no problem we can't solve,
Put your little hands in mine and we'll fly, we'll fly..

Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,
Oh yeah, Love Solution,
Oh no, Love Solution,

Spread it all over the World
Tell it to every Boy & Girl...

Spread it...
Tell it...
Spread it...
All over the World...

Spread it...
Tell it...
