Do you have a dear mother
Kind, devoted and true
Dear mother I'm sending to you
Best wishes and all the day through
May your days be cloudless and clear
Bringing to you true happiness
Each day and night of the year

She's my mother
And I love her so
More than any other
Anywhere I go

Do you have a dear mother
Kind, devoted and true
Dear mother may all that is fair
Come to you right through the year
While I was a child you were my god
You were always dear to me and always were by my side

She's my mother
And I love her so, yes I do
More than any other
Anywhere I go
Do you have a dear mother

So devoted and true
Dear mother I'm sending to you
Best wishes and all the day through
May your days be cloudless and clear
Bringing to you true happiness each day and night of the year

She's my mother
And I love her so, yes I do
More than any other
Anywhere I go, talking 'bout my mother
She's my mother
And I love her so
More than any other, woman in this world
Anywhere I go
She's my mother
