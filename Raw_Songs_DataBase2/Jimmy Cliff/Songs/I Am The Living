I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a giver, I'm a taker
I'm a liver and a miracle maker

At last, it has come to pass
I know if you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the meek, I'm the strong
I'm the right and the wrong

At last, it has come to pass
I know you'll flow when you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a stranger, I'm a friend
The beginning and the ending

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the thirst and the hunger
I'm the oldest, getting younger

At last, it has come to pass
Living in the nature, it is greater yeah

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the pain and the passion
I'm the essence, satisfaction

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
