Say, say, say
Do, do, do
Say, say, say
Do, do, do

Wanting, needing
Saying, praying
Dreaming, hoping
Waiting, playing

Won't get you what you want
If you keep saying you can't
Won't get you what you need
Really in words and deeds

You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done

Thinking, planning
Wishing, longing
Crying, lying
Hesitating, procrastinating

Won't bring you sweet success
Won't bring you happiness
Won't bring you sweet caress
Won't bring you reprogress

You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done

Not enough to say, say, say
You got to do, do, do
It's not enough to say, say, say
Here's what you do, do, do

Not enough to say, say, say
It's all you do, do, do
Not enough to say, say, say
You've got to do, do, do

I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
