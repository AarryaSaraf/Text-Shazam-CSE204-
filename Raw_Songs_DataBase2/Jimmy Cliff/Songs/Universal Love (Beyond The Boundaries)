Yea, beyond the boundaries, the boundaries of your mind
Aah, beyond the boundaries

Beyond your individual boundary
Beyond the family boundaries
Go beyond your tribal boundaries
And beyond the social boundaries
Yes, beyond the national boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Go beyond your religious boundaries
And beyond the political boundaries
Yes, beyond the commercial boundaries
And beyond the sexual boundaries
Yes, beyond the national boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Go beyond your religious boundaries
And beyond the political boundaries
Yes, beyond the commercial boundaries
And beyond the sexual boundaries
Yes, beyond the racial boundaries
Universal love, universal love

We don't need no new religion
We don't need no other Saviour
What we need is to understand
Our fellow man and our behaviour
To live in love and unity
Universally, universal love

Within your family boundaries
And within your tribal boundaries
And within your political boundaries
Yes, within your religious boundaries
Universal love, universal love

Universal love
I hear some people say love is just a four-letter word today
There's a question I like to ask:
Where would you be without love?
Love is why you're here
Love is why you came here
Universal love
