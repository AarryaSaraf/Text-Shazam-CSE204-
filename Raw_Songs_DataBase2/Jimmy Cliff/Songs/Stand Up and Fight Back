Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

Oneness is a reality
Suppressed by evil mentality
Your heart yearns for love
And your mind cries for peace and happiness

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

Ever since generations, they been saying it will change
It will change, it will change, it will change, it will change
But it never seems to change
No matter how high the price you pay
They're gonna say you're wrong any way
People like a malignant cancer
Oh how they shun the truth

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose

No matter what the people say
Never, never, never run away
You're the youth, you're the change, you're the new
You're the one to free yourself

Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
Stand up and fight back
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
You got nothing to lose
To lose, to lose, to lose, to lose
