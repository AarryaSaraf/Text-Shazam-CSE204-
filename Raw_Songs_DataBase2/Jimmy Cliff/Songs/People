There comes a time when we must fight again
For what we know to be the truth
here comes the day when we must rise again
To save ourselves reclaim our youth

So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world

There comes a time to gather round again
To sit and learn each others ways
As of today lets start to laugh again
And hope and Joy is here to stay

And people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
People lets get together and show our power
All over the world

Love sees the way to make the best of things
We know the truth lies in the simple things
The simple thing lest we forget

So people lets get together and show our power
All over the world
People lets get together and show our power
All over the world
