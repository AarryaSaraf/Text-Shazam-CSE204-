No man is an island Jack
You could be tougher than a rock
One and one's got to make contact 
To get on the right track yeah

And for all the good things that you're wishing 
There's a place you can go where the vibes are nice just like paradise
Sweet paradise, sweet paradise, club paradise, sweet paradise

Island Jack said he ain't going back to the USA
Just rub that coconut oil on his back
Said he's here to stay
Cuz he's found in his life what's been missing
And for all the good things he's been wishing
Said you'll find me where the vibes are nice and the price is right
Club paradise, sweet paradise, club paradise, sweet paradise whoa yeah whoa yeah

No man is an island Jack
You could be harder than a rock
Ones and ones got to make contact 
To get on the right track
When you see in your life something missing
And for all the good things that you're wishing
