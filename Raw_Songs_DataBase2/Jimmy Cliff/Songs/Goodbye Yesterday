Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

Good to see you here, how you doin'?
Grab a chair, I'd like you here to stay
Got a dream onto I've been brewin'
Dreams that saw me through a rainy day

So goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

I took all I could beg or borrow
Mammy would see, I'd give it back some day
I put my money on a new tomorrow
And my gamble hasn't been in vain

So goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

I've got plans that's been made to measure
Things I know are gonna see through well
Come on happy, babe, let's get together
Do our thing and then go to hell

So goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I know every thing's gonna be fine

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today
I've been waiting for a long, long time
