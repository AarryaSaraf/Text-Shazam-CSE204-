I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know

I hurt you and I want you to forgive me
I know I hurt you and I want you to forgive me
'Cause I'm sorry and I want you to know

I walk straight in your life and then I walk it back
I can imagine how you feel
And I want you to know how I feel too

That I'm sorry, baby, I said, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know
No, man!

I walk straight in your life and then I walk it back
I can imagine how you feel
And I want you to know how I feel too

That I'm sorry, baby, I said, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know
Please forgive me, please
