We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints once again

There will be no compromise
There'll be no stones left unturned
And let love and honesty abide
We'll trace the footprints once again

When something's lost, then something is gained
If there was no sun, there would be no need for rain
Things will grow old, for the new to begin
There is no mystery, that cannot be explained
And the river flows to the sea
And the world keeps spinning around
Not even the Jordan River can keep us from the shore

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll dig deep down in the sand
Till we find the rock on which we stand

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time
