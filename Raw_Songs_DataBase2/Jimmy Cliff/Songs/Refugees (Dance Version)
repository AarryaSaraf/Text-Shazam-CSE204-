We got a big box at home
Ref, ref, ref, ref...

I'm a refugee

There was na exodus from Europe to America
Now there's an exodus from the Middle East to Europe
Yes, there's an exodus from Africa to Europe
People running here and there, looking for a home

Well, couldn't they be someone like you and me?
You know I'm a global citizen in this forum

Listen, I'm a full G that's a refugee
My family paddled through the seas
Made it through day but the night is calling
Load on they back like when camels walking
We gon' make it through the odds
Every day that we live is blessing in disguise
Do unto others as you would have done it to you
Listen, that's just the word from the wise
We live for the fate but we die 
'Cause the proof only show that you care about you
About us, if you really do give us this time
We got women and children at the border line
