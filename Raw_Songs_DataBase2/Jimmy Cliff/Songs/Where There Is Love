Where there is love, there is no war
No superstar, no police car
Where there is love, it's only right
To walk in light through the darkest night

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there's love, love, love, I'll be there

Where there is love, oh life's a gloom
But maybe it's grown, like we all know
Where there is love, there's harmony
And unity comes naturally

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there's love, love, love, I'll be there

Love suffereth long and is strong - can't go wrong
Love, envy not and is kind
What's yours is mine

Where there is love, you understand
Your brethren man, giving away
Where there is love, there's no confusion
Only solutions, illusions

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there is love

Where there is love...
