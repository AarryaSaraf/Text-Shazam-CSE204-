You're the only one

You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one

Oh I've seen
Lots of real fine dancers
Ones who can move you on the floor
Oh they talk
But they have no answers
When it gets right down to the core

Baby, you're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in

Oh I've been to historic places
Showered with their charms and their graces
When it comes down to being me
Just me
Just happy
Just free

Baby, you're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in

(Hmm mmm mmm, mamamama
Hmm mmm mmm, yeah)

Yeah
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in

You're the only, only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
You're the only one
To believe in
Yes you are

You're the only, only one
Whom I can trust
Only one, only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust, yeah
You're the only one
To believe in
