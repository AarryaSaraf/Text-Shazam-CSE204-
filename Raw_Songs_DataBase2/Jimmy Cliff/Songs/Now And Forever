Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, where you belong
Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, you're number one

Now and forever, once and for all
You and I, we will get by
Now and forever, once and for all
You and I need not be shy

For what is life, it's what we make of it
Everyone has a place to fit
So blaze a new trail from a tale that's old
Sing a new song that's yet unfold, untold

Now and forever, once and for all
Work your plan, it's all in your hands
Now and forever, once and for all
Work your plan, you're number one

Yes what is life, it's what we make of it
Everyone has their place to fit
It's for us to dare, for us to win
Through laughter and tears, through thick and thin, you win

Now and forever, once and for all
Love is here, so make it clear
Now and forever, once and for all
Love is here, so have no fear

Now and forever, now and forever, you and I
Now and forever, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now and forever, you and I, you and I

Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, live up youth one, you're number one
Now and forever, once and for all
Take your stand, live up youth one, you're number one

Now and forever, once and for all
Make your plan, live up youth one, you're number one
Now and forever, once and for all...
