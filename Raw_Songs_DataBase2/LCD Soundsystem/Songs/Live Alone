I wanna live alone
Because the greatest love is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
I wanna live alone
I could be happy on my own
Spend test of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

So I'm gonna live alone
I'm not saying that our love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Wanna stay in love with you

So I'm gonna live alone
Yeah, I'll be happy on my own
For the rest of a life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

In New York City
When I get in the taxi
I said, "man" to driver
He said, "man,"
"Oh, I can imagine having drink with that guy"

He's alright
Oh, he's alright
He's alright
Yeah, he's alright
He's alright

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

I want to live alone
So I'll never be alone
