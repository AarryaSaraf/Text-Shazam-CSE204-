I caught your eye when I stepped outside with my emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood

The look of grave concern in your eyes and your surprise at my emotional haircut
It's better to me
It's much better than it used to be

'Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV

You wish that you'd been told about whatever has led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please

And treat yourself tonight
To a little love life

Now we all get ideas and then shut-shut 'em down with an emotional haircut
No I ain't Dionysian, man

Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat

So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We're gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass

Man, you're in love with the bodies in here and your emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat

You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can't delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of your dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can't sleep
I know you can't calm down

Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of it
Out to

Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen; it's calming down
