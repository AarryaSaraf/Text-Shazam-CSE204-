My soul is weak
my eyes are blind
the fire that drove me on
is nothing more than dust and ash
the day my friend was gone

Now we got his name on a rock again
this time it's the last

party is over fire

so put your hand in my hand
and maybe we'll forget
that life had even started
before the day we met

my rotten bones full of holes
skin just holds 'em in
might look like I'm damaged
but the damage is deep within

so put your hand in my hand
and maybe we'll forget
that life had even started
before the day we met
