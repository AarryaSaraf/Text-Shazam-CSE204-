Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time,
Don't Go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't Go
Love the it when you lie
Stay with me, hold me all of the time
Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time,
Don't Go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't Go
Love it when you lie
Stay with me, hold me all of the time
Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, I love it when you're mine
Don't go
Love it when you smile
Stay with me, love it when you're mine
Don't go
I love you you're so fine
