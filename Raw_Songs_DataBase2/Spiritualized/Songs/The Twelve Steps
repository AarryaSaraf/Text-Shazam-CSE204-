If you got the money for a rehab cure
You ain't got a problem you can't afford
I was very nearly clean you know
Cos I only had twelve steps to go

The only time I'm drink and drug free
Is when I don't have to pay for what I need
That's rare indeed

If your willpower's weak temptation's strong
Lord knows how we're going to get along
But the worst thing about your kind of disease
is you know who can charge whatever she pleases?
It's 28 days for 13 grand
Better go get myself and insurance plan
She's my man?

I ain't got to where I'm going to
by hanging round with people like you
But then again I ain't never got
anywhere I wanted to get to

I ain't got to where I'm going to
by hanging round with people ain't my friends
But then again I ain't never got
anywhere I wanted in the end

If you got the money for me how come
You ain't got a problem you can't afford
I was very nearly clean you know
Cos I only had twelve steps to go

The only time I'm drink and drug free
Is when I get my drugs and drink for free
That's the mean

If your willpower's weak temptation's strong
Lord knows how we're going to get along
And I don't think I'm gonna find Jesus Christ
So I'd rather spend my cash on vice

28 days for 13 grand
Better go get myself an insurance plan
She's my man

Do some knitting, get some rest
Group therapy gets me depressed
You might get banned if you relapse,
We'll take you back when you got some cash

You're just as likely to find inner peace
by buying your stuff from off the street, 
come on, come on
