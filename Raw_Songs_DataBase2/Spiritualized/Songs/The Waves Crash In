The waves crash in
And the waves crash out
The wind blows the air
And my thoughts fly about
And I know i would call you
If ever I could
But the wind takes its toll
On the soul in my blood
And I know I would die
If I ever should leave you alone

The moon comes comes up
And the stars above
The tide holds its sway 
On the ache in my blood
And could I have loved you
A little bit more
But I know that i tried
Like I never before
And I know i would die
If I ever should leave you alone

Don't let me stop you
You gotta find out
