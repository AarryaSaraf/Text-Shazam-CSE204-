Please Lord, may I be wrong
'Cause when men are right, they are not young
Please Lord, may I be foolish
'Cause when men are wise, they're not satisfied
Please Lord, may I be lonely
'Cause when men are not, they're reckless, you know
Please Lord, may I be a liar
When men tell the truth, they're on their own

And I haven't got a clue
And nor has anyone I know
Trying to forget
All the things that haven't happened yet

Please Lord, may I be wrong
'Cause when men are right, they are not young
Please Lord, may I be foolish
'Cause when men are wise, they're not satisfied
Please Lord, may I be helpless
'Cause when men are strong, they're dangerous, you know
And please Lord, put a tiny little spring in my step

Well I got it right now this time I'm going down, going down slow
Well I got it right now this time I'm going down slow
(Please Lord, may I be wrong)
Well I got it right now this time I'm going down, going down slow
('Cause when men are right, they are not young)
Well I got it right now this time I'm going down slow
(Please Lord, may I be foolish)
Well I got it right now this time I'm going down, going down slow
('Cause when men are wise, they're not satisfied)
Going down slow
(Please Lord, may I be lonely)
('Cause when men are not, they're reckless, you know)
Going down slow
(Please Lord, may I be a liar)
Going down slow
(When men tell the truth, they're all alone)
