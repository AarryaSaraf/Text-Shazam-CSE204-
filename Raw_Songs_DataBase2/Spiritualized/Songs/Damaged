And I
Wanna just close my eyes
Feel like I'm living
Feel like I'm alive
Wrapped up in clover
And I'm safe from the tide
Feel like I'm floating
And I'm laid out in time
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged
Over you

And I
Wanna just close my mind
Feel like I'm floating
On ship out of time
Wrapped up and golden
Cos I made up my mind
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm broken
Over you

And I
Wanna just take my time
Feel like I'm broken
And I'm laid out and dying
Wasted and stolen
Quell the cavalier child
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged
Over you
