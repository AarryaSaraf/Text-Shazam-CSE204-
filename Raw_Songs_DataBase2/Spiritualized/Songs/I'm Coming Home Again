Maybe Faith has lost her faith again
She'd been betting on the race again
Will not see her on her way around, gonna pack that all up and fool around
Then I'm gonna take it up, baby, or leave it
I'm coming home again

I've been there and I've been back again
Gonna dull it with lorazepam
Kind've had it with philosophy, 'cause I'm thinking I am but I'm failing to be
Let it fall, take it quiet, backslide and I'm gone again

Mary Mary got a four leaf flower
Said her mind is like a Babel Tower
Said she timed it to a factor three
And this life is scaring the life out of me
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Said she read it on a railroad sign
Said we're drinking till the well runs dry
Said she had it written out in the stars
Said the whole of her life was a mess and a scar
Gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Mary Mary got a four leaf flower
Said her mind is like a Babel Tower
Said she timed it to a factor three
But you don't need to know what you don't even see
Gotta take it up, baby, or leave it
I'm coming home again

'Fraid Faith has lost her faith again
She'd been betting on the race again
Said her world is spinning round and round
But you can't make it up there for falling down
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Happiness is not a guarantee
'Cause all your problems are looking good to me
Got a dried-up bed of sympathy
And you cannot be bound if you cannot be free
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Gonna count down ten and I'm out
Gonna count down ten and I'm out
Gonna bend that wire and twist and shout
Gonna holler till they let me out
Gonna take it all, baby, or leave it
'Cause I'm coming home again

Hosanna! Head on high
I'm gonna sing it till the day I die
Ain't gonna wait around and sympathise
Gonna push on the gas, till the gas runs dry
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again

Mary dances on a hurricane
Said the boys in here are all the same
Will not see her on her way around
'Cause she'd rather be preaching with fools around
And I'm gonna lay it all out
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
I'm coming home again
