If you feel lonely
and the world's against you
take the long way home
past the scary Jesus
and you'll find
my door with your name in diamonds
and you'll feel lonely
no more

Help me lord help me Jesus
'Cause I'm lonely and tired
Help me lord it ain't easy
'Cause I'm living with the blind
I got no reason to believe in anything

Help me lord help Jesus
'Cause I'm hurting inside
Help me lord it ain't easy
'Cause I'm living a lie
and god I'm hoping for a reason to be here

Help me lord help me father
'Cause I'm losing my mind
Help me lord its getting harder
'Cause I'm losing all the time
I got no reason to believe in anymore

Help me lord help me father
'Cause I wasted all my time
Help me lord it's getting harder
'Cause I've made a mess of mine
and god I'm hoping for the reason to be clear

So long you pretty thing
save your little soul
The music that you played so hard
on your radio
All your dreams and diamond rings
and all that rock and roll can bring you
So long, so long
