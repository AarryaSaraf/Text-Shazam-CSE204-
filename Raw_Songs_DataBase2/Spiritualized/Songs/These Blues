If I'm ever gonna kick these blues
Then I'm gonna have to give up some of these things
Lord you know I may be wrong
But something deep down inside my soul still turns me on

If I'm ever gonna see the light
Then I'm gonna have to reach so high
Lord you know I may be wrong
But something way down inside my soul still turns me on
