Hush, keep your voices down
Everyone is asleep uptown
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices down
Everyone is asleep uptown
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices clear
There's a change in the air 'round here
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go take the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go tell the city tonight

Hush, keep your voices clear
There's a change in the air 'round here
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go take the city tonight
Sweet heart, sweet light
Oh babe, it's a beautiful night
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go tell the city tonight

Hush

I caught you once
And I'll court you again
I only wanted to be your friend
And I wanted to know if you wanted to go to the city again
