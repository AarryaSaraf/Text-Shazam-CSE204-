I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd part the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you
I'd take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd catch the wind and have it blow all my kisses to you
Take the birds and teach them all the words of every love song I know
And I'd have them fly around and sing them all to you

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you today
My mind is a mess and I'm needing you less
Give me your call in a little while

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm just dreaming of you
There ain't a man around can knock me off my cloud 'cause "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see this week
Lately I've found I don't need you around
Don't think it's working out anyway
Anyway I'd like

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause you're the only girl I ever met who's honest and true
I'd like to settle down with you and mess around a house on the hill
And I'm sitting here and hoping it'll all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see this fall
My phone has been broke and I thought that we'd spoke
Don't think it's working out anyway
Anyway

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you this year
I hate to confess and I've changed my address
I haven't been home in a little while
Little while

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you again
I met someone else, you should do it yourself
So darling please don't call
Please don't call
