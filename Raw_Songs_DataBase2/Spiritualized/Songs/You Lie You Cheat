You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down you'll see
You made too many enemies

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down to see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

There ain't nothin' I can do
You got your parents' attitude
There ain't nothin' more to say
Gonna cut you deep and make it quick

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down to see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

Ain't no better way
