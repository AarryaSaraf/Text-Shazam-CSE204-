Baby I'm sitting on fire
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

Baby you know that I love you
But a memory still haunts at my door
When we're together we stand so tall
But a part of me still falls to the floor

Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life

Baby I'm sitting on fire
But the flames put a hole in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
And in my own time I am losing fast
I can even hold what I own

Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life

[Instrumental]

So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
In my own time I am dying
Can't even hold what I own
