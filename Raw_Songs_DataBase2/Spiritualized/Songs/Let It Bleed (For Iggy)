I laboured over these words too long
They're nothing to behold
I wanted it to be special for you
But it's just a song
I wanted it to lay close to your heart and say
"Darling, I was wrong"

I wanted it to say something so special and true
I wanted it to cut deeper and darker for you
I wanted it to show wisdom where honesty's due
Open up and bleed

I laboured over this life too long
There's nothing to behold
I wanted it to be better for you
A minute down the road
I wanted it to go straight to your heart and say
"Darling, I was wrong"

I wanted it to say something so special and true
I wanted it to cut deeper and darker for you
I wanted it to show reason where honesty's due
Open up and bleed
Open up and bleed

Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed

Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down and let it bleed
Come on, come on, come on and
Lay it down, lay it down...
