Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, but it's all right
And don't look down, there's better things for you and I
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, till morning light, you'll be okay
And don't look down, there's better things another day
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, well bless your soul
And don't look down, there's better things that you will know
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart
