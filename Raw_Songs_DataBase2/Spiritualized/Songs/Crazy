I didn't think it could happen again
Love just fell out of the blue
And it keeps on knocking, we can't let it in
I'm falling in love like a fool

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

And I know you can't love me now, not today
All of my thoughts are of you
But I hope in time that we might find a way
Lord knows how time can be cruel

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

Darling, I need you to tell me to stay
Say that you won't let me go
Darling, I want you but there's just no way

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you

Darling, I'm sorry, I must make amends
For messing around with you
We've all heard the story, we know how it ends
Darling, I wish it weren't true

Crazy for living
Crazy it's true
Crazy I'm out of my mind
My mind's all messed up over you
