// Sweet Talk //

Well, you sweet talk like an angel
But you're driving this blind
But don't you sweet talk like an angel tonight?
Well, you sweet talk like an angel
With a heart full of lies
But don't you sweet talk like an angel tonight?
And you talk like your mother and your father
But you just close your eyes
You don't care who you're messing around
This time
I can't take care of my baby
I can't take care of mine
'cause no God given war in this world's
about lifeâ€¦
And you say "Where do you stand on the war?"
Well you stand right where you stood before
As far from the bullets and bombs
As they fall
And you stand there and fight for it all
But you don't own a gun
And when the shells start to fall all around
You don't have to run
And you sweet talk like an angel
But you're driving this blind
Don't you sweet talk like an angel tonight
But don't you sweet talk like an angel tonight?

// Death Take Your Fiddle //

I think I'll drink myself into a coma
And I'll take every way out I can find
But morphine, codeine, whisky, they won't alter
The way I feel the way now death is not around

So death take your fiddle
And play a song for me
Play a song we used to sing
The one that brought you close to me
Play a song and I will sing along

I think I'd like to take myself to heaven
Cause I ain't been there many times before
And Jesus Christ, if I don't know if I like it
Sadness struck a thousand times or more

So death take your fiddle
And play a song for me
Play a song we used to sing
The one that brought you close to me
Play a song and I will sing along

Think I'll drink myself into a coma
And I'll take every pill that I can find
But morphine, codeine, whisky, they won't alter
The way I feel now death is not around
The way I feel now death is not around
The way I feel now death is not around

// I Gotta Fire //

Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta fire to call my own
Freedom's mine to hold
Gotta fire and bide my time
Praise the Lord and I'll find out
Hold on and blow my mind
Freedom's one more fight
3000 miles from home
Gotta a gun to call my own
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire, Lord I got a fire now
Gotta letter from my home
Didn't know my mind was blown
Gotta get the feelin' back
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire now
Gotta light inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta cause to call my own
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire
Freedom's lost its [?]
Ain't got no love in here
Gotta job [?]
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now
Sometimes you know it ain't right
Get the car to get it right
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now
Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Aint no religon here
Gotta fire Lord i got a fire

// Soul On Fire //

You were born on a black day
Shot through with starlight
And all the angels singing
Just about got it right

Cut through the silver
And goodness did heaven know
I don't know where we're going
But darling bless your soul

Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.

Sweetheart, may not be easy
But we're trying hard to hold on
Trying to make it better
Sweetheart, got so much freedom
But freedom is just another word
When you've no-one left to hurt.
and i said

Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.

Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.

I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever.

I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.

// Sitting On Fire //

Baby I'm sitting on fire
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

Baby you know that I love you
But a memory still haunts at my door
When we're together we stand so tall
But a part of me still falls to the floor

Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life

Baby I'm sitting on fire
But the flames put a hole in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
And in my own time I am losing fast
I can even hold what I own

Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life

[Instrumental]

So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
In my own time I am dying
Can't even hold what I own

// Yeah Yeah //

Hey babe gonna make you mine
Been mine since the day I arrived
Ain't gonna let it go that way
Gonna make you mine and make my day
I said yeah yeah gonna take it all
Have faith and yet to fall
Gonna gather mine right by my side
[?]
Gotta lay it on, alone we die
what a waste of precious time
I swear my mind ain't round oh yeah
I wanna know how long we're here
I don't know but I'll make a guess
'Bout a life away from death
I ain't so over qualified I'm out of here a long time
Yeah get it on
yeah yeah get it on
It's so undignified I'm out of here a long time
Yeah Yeah

// You Lie You Cheat //

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down you'll see
You made too many enemies

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down to see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

There ain't nothin' I can do
You got your parents' attitude
There ain't nothin' more to say
Gonna cut you deep and make it quick

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down to see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

Ain't no better way

// Baby I'm Just A Fool //

Baby I''m just a fool, tearing all my heart out just for you
It gets so hard to do, I''m cold and cored and fried and juiced like you
Oh hey, my mama said "Now, come on let's head it out of here"
Heaven, it ain''t easy, you know I got the scars to say I'm here

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it show
You're so fucking self-assured, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nowhere you have been that I need to go
There ain''t nothing you can learn that I need to know

Baby I''m just a man, but I''ve got the dreams of gods and kings
Well I can't hold my thoughts, my mind is full of a thousand different things
I get some blood inside and I can't even see the stuff, it's clear
Hell, it should be easy but I''ve got the heart of men of fear

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it go
So fucking weird inside, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nothing that you can teach me that I need to know
There ain''t nothing you can give me that I need to own

Baby I''m just a fool, tearing all my heart out just for you
It gets so hard to do, I'm cold and cored and fried and juiced like you
Oh hey, my mama said "Now, come on let's head it out of here"
Heaven, it ain''t easy, you know I got the scars to say I'm here

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it show
You're so fucking self-assured, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nowhere you have been that I need to go
There ain''t nothing you can learn that I need to know

// Don't Hold Me Close //

Don't hold me close
You're not the one
that I can most
rely upon
But I'll be here
when you are done
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you

Don't touch me there
your fire's too bright
and I don't care
to travel light
But I'll be here
when you are through
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you

And in the night
I'll dream of you
and hope my aim
is straight and true
But I'll be here
when you are through
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you

// The Waves Crash In //

The waves crash in
And the waves crash out
The wind blows the air
And my thoughts fly about
And I know i would call you
If ever I could
But the wind takes its toll
On the soul in my blood
And I know I would die
If I ever should leave you alone

The moon comes comes up
And the stars above
The tide holds its sway 
On the ache in my blood
And could I have loved you
A little bit more
But I know that i tried
Like I never before
And I know i would die
If I ever should leave you alone

Don't let me stop you
You gotta find out

// Borrowed Your Gun //

Daddy I'm sorry I borrowed your gun again
Shot up your family and shot for the city
Daddy I'm sorry I borrowed your gun again
Shot up my mother, my beautiful mother

Hold out your hands, I'm coming home
Hold out your arms, I'm all alone
My mind is made up and I'm down on my luck
I've run out of bullets again

Daddy I'm sorry I borrowed your gun again
Shot up your family and shot for the city
Daddy I'm sorry I borrowed your gun again
Shot up my mother, my beautiful mother

Hold out your hands, I'm coming home
Hold out your arms, I'm all alone
My mind is made up and I'm down on my luck
I've run out of bullets again

Hold out your hands, I'm coming home
Hold out your arms, I'm all alone
My mind is made up and I'm down on my luck
I've run out of bullets again

Hold out your hands, I'm coming home
Hold out your arms, I'm all alone
My mind is made up and I'm down on my luck
I've run out of bullets again

Hold out your arms, I'm coming home
Hold out your hands, I'm all alone
My mind is made up and it's time to make up
I've run out of bullets again

// Goodnight Goodnight //

Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, but it's all right
And don't look down, there's better things for you and I
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, till morning light, you'll be okay
And don't look down, there's better things another day
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, well bless your soul
And don't look down, there's better things that you will know
I'll hold you close, you'll be all right, till morning comes I'll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you're coming down, sweetheart
