// Medication //

Everyday I wake up
And I take my medication
And I spend the rest of the day
Waiting for it to wear off
Every night I stay up late
And make my state more desperate
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Every now and then
I get an urge to drive around
Get into my car then I'll
Maybe go uptown
Take my medication
Do my best to get it on
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Everytime I say this
I just know this time I mean it
But a feeling deep inside
Says it's okay one more time
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Makes me feel so good
Makes me feel so fine
Makes me feel so good
Leaves me fucked up inside
Medicate my days
Medicate my eyes
Medicate my life
Gonna feel alright
Gonna feel so good
Gonna feel just fine
Don't feel so good
Don't feel just fine
Don't feel so good
Leaves me fucked up inside

// The Slide Song //

Hey you know that I've been searching deep inside
And I'm not certain I will like the things I find
I don't know that you will understand but I have tried

I don't know just why I need to do the things I do
And I'd love to do these things without them hurting you
I don't know that you will understand but that's the truth

I'd give it up for you but let me finish what I got
I'd love to now but lord you know it sure does take a lot
I'll always love you honey but I can't be
What I'm not

// All Of My Tears //

Lord it's so hot and I ain't got a lot
Don't need much but I ain't satisfied right now
I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears

Lord it's so hot and my heart's bleeding
Ain't been with you but it's you I'm needing right now

I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears

When your hot and lord how it's steaminh
You gotta go back to the river babe
I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to take me back to my shame

// These Blues //

If I'm ever gonna kick these blues
Then I'm gonna have to give up some of these things
Lord you know I may be wrong
But something deep down inside my soul still turns me on

If I'm ever gonna see the light
Then I'm gonna have to reach so high
Lord you know I may be wrong
But something way down inside my soul still turns me on

// Let It Flow //

Here it comes and then it goes
And that feeling takes me home
And I don't know where I'm goin'
Let it flow
All I wanted was a taste
Just enough to waste the day
Just enough to make me sick
Let it flow

And it takes up all my time
And it lays me back a while
Makes me feel like I'm a child

Let it flow
Let it flow

Here it comes an then it goes
And it hits me, takes me home
I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't know where I've been
But I'd do it all again
All I wanted was a taste
Enough to waste a day
Just enough to make me sick
I can't get too much of it

// Take Good Care Of It //

You got a whole lot of love
Won't you give some to me
If you send some my way
I will take good care of it

For the love that you sind
Will come back to you someday
And the good time you bring
I will bring to you someday

// Lay Back In The Sun //

// Good Times //

Hey babe you know I feel it
Way down to my toes
Hey babe you know I need it
To help let the whole thing flow
Gonna slip right down here
And wait until the sunlight goes
Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let you know what it's all about
For god's sake babe don't lose it
Don't throw it all away
For god's sake you know I love it
I'm gonna do it everyday
Gonna slip right down here
Wait until the sunlight goes

Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let you know what it's all about

Hey babe you know I feel you
Way down to my soul
Hey babe you know I need you
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna sit right down here
Wait until the sunlight warms my soul
Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let the whole world know what it's all about

I think I feel it coming on
I think I feel it coming on now

// Spread Your Wings //

Oh babe
You know I'll take
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
And time
Time goes

Time goes slowly by
When I know that it can fly
C'mon spread your wings
Spread your wings

You can do anything, everything, anything

// Feel Like Goin' Home //

And I, I feel
Feel like, feel like
Feel like I'm gone
Feel like I'm goin' home

Take it down to my soul
Lay it back, feel so good
Summer sun turns me on
Lay me back, feels so good
