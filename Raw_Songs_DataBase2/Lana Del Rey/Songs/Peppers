Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha


Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah


Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie

Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie

I sit upskirt, I don't have much to lose
I got a truck, I take it for a midnight, a midnight drive, yeah
My boyfriend tested positive for COV-, it don't matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have
I can't cry

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah


Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

Song..Where it's like..You know that type of song
Wipeout, wipeout
