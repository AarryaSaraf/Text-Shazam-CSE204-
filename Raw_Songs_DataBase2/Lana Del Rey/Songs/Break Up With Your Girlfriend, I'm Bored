You got me some kind of way (Mm-mm)
Ain't used to feeling this way (Mm-mm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one freaking look at your face (Mm-mm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mm-mm)
I usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinking 'bout it

Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You can hit it in the morning (Morning)
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored

This stuff always happens to me (Mm-mm)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mm-mm)
I'm practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doing to me
You're singing my songs in the streets, yeah
Acting all innocent, please (Yeah, yeah)
When I know you out here thinking 'bout it

Then you realize she's right there
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the morning (Morning)
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend
'Cause I'm bored

Hating if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm tripping if you feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can call me crazy 'cause I want you
When I never even really freaking met you
You can say I'm tripping and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice)

Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the morning (Morning)
Like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
'Cause I'm bored

With your girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend (Girlfriend)
With your girlfriend
