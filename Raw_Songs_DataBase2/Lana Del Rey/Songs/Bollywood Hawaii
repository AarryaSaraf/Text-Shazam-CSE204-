Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving
