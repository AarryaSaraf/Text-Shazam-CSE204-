Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
We'll do it again
(Did it from, did it from loving you)
We'll do it again
In a world at war

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again
