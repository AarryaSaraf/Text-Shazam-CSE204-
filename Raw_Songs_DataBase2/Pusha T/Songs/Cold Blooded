This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
Yeah, it cold blooded
Hit everything in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold blooded, hah


Black child born in the storm
They had to bundle up to stay warm, bodega babies
Strollers in the snow to the candy lady
That sugar made the monsters of the Nineties crazy
Child rebel soldiers of the inner city
They hate me now, tigers next to Nas and Diddy
His momma fell in love with drug-dealin' Diddy
The only star left that was next to Biggie
Little did she know, she was one of four
And little did he know, he was one of eight
Unknown siblings all through middle school
With the same mean mug that was born from hate
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the Nineties crazy
Hide and go seek when their father's lazy
And their mommas only want the early Nineties JAY-Z's


This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
Yeah, it cold blooded
Hit everything in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold blooded, hah


They said his skin wasn't light enough
And his future wasn't bright enough
Little sister don't talk much
'Cause they uncle had the Midas touch
Evil is as evil does
Momma looked away, blamed it on his needle buzz
Sold his food out the freezer when he needed drugs
Beggin' like he Cool J when he needed love
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the Nineties crazy
Broken black homes is the modern slavery
You can't raise a savage and deny the rabies
Woo, bodega babies
Yeah, bodega babies
How loud I got to scream for someone to save me
And now I'm in this cell from everything you made me


This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
