They call me when it's time to do damage
When the quality ain't up to my standards
That McRib falls below average
Replaced by the Country Style Arby's Rib Sandwich (Woo)
Straight out the smokehouse, Texas's my old route
Eight hours to slow cook, keep push for the rollout
The boss with the Smoky Q sauce
The Real Country Style McRib kept lost, yeugh
This doesn't compare to
That replica Rib patty
I'm screaming, "How dare you?"
You know that I'm war ready
Arby's taking taste to the next level
Arby's is the choice when you won't settle
McDonald's, what you selling, mystery meat?
Hop up and go away, what does history teach?
Mickey D's, McRib, you ain't it in the streets
The Real Country Style Rib Sandwich here to compete
Look, straight out the smokehouse
Country Style Arby's Rib Sandwich, what you know about?
We coming straight out the smokehouse
McRib, you just look like a clown
