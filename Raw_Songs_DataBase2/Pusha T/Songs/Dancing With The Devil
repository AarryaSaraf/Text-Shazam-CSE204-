Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)
Gotta charge it to the game
They would stab me in my back every time if I would let 'em
Heart cold, so I went rose gold diamonds on my bezel
Ain't never get mad, just went up another level
Yeah, I've been dancing with the devil


Watch 'em flock when you having your way
They say love get you killed, gotta die anyway
Thugs got feelings too, had to stand in the rain
I'm disguisin' the pain, traumatized from the game
Yeah, elevators going straight to the penthouse, you gon' see the same faces when you comin' down
I put some money to the side for a big house, I told my mama, "I don't never wanna see you frown"
I've been spendin' time alone 'cause these niggas clowns
And these hoes hands out, ain't got shit to give 'em
I do everything they ask, how am I the villain?
Weight was placed on my back, I was forced to lift it
Weight was placed on my back, I was forced to lift it
I still pull 'em in when it's scorchin', nigga
Gotta pray for my soul 'cause it's torture really
Still sippin' drank 'cause my pain runnin' deep


Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)

She hop in every flight, she fuckin' who she want
Take the words out your mouth just before it leave your tongue
Bottega from her purse to her pumps
Heart eyes every first of the month
Sugar daddy, she call me honey bun
Paper cuts, had to mummy-wrap my thumbs
It's no fun when the rabbit got the gun
Hundred carats and my Uzi weighs a ton
Baby, you can't use him when his money flowing fluid
And he's into prostitution
See, I buy Birkins, so my drive-bys worth it
And I'm gon' spend it 'cause I'm not perfect
So share my world and tell me what's these purchases
When you've been the wave and them bricks still surfin' it?
Detroit niggas claimin' turf again
Me and Babyface Ray cookin' work again, gone


Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)
