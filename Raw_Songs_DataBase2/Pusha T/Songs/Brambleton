They're gonna die
Why would I wanna

We was out in Brambleton after Pooh got hit
Club entourage in that new drop six
Ice that'll snag any new hot bitch
Champagne super soaker screamin' who got this
Beach niggas wanted work that they could move out quick
But my Norfolk niggas, they was on some shoot out shit
You and I, we were different like the two got mixed
Buyin' biggies but was ridin on some 2Pac shit
We was both hurt when we see how Q drop bitch
Said we knew the ledge better, we the new plot twist
Who knew your face bein' all across the news outlets
Would mean forever I would never talk to you 'bout shit

Huh

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

You would pay sixteen, I would pay eighteen
When I paid twenty-two, still was a great thing
Laid up countin' a million, we daydream
Till the plug took back his half, that's they change
Who was with you roaming the halls at night pacing
'Cause the feds watching them things that we chasing
Sliding doors just like the van on eighteen
Revolvin' doors on them whores, they playthings
It was much more than foreigns that we were racing
If the past catch your dash, no erasing
Black Rarri, white hood, make it a race thing
Who knew our dynasty would end up a Xinjiang thing

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

It was sad watching dude in Vlad interviews
Really it's 'bout me, he channeled it through you
Had a million answers, didn't have a clue
Why Michael kissed Fredo in Godfather II
Names they concealed, I don't make up shit
This that no witnesses wrapped in duct tape shit
Needed all my niggas just to move your brick
That had me on Brambleton back when Pooh got hit

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

Why would I wanna hold you down
