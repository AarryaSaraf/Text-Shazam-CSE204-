I pray for my enemies
I pray for my friends
I pray for the one who won't betray me again
I pray for the killers
I pray for the saints
Please pray for me now
Cause darling, I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you

Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes
Lightning struck twice on four classics
Self-preservation, we separate ourselves from the plastic
The ankle of my sweat still elastic
Still do gymnastics
If Hov's still forever young, then I'ma somersault backwards through these chapters
Land in the soft white
Cook it till it's off white
They questionin' my score card
Hold it to a torch light
I hid it in the porch light
See I had the foresight
My 911 was pullin' up to matchin' Porsche night
The married drug dealer, even named my son Brixx
He raps what he lives so fuck the nanny gon' sit
It's the grown man in me
Searchin' for the plug, that's the nomad in me
Still the X factor that's the Rohan in me
Reluctantly a role model
They drown in too many gold bottles
Harold Melvin without the blue note
The past ten years, screaming "Uno!"
Then side step back into the duo
The kings of the Pyrex
I'm my brother's keeper, if you listen and you dissect
All I talk is money if you listen to my dialect
Bitch I shot Grindin' in my momma's momma's projects
I'm just being honest with you, how is that for context
You can live forever when the shit you write is timeless
We gon' live forever 'cause the shit we write is timeless

Tell me what I missed
New designer drugs and emotions I don't get
I know hellcats still paddle when I shift
Vietnam, flashbacks, I get triggered by a sniff
Today's top fives only strengthenin' my myth
Build our own Rushmore just from chiselin' a brick
Still fightin' demons, see that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me that's as deep as the abyss, that is no coincidence
When I was in the mix, opened up your nose like I'm cuttin' it with Vicks
Slavin' over stoves like I rub together sticks
Paved another road so my soul would co-exist
But heaven only knows I won't dig another ditch
In a suit and tie like you puttin' on the ritz
Three record deals show me ignorance is bliss
Tryna milk a game that is only 2%
X told you hell is hot, I told you repent
Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith could move mountains so what are you up against
Walk my brother 'round you bitches, I know he pretends
I greet you with the love of God but that don't make us friends
I might whisper in his ear "bury all of them"
Light another tiki torch and carry it again
Back up on my high horse is chariots again
Put the ring back on her finger, marry it again
