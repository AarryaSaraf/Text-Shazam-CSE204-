Ayo, N-I-N-E turn that up


Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws

The greatest rapper of them all response my mirror on the wall
Bitches come work these crystal balls
And see what future they was drawn
It's blood sports to win it all
We kick this bitch like we Jean Claude
I'm only here to get a water, I ain't fallin' 
Trust these rubber bands and see what they expand too
Bitch, up my hunnids
Made the beat blow birthday candles, make a wish
Feel like Marlon Wayan, why you raisin' prices on the brick?
I empathize my life legit and put my niggas in positions
It can't fall apart if I patch it up like Slick Rick
Ten gold chains around my neck, look like a slave's privilege
They act shook, we etch-a-sketch and draw arms and stretch the Benz
Leave the scene with no more drama, sing Amiri's best hits
If I was made to be your karma, you deserve that shit
'Cause I'm an angel to my momma, but to rap is triple-six, yeugh

Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws, ugh
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws

I put my key, you put your key in
Money we'll be seein'
To scrape the fuckin' ceilin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I put my key, you put your key in
Money we'll be seein'
To scrape the fuckin' ceilin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh


Niggas said I died, I was dead to the streets
Fuck 'em, I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach
G-Wagon your Jeep, Nobu on the beach
Never did Philippes, it's PF Chang's to me
Numbers don't lie when you who they came to see
And the wrist don't lie when the watch is made for he
My yellow brick road was twenty-five a key
The road to the riches was always paved for me
Chillin', sittin' on double digit millions
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Life's a bitch, even Rihanna made a billion
All from sellin' powder, made a killin'
Pusha

Ha-ha-ha-ha
