// We Are The Champions //

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime

And bad mistakes‒
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

And I need to go on and on, and on, and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

And I need just go on and on, and on, and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

// Sheer Heart Attack //

Well you're just 17 and all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between our ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothin'

Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-articulate

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like I'm paralysed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-articulate
Just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

// All Dead, All Dead //

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say

So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone
All dead and gone

// Spread Your Wings //

Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy!
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"

So honey

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Come on, honey

Fly with me

// Fight From The Inside //

Hey you boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing?
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you, boy think that you know what you're doing?
You think that out in the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another fool

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

Right down the line
Right down the line

// Get Down, Make Love //

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you're hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind

You blow my head
Make love (make love)
Inside your bed - everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I get a - get down, get down, get down
Make love

(Get down) I can squeeze (make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel (make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)
(Get down) When you take me (make love)
You make love, you make love, you make love (get down), you make love (make love)

You can make everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get high
You wanna come down
Every time I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I wanna get down, get down, get down

Make love, make love, make love, make love

Aah!

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's just too much
Every time I wanna get down, get down get down, make love

// Sleeping On The Sidewalk //

One, two, three

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin'? Are you playin'?
Sure you don't mean me?

Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

(Now I'll tell you what happened)

They took me to a room without a table
They said, "Blow your trumpet into here."
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was
Sleepin' like a princess
Never touched the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't wanna go home
(Have to have some fun. . .)

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
Yeah

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I
Sure do wanna go home
(Yeah)

// Who Needs You //

I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging 'round
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need, who needs you?

Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?

Oh, muchachos
I like it, I like it
Well, I don't need you

How I was pushed around
"Don't let it get you down"
You walked all over me
"But don't you ever give in"
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand

When I met you, you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'til you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naïve you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well, I don't need, who needs you?

// It's Late //

You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame

But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late when I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late. Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late. Even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late. Though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Yes, baby

Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late, but it's driving me so mad
It's late. Yes, I know but don't try to tell me
That it's too late. Save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late. I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryna work it out

I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Tell me

Tryna work it out

Ooh, too late, yeah
Too late, much too late

You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply

If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late, but it's time to set me free
It's late. Ooh, yes, I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late. So, let the fire take our bodies this night
So late. Let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
Oh, it's all too late

Whoa, whoa
It's too late, c'mon
Late too late, oh, yeah
Whoa

// My Melancholy Blues //

Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
Baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew

So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all-time low
So
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood
So now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues

// All Dead, All Dead (Hybrid Version) //

Memories, memories
How long can you stay to haunt my days?
'Twas not for talk of loving
'Twas not for talk at all
So much ado about nothing
Would be her only call

So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through many a fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
Still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
I know my little friend's
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone
All dead and gone
