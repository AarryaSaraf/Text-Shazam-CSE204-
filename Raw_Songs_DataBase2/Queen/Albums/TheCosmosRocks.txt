// Cosmos Rockin' //

What planet is this, hmm?
Let there be rock 'n' roll

It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone
With the music on quiet, I'm flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud, hear it in the street
Then the neighbors start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open, saying, "What's your point?"
Come on in, let's rock this joint

We got the whole house rockin'
We got the whole house rockin'
We got the whole house rockin'
We got the whole house rockin'
We got the whole house rockin'
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll

We dance out of the door, dance into the street
Then all the people are swayin' to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And the people stare and smile and, ow, they get down
Then the policeman says, "Stop this noise!"
But the beat takes over, now he's one of the boys
The beat's taken over, now he's one of the boys
Come on down, let's rock this town

We got the whole town rockin' (Yeah, yeah)
We got the whole town rockin' (Yeah, yeah)
We got the whole town rockin' (Yeah, yeah)
We got the whole town rockin'
We got the whole town rockin'
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll, hey

Let's go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The cosmos rocks

Across seven seas, through the Panama
Now they're rockin' on beaches and they're rockin' in bars
Don't ask me how and don't ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There's a rock 'n' roll fever in every place
Next thing you know they'll be rockin' out in space
Come on down, let's rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me

We got the whole world rockin'
We got the whole world rockin'
We got the whole world rockin' (Yeah, yeah)
We got the whole world rockin'
We got the whole world rockin' (Ooh)
To the mighty mighty mighty power (Ooh, ooh)
We got the cosmos rockin' (What have we got?)
We got the cosmos rockin' (Oh, yeah)
We got the universe rockin' (What have we got?)
We got the cosmos rockin' (Oh, yeah)
We got the cosmos rockin'
To the might power of rock 'n' roll

// Time To Shine //

Hmm, uh
Uh, ah

With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the ground, your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're ever coming down
In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance, too

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine

A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of songs to be sung
Waters of life flowing, soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered, have we forgotten, oh, so much?

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine

Let's awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise

Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine (Whoa, hey)
It's time to shine (Yeah)
Mm, it's time to shine

// Still Burnin' //

Oh, yeah
Yeah

I can't wake in the mornin'
I can't sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just won't sit right
You might say I'm losin' my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I don't want and I don't need
To play the cryin' game
Music lights this flame in me
I won't let it go and it won't let me be
I'm just a happy slave and I, oh, I can't leave it
'Cause I'm still, and I always will be a believer

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Ooh, let me tell you why
We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die

I can't breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everythin' seem to go wrong
You might think I'm playin' around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe that sweet soul magic
Gonna tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go 'round
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I'm still a believer, headin' for the stars

Oh, yeah
I'm still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
Better than every guy
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die

Don't say that you love me
I can't go that road
But don't think for a moment
That my heart went cold
I keep thinkin' about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep, and when I woke
Everythin' had turned around

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
A new day dawnin'
We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Early in the mornin'
Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Better than every guy
We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we're all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll, never die

// Small //

I like to sit here in the sunshine
Trees in the fields are green sublime
Suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?

I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And don't it make you feel small?

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime

I like to sit here in the autumn time
The trees in the fields, they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime, gentle on your mind
Suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone need to find peace sublime
Oh, peace of mind

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh, peace of mind

// Warboys //

They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun
If you can see them coming, baby, better run

Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It's such a pity that they're dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two-by-two
When it all comes down, they know exactly what to do

Here come the, huh, warboys
Here come the warboys (Hmm, warboys, oh)
Warboys, your boys, politicians' toys
Warboys, our boys, make a lot of noise
Warboys, when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul

Ow
Hup, two, three, four

Well, they look so fierce, they're gonna tear out your heart
When they get near we're gonna see what they got
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine
I'll see you in hell some other time

Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys
Here come the warboys
Here come the
War, war (Agh)
Warboys (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talkin' 'bout warboys, warboys
Wow, wow

// We Believe //

I believe there's no evil out there
We didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time for peace
And a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side, we'll win the game
And some of us believe that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight

I believe there's just once chance in this world
To hear our brothers
Yeah, you believe there's a better way
To listen to each other
We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world, the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night
Yeah, we believe
And we believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give
What we need to receive

I believe we need a hero to step boldly
From the shadows, yeah
You believe there must be someone
On the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say, "I'm sorry"
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes, match the intent with the deed

Oh, we believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation
In our time, we believe
We believe there's not a minute
We should be wasting
When the darkness falls
It's too late to fix the crime (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's peace that we need
That's what we believe
(We believe, we believe, we believe, we believe)
(We believe, we believe, we believe, we believe)

Every father, every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah

We believe, we believe there's a song that's worth the singing (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's a song of truth we're bringing (Ooh, ooh)
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone (Ooh, ooh)
We believe, we believe every creature has a being
(We believe) Has a right to respect and feeling
(We believe) To live and breathe and flourish in the sun

Yeah, that's what we believe
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, that's what we believe

// Call Me //

Call me if you need my love (My love, baby)
Call me if you need my love

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

She lives in a luxury apartment
In the heart of town
I live in the country
And my house is tumbling down (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

I met her in her neighborhood (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I was just passing through (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
One look was all it took (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, one look or two (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Call me if you need my love

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

Get myself a wife or two (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
No more of this running around (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Like I used to do

Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby

// Voodoo //

When the moon rises, the dogs will howl
Look out of your window, I'll be on the prowl
I'm not usually a gambling man
But, oh, I just wanna hold up my hands and say

I'm taking a chance on you, love
Whoa, I'm taking a chance on you, love

I'm not superstitious and I don't wear no charm
I don't carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck, please, don't worry me
'Cause when I look into the mirror, here's the future I see

I'm taking a chance on you, love
Whoa, I'm taking a chance on you, love

Place your bets, better yet
Don't forget what I said
Roll the dice, spin the wheel
Always remember, you've got to keep it real

I don't believe in voodoo, black magic was never my style
But I believe that you do, and it won't take much time
To gather the potions that weave your magic spell (Yeah)
The moon on the ocean has a secret to tell

But, anyway, I'm taking a chance on you, love
Whoa, I'm taking a chance on you, love
Whoa, I'm taking a chance on you, love
Ha ha, yeah

// Some Things That Glitter //

Once I loved a butterfly
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why
But I believed what I'd been told
All things that glitter can't be gold, ooh yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all?
Her pride is headed for a fall, ooh yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the sun
Reaching and hoping
We'll find the right one

Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

// C-lebrity //

Ain't got no hope
Got no idea
What to do
Or why I'm here
Wanna get my face
On your TV
I wanna be heard
I want to be seen

Ain't got nothin'
No
Nothing
Nothin' to show
Make me a c-lebrity

I want to be
A face on TV
(I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a c-lebrity

I wanna get my features
In magazines
See this creature on every street
On every screen
Write my life story
Before I'm twenty one
I got to tell the world
They may say I'm dumb but er

Ain't got nothin'
No
Nothing
Nothing to show
Make me a c-lebrity

I want to be
A face on TV
(I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a c-lebrity

I wanna be a star
In a Broadway musical
They're gonna love me
I can't sing or dance at all
Some may say I'm lackadaisical
And if I was real good
I'd stand no chance at all

I want to be
A face on TV
(Yeah I wanna be on your screen)
Then you can see
I'm a c-lebrity
Then you can say
You knew me one day
Then you will see

// Through The Night //

Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me anymore
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get me anywhere

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand, how to love and how to give?
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Can't face it and there's no place I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand, how to love and how to give?
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love, there's nowhere I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

// Say It's Not True //

The harder we play, the faster we fall
When we think that we know it all, we know nothing at all
The letter arrives like a bolt from the blue
So what's left of your lives, all your dreams lost to you

Say it ain't true, say it today
When I open my eyes, will it all go away?
Say it's not true, say it's not real
Can't be happenin' to you, can't be happenin' to me

It's hard not to cry, it's hard to believe
So much heartache and pain, so much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science, all the knowledge we've stored
Magic cocktails for lives people just can't afford

Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's so hard to believe the size of the crime
Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's so hard to believe the size of the crime
Say
Say it's not real, ooh
Could be happenin' to you
Say it's not true, you can say it's not right
It's hard to believe the size of the crime
Say it's not true, say it's not real
Could be happening to you, it could be happening to me

// Surf's Up... School's Out! //

Surf's up
School's out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

I've been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You gotta follow that dream
To a perfect world

I've been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I wanna ride with you

This ride still runs
Wanna ride with you

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Gotta take it by the horns
Gotta seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream

Follow that dream
Follow that dream

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Follow that dream

// small reprise //

Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Hmm
And peace sublime

// Runaway //

As I walk along I wonder 
What went wrong with our love 
A love that was so strong 
And as I still walk on I think of 
The things we've done together 
While our hearts were young 

I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 

I'm a-walking in the rain 
Tears are falling and I feel the pain 
Wishing you were here by me 
To end this misery and I wonder 
I wah, wah, wah, wah wonder 
Why 
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away 
And I wonder when she will stay 
My little runaway, a-run, run, run, run, a-runaway 
Run run run run runaway 
Run run run run runaway

// Fire And Water //

Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way
I don't wanna say goodbye
Baby but look at the tears in my eye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Mama but look at the way you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice

And I know
Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break
A poor mans heart break

Baby you turn me on
But as quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
A poor man's heart break
And my heart is breakin' too

I don't wanna say goodbye baby
But look at the tears you made me cry
Every way that's nice
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice
And I know

Fire and water must have made you their daughter
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break

Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter
Baby you've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break
Heart break

Baby and my heart is breakin'
Oh my heart is breakin'
Oh listen
