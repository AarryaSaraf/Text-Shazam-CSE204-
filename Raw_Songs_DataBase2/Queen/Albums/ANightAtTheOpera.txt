// Death On Two Legs //

You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money, and you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
Of your own

Kill joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy
To replace me?
Can you face me?

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good. Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
I think you should
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good, feel good?

Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school boy
Let me tan your hide

Dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal, shark?

Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
You never did
...of your own
...right from the start

Insane, you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride

Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I feel good

// Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon //

I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon

Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre

I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night
(There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon.

// I'm In Love With My Car //

The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a-pumpin'
And the hubcaps all gleam

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand on your grease gun
It's like a disease son

I'm in love with my car
Gotta feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburettor
So she made tracks sayin' this is the end now
Cars don't talk back they're just four-wheeled friends now

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run-of-the-mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Gotta feel for my automobile
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String-back gloves in my automolove!

// You're My Best Friend //

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round ('Round)
But still come back to you
(Ooh, still come back to you)
In rain or shine, you've stood by me, girl (Girl)
I'm happy at home
(happy at home)
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend (Oh)

Ooh, you make me live
(Live, live, live)
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend, oh
Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live, ooh
Ooh, you're my best friend

// '39 //

In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when the lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh

For the earth is old and grey, little darling wellaway
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead
Pity me

// Sweet Lady //

Ooh, I like it

You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (sweet lady)... stay sweet

You say
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up
You hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home

Ooh, you really do
And you say
Sweet lady
(Sweet lady)
Sweet lady
(Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (ooh, come on)... stay sweet

My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need

(Got everything we need)

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Yeah, ooh, ooh)... stay sweet
Stay sweet

Runaway come on
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Sweet lady
Woo!

// Seaside Rendezvous //

Seaside
Whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile
I ask you to be my Clementine

You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand-new angle
Highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic. Can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (ooh I like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year it's so fashionable

I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea -

It's such a jollification as a matter of fact, so très charmant, my dear

Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)
Meantime (in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my Valentine

You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino

Get a new facial
Start a sensational

Seaside rendezvous — so adorable
Seaside rendezvous — ooh hoo
Seaside rendezvous — give us a kiss

// The Prophet's Song //

Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning,"
The seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man.

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.

Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning,"
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand.

Oh, oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove.

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days.

From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning,"
the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh, oh, oh, oh and two by two my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain

Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake in two will break
The earth will shake in two will break
Death all around around around around
Around around around around

Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa⟓

Listen to the wise listen to the wise listen to the wise
Listen to the wise listen to the wise man
La la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la
La la
La la
Come here (I - You)
Come here (I - You)
Come here (I - You)
Come here (I - You)

Ah ah ah ah ah
Listen to the man listen to the man listen to the man listen to the madman

God gave you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

Oh, oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer take my hand
The vision fades a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman!"

Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman!

// Love Of My Life //

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love
(All my love)
You now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back)
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you
I still love you

Back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

// Good Company //

"Take good care of what you've got,"
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
"Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company."
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her, "Won't you keep me company?"

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Come marry me for evermore
We'll be good company

Now marriage is an institution. Sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts: my own limited company

I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company

All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

// Bohemian Rhapsody //

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo
(Galileo) Galileo
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico-o-o-o-o

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)
Will not let you go (Let me go!)
Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
Oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia (Mamma mia, let me go)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows
