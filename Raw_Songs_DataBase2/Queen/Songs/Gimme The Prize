The garage is watered from the sprinklers. It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head. The head, which at this time, has no name

 I know his name

Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize

Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands
He-he-hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land:

I'll eat them whole
Before I'm done
The battle's fought
And the game is won

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize, the prize


Now you die
I have something to say: It's better to burn out than to fade away
There can be only one

Move over! I said move over!

Hey, hey, hey, clear the way!
There's no escape from my authority

Didn't I tell you?

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize

I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
So, gimme the prize


There can be only one
