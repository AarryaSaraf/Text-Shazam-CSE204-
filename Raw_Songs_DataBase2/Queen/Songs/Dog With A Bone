Hey, you say you won't, you can't give me any more love
You say you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it
You make me high when I talk on the phone
You know I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
'Cause you gotta hold on me, baby, like a dog with a bone
Hey, hey
Like a dog with a bone, yeah
Dog with a bone
One more time, yeah

Hey, you say you won't, you can't give me any more love
But you say that you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it
You make me high when I talk on the phone
You know I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
You gotta hold on me, baby, like a dog with a bone, yeah, yeah
Dog with a bone
Dog with a bone

You make me high when you talk on the phone
Ring up your number when I know you ain't home
Going on, and we're playin' together

You make me high when you talk on the phone
Ring up your number when I know you ain't home
Hold on me baby, like a dog with a bone
Hey, hey
Dog with a bone, yeah
Like a dog with a bone, yeah
Dog with a bone

You say you won't, you can't give me any more love
But you say you will, you can forgive me, but I doubt it
You make me high when I talk on the phone
I gotta ring up your number when I know you ain't home
You gotta hold on me, baby
Like a dog with a bone

Dog with a bone
