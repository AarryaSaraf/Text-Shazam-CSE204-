Please don't go
Stay, though it hurts you I know
In the moonlight bright and the shadows cold
You know you belong to me

I see your face
Your love seems a lifetime away
The shadows come and the shadows go
You know you belong to me

When the night falls
When the tears come
When the pain makes you afraid
Let the wind blow
Let the clouds come
Let the rain wash it away

For love is strange
It goes through every passing little change
When the crying's done and the shadows go
You know you belong to me

In the moonlight bright and the shadows cold
Know I belong to you
