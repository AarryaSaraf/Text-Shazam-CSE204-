Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide even if it hurts you inside
So I said, "Give as good as you get."

If you can't beat them join them
You'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

Come on go get up, hey
Sure feels good

Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine and dine me
Trying to wind me 'round and around
And bind me to your legal contract. Ha! Ha!
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that, that yeah
I'll play you at your own game
Yeah

If you can't beat them join them
You'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

That's good
Play it again

If you can't beat them join them
Oh, you'd better do it 'cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat them join them
It's everyone for themselves

Move on out!
Hey!

Oh, I like it!
Rock 'n' roll ready! Yeah
Woo-hoo!
