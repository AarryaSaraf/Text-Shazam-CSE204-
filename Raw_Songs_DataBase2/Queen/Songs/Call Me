Call me if you need my love (My love, baby)
Call me if you need my love

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

She lives in a luxury apartment
In the heart of town
I live in the country
And my house is tumbling down (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

I met her in her neighborhood (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I was just passing through (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
One look was all it took (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, one look or two (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

You got my name
You got my number
You got my number
You got my name, hey
Have mercy

Now I'm gonna settle down (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Get myself a wife or two (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
No more of this running around (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Like I used to do

Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love

Ha ha ha ha
Yeah
