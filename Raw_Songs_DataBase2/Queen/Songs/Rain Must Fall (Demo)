I can see it, oh

I can see it in your stars
Life is getting so exciting
Driving in your car
Your world is so inviting
But you're in position
To call the shots
Let me loose, hmm, honey

No problem

But into every life a little
But into every life a little rain must fall

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
In property and finance
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious, honey

Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall

Others seem to think
You are overdramatizing
Problems at work
Must be rather irritating
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, uh

It's cool

You want to clear your reputation
But into every life a little rain must fall
