Take a walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks

Where secrets lie in the border fires, in the humming wires
Hey man, you know you're never coming back
Past this square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

Red right hand
The red right hand
