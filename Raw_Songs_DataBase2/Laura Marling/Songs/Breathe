You came here to tell me something I already know
Dark before the dawn is the darkest that you know
The calm before the storm
Is what leaves me here to breathe
So breathe

Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Screaming at the earth for what 
It's done to one and all
I came here to tell you something
You already know
Just Breathe
Breathe

How cruel I am to you
Cruel things I do
How cruel you were to me
How cruel time can be
I wrote you a book 
But I left it out in the rain
Left it there to dry 
But it got rained on once again
Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Breathe
Breathe

How cruel you are to me
How cruel time can be
How cruel I was to you
How cruel things I do
-
When you wake you'll know I'm gone 
And where I'm going there's no one 
So don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
Don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
