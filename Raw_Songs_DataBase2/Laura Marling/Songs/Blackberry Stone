Well I, own this field,
And I, wrote this sky,
And I, have no reason to reason with you.

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered, but I'd
Understand that I'd never let it go.

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered, but I'd
Understand the world does what it does.

And you never did learn to let the little things go,
And you never did learn to let me be,
And you never did learn to let little people grow,
And you never did learn how to see.

But I'd whisper that I love this night now and for forever,
To your soul as it floats out of the window,
To the world that you turned your back on,
To the world that never really let you be.

And I am lower now and lower still,
And you did always say that one day I would suffer,
Did always say that people get their pay.
You did always say that I was going places,
And that you wouldn't have it any other way.

But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me.
But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed.

And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me
And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed.

And I shouldn't turn my back on the sweet smelling blackberry stone.
