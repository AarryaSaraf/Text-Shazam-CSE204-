<You kicked the blow, 
now you've got to kick the guy.
You sat alone, 
under bellowing sky.
If I feel God judging me, 
I fell into the water,
And now I'm free.

My friends they don't really get me,
think I'm the only one.
Well I sold my soul to Jesus,
and since then I've had no fun.
Behind every tree is a cutting machine, 
and a kite fallen from grace,
Inside every man is a heart of sand,
you can see it in his face.

And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

The wind and I we speak the same but he don't hear so well,
If you gonna have to curse him,
well you're gonna have to yell.
And the sky and I we've had our fights but I'm coming round to rain,
If the rain come out,
and I don't go out,
I don't ever have to speak again.

I can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
I can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

The captain's got his boots on and he's heading out the door,
Leaving his lady alone thinking, 
'He don't love me no more.'
He's done with all his bullshit, 
he's going back to war,
If heaven is as heaven does, 
then this is hell for sure

And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.
And he'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away,
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

You kicked the blow, 
now you've got to kick the guy.
You sat alone, 
under bellowing sky.
If I feel God judging me, 
I fell into the water,
And now I'm free.>
