He took a bus to meet me in a bar in a Tuscan hill
Oh a sight I'd never seen, I believe in God still
But you wouldn't be able to stop me if I feel like running away
Wouldn't be able to stop me if I didn't want to stay

And the rain fell on the houses
And on the late swaying trees
It fell its fiercest on the skulls of the willingly deceived
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God

Said he'd been sleeping lonely, spending nights under the stars
Little darling, we're all lonely, we don't all show our scars
It's my heart, and my burden, and I would never bring you down like that
My heart, my burden, I would never bring you down with me

And the rain fell on the towers and on the late swaying trees
And it hammered and it raged on us unwillingly
And the believers were forewarned, and they ran into the storm
And watched the earth's light flicker and fail
Watched the earth's light flicker and fail
Flicker and, flicker and fail

They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God where their mouth is
They put money in their hearts and God
