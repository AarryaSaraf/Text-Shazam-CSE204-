We expect dawn around morning
I trust the rise of the sun
I've been up late with the night birds
Begging the dawn not to come x2
Oh, how I don't want to leave you
So much I can't hardly bare
I have things I must tend to
Will you stay as you are, lying there
Would you stay as you are, lying there
Kissing the rain off my shoulders
Answering questions with stares
Holding my chest like I'm a wild horse about to run away scared
About to run away scared
Sun kicks the moon off the mountain
That is my cue to leave
The long tears of women are silent, so they won't wake those who sleep
So they don't wake those who sleep
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I'll come find you
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I'll come find you
I'll come get you
Hope that you haven't changed your mind
Be mine
