Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the colour and none is the number
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall
