Max came around one day
Very much nothing to say
And so we sat in silence by the road

It took awhile to land
He threw his head into his hands
And said, "This is too much for man to hope"

If you were mine
If you were mine
I'd let you live
Your life

Threw my head into his chest
I think we did our best
But now we must make good on words to God

And sit with a weary breath
No need to say the rest
I fear that we've been lost here for too long

If you were mine
If you were mine
I'd let you live
Your life

The end of the affair
I try to keep us there
Shake hands and say goodnight
I love you, goodbye
Now let me live
My life
