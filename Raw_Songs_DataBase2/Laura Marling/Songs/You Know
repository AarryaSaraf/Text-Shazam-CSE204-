Damn all those people
Who don't lose control
Who will never take a foot out of life
You might not think that I care
But you don't know what I know

And damn all those hippies
Who stomp empty footed
Upon all what's good
All what's pure of the world
You might not think that I care
But you don't know what I know

And bless all those mothers
Who do all they can
Just to take the faults out of the line
I might not know what it's like
But I'm glad that you know

Give me a minute there
Just a minute now
It'll come back to me

And I was so sure
But you
Free wheelin troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you, I know, I know
I know that you know

You asked me blind once
If I was a child once I said I'm really not sure
How can you know
How can you know
What it is you don't know

We were a pair once
Of no such despair once
We were a child then I'm sure
If we were a child then we are children no more

Give me a minute there
Just a minute now
It'll come back to me

And I was so sure
But you
Free wheelin troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you, I know, I know
I know, I know that you know
You know, you know, you know
when I know that you know
