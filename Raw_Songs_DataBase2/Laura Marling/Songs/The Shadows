Someone was sleeping while she did her leaving
Cowards go in the night
I lay there sleeping, and how could I blame her?
Who has the nerve to fight?
She knows, now, she knows now
Nothing will tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

I tried to persuade her, in vain, of course, later
That's something that I deny
I thought it was better to say in my letter
That I never even tried
She knows, of course, she knows
That one day she'll tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

She's leaving, she's leaving
My altar, she's leaving
Where will I go to pray?
I want her, I need her
I long to believe her
Words that she will not say
She knows, of course, I knew
That one day she'd tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

She's leaving, she's leaving
My altar, she's leaving
Where will I go to hide?
She lives in the shadows
Of my mind
