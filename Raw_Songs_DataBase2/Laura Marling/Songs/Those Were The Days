Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
'Member how we'd laugh away the hours
Thinking of the great things we would do?

Then those busy years went rushing by us
Lost our sorry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Is this lonely woman really me?

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Those were the days
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da-da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da-da

Through the door came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)
Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Those were the days
