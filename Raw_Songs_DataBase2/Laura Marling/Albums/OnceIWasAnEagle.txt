Album: OnceIWasAnEagle

// Take The Night Off //

You should begone beast
Begone from me
Begone from my mind at least
Let a little lady be
I don't want you to want me
Wouldn't want you to know
I don't care where you've gone beast
I care where you go

Take the night off
And be bad for me
Take it right off
And be bad for me

You're a night bird
Early riser
You have a kind of wing
To take her and surprise her
I didn't understand where you had gone
Didn't know you'd be right back
I didn't hear the night song
Calling for you into the black

Take the night off
And be bad for me

Didn't ask you to save me
Not when you knew me well
Wouldn't ask you even to behave for me
I know there's no help in hell
Take the night off
And be bad for me

Take it right off
And be bad for me

// I Was An Eagle //

So your grandmother sounds to me
A woman I would be proud to be
And you say she reminds you of me
Every little boy is so naive

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or any man
Who could get his dirty little hands on me

So your grandfather sounds like me
Head up shoulders back and proud to be
Every little girl is so naive
Falling in love with the first man that she sees

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or any man
Who could get his dirty little hands on me

When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
I was an eagle
And you were a dove

Today I will feel something other than regret
Pass me a glass and a half-smoked cigarette
I've damn near got no dignity left
I've damn near got no dignity left

I will not be a victim of romance
I will not be a victim of circumstance
Chance or circumstance or romance, or any man
Who could get his dirty little hands on me

When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
I was an eagle
And you were a dove

When we were in love (if we were)
When we were in love
You were a dove
And I rose above you and preyed

// You Know //

Damn all those people
Who don't lose control
Who will never take a foot out of life
You might not think that I care
But you don't know what I know

And damn all those hippies
Who stomp empty footed
Upon all what's good
All what's pure of the world
You might not think that I care
But you don't know what I know

And bless all those mothers
Who do all they can
Just to take the faults out of the line
I might not know what it's like
But I'm glad that you know

Give me a minute there
Just a minute now
It'll come back to me

And I was so sure
But you
Free wheelin troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you, I know, I know
I know that you know

You asked me blind once
If I was a child once I said I'm really not sure
How can you know
How can you know
What it is you don't know

We were a pair once
Of no such despair once
We were a child then I'm sure
If we were a child then we are children no more

Give me a minute there
Just a minute now
It'll come back to me

And I was so sure
But you
Free wheelin troubadour
You took my mind off the scene
And you, I know, I know
I know, I know that you know
You know, you know, you know
when I know that you know

// Breathe //

You came here to tell me something I already know
Dark before the dawn is the darkest that you know
The calm before the storm
Is what leaves me here to breathe
So breathe

Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Screaming at the earth for what 
It's done to one and all
I came here to tell you something
You already know
Just Breathe
Breathe

How cruel I am to you
Cruel things I do
How cruel you were to me
How cruel time can be
I wrote you a book 
But I left it out in the rain
Left it there to dry 
But it got rained on once again
Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Breathe
Breathe

How cruel you are to me
How cruel time can be
How cruel I was to you
How cruel things I do
-
When you wake you'll know I'm gone 
And where I'm going there's no one 
So don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
Don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see

// Master Hunter //

I am a master hunter
I cured my skin, now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries

You want a woman cause you want to be saved
Well I'll tell you that I got a little lot on my plate
Well if you want a woman who can call your name, it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe

I don't stare at water anymore,
Water doesn't do what it did before,
It took me in into the edge of insane when I only meant to swim,
I nearly put a bullet in my brain when the rhythm took me in

I am a master hunter

You let men into your bed
They don't know you well
They can't get into my head
They don't have a hope in hell

See the thing is we are so alone
There's nothing we can share
You can get me on the telephone but you won't keep me there
No, no, no, you won't keep me there

Take me somewhere I can grow
Give me something let me go
Tell me something I don't know
I, I have some news
I have some news
Is this what you think I do
In life when I'm not being used
You're not sad, you look for the blues
You're not sad, you look for the blues
I have some news
Wrestling the rope from darkness is no fucking life that I would choose

I am a master hunter
I cured my skin, now nothing gets in
Nothing not as hard as it tries

I am a master, I am a master, I am a master hunter

// Little Love Caster //

Yes I am, yes I am a master.
I had you, bad man.
Little love, little love caster
Palm of my hand.

I wish that I had, I wish that I had've told you then
Where my kindness ends.

I will take you home, I will take you home and then
Our lovespell will end

You are new to me
You are new to me
And I can't seem to say
"I'd like you to stay"

Yes I am, yes I am a master
I had you, bad man
Little love, little love caster

They might know you best, they might know you best and love you most
But I would breathe you in
I would breathe you in and be your ghost.

I saw a lady dance yesterday
She was easily swayed
I cannot be tossed and turned in this way
I'm not your tiny dancer

I can't seem to say,
"I'd like you to stay."

I saw a lady dance yesterday, 
She is easily swayed.
I cannot be tossed and turned in this way.
I'm no one's tiny dancer.

And I can't seem to say,
"I'd like you to stay."
I can't seem to say,
"I'd like you to stay."

// Devil's Resting Place //

I woke up one morning to know that I had gone
Finally taken the step and jumped right off the wall
When you come to call on me that's why my eyes are glazed
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place
I am loathed to say that I have been to stay
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place

When you ask to drink of me I think out on the case
Look down to my aloe cup and take myself a taste
Bitterness is thick like blood and cold as a wind sea breeze
If you must drink of me, take of me what you please
I am loathed to say it's the devil's taste
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place

Water won't clean you, water won't clean you
You only hold yourself to the things you do

Come up here to speak to me and hold your face to mine
Any man can hold my gaze has done his job just fine
You just sold your life away to be with me tonight
Hold your head against my chest, I think you'll be just fine
I am loathed to say it's the devil's place
I go with the devil where the devil rests his face
I've been with the devil where the devil rests his face

Water won't clean you, water won't clean you
Water won't clean you, water won't clean you
You only hold yourself to the things you do
You only hold yourself to the things you do

// Undine //

Made my steps towards the water
Where Undine last was seen
I was told that if you saw her
It should make you more naive
Made my steps towards the shore
She sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Make me more naive
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, knowing I'd love this lovely scene

There were ropes around my wrist
And the tide pulled at her hair
Pulling her away from me
And me away from there
Yes the water tried to take her
Tried to make poor Undine hide
But she fought herself against it
Love in her had not yet died
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, fight your way, fight your way

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot

What's going on in there?
What's going on in there?
Let me in

It's cold there in December
So I took my coat and left
Left Undine by the embers
That's all our fire had left
Left Undine by the shore
Where she sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Knowing I'd love this lovely scene 

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot

What's going on in there?
What's going on in there?
Let me in

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot
You cannot love me

// Where Can I Go? //

I was a daddy's girl sometime
But I loved my mama til the end of the line
I am cold and I am bright
It's a curse of mine to be sad at night
It's a curse of mine to be sad at night

Late at night he'll come to me and he'll tell me I'm alone
Don't you think I don't already know?
All I see is road
No one takes me home
Where, where can I go?

Truth about desire they say
Is a need to breathe for another day
Truth I heard about regret
It's the hardest truth I've come to yet
It's the hardest truth I've come to yet

Late at night he'll come to me and he'll tell me I'm alone
Don't you think I don't already know?
All I hear are wars
There's something I don't know
Where, where can I?

All I see is road
No one takes me home
Where, where can I?

If I feel like I want to be alone
If I feel like I'm better fought than won

Pick up your rope and jump for Rosie
She's just a sweet thing with her curls
Just about a woman with her clothes on
You take 'em off and she's a girl

All I hear are words
There's something I don't know
Where, where can I?

// Once //

In the land I now know to be mine
There the heart is so dark it's near blind
When I think about the life I've left behind
I still raise no praise to the sky

With my eyes on the prize of your bed
When all that's needed saying has been said
When I think about the life that I have led
I laid down to the sound of the the wise

Once, once is enough to break you
Once, once is enough to make you think twice
About laying your love out on the line

With all I now know to be true
And all I've figured out about you
All the crazy things a mind can do
I laid down to the sound of the truth

Once, once is enough to break you
Once, once is enough to make you think twice
About laying your little love out on the line

O, I was a child once
O, I was happy young
When all I didn't know needed doing
Had been done

// Pray For Me //

Where does my lover lie
I don't know I just lie
Pray, pray for me

But where he runs
I run in tow
And where you're from
I long to know

How does a child know
Where mother's weakness goes
And where, and where the trouble grows
Well you will speak
And it shall be so
And what you say
Will be all I know

There was a time of weeks
I thought dogs barked at me
And I, and I had lost my mind
And the devil had put
His mark on me
And called his branches
Shake the tree

That wasn't me for my trying
That was the devil and his lying
Trying to make me lose my mind
O pray, o pray for me

So you got my letter late
From where I permanently etched my name
Right, right into your song
I cannot love, I won't to be long
I will not love
I want to be alone

That's not me for my trying
That was the devil and his lying
Trying to make me when
I'm trying to be good
O pray, o pray for me

And where you run
I run in tow
And where he's from
I long to know
And you will speak
And it shall be so
I cannot love
I want to be alone
O pray, o pray for me

// When Were You Happy? (And How Long Has That Been) //

Hey there new friend across the sea
If you figure things out would you figure in me
Wouldn't it be a thing
To live somewhere quietly where there's a breeze
And there's a reason for us to be

I look at people here in this city and wonder if they're lonely
or like me they're not content to live as things are meant to be
When were you happy?
And how long has that been?

Who speaks for them and then again
Who speaks for me?
My vote was never counted, so who upon this earth knows what it is that I believe?
We're all looking for answers where no answers can be found
Or is that a concern of mine
Because I have the time
To question my ground?

Hey there new friend across the sea
Have you figured things out? Would you figure in me?
Hey there new friend across the sea
Have you figured things out? Would you figure in me?

I find the more I think the harder it is for me to breathe
When were we happy?
And how long has that been?

// Love Be Brave //

In a world you can get lost in
I find my way to him
I am purpose and regret
You're a feeling I'll forget

What will I do then?
How did I sleep at night
With you far from my side?
Hold me darling, make no sound
Silence speaks for me

Love be brave
No one will say it but you
And that has not yet been
The easy thing for you to do

How does he make love seem sweet
Isn't that some heavy feat
Do the birds suffer so
Do they sing because they know
This life don't go slow

Love be brave
No one will save you but me
And that has not yet been
The safest place for you to be

What will I do then?
Here comes a change over me
Something strange takes over me
I am brave and love is sweet
And silence speaks for him and me

// Little Bird //

O Rosie
Where have you been
I couldn't save you
But I tried, Rosie
I tried

Why did you run
From everyone
Who only tried to
Love you, Rosie
Only tried

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Why do you run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, only tries...

Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

So why not run
From everyone
Who only tries to
Love you, Rosie, only tries...

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you
With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

Maybe I like pleasure pain
Of going and coming back again
What I leave behind
I come back to find
It's no longer mine

Little bird, if I only knew
Maybe I'd be more like you

With a feather in my wing
Is it spring?
Do I sing?

// Saved These Words //

When your work is over
Your day is done
Put down your hammer
Into my world come

Life is heavy
And you're no master, son
When you're ready
Into my arms come
Into my arms come

Love's not easy
Not always fun
And words are sleazy
My love is better done
My love is better done

Should you choose
Should you choose
To love anyone
Anytime soon
Then I save these words for you

You weren't my curse
You weren't my curse
Thank you naivety for failing me again
He was my next verse

Should you choose
Should I choose
To love anyone
Anytime soon
Then I save these words for you

You weren't my curse
You weren't my curse
Thank you naivety for failing me again
He was my next verse

I saved these words for you
