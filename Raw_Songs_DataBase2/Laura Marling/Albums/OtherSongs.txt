// A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall //

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the colour and none is the number
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

// Bonny Portmore //

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the boys in Old England could not purchase Portmore

O bonny Portmore, I am sorry to see
The woeful destruction of your ornament tree
It sat on your shore for many's a long day
Till the long boats of Antrim came to float it away

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the boys in Old England could not purchase Portmore

// Daisy //

Daisy lives by the docks
Down at the white rock
Running an open home
Daisy lives by the sea
I only see Daisy 
When she wants to see me

Daisy's alright
She's up all night
Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
A woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy met a man from Sicily
Sailed in one day and told her 
Who she was going to be 
O did he look at her strange
For no one and nobody
Is Daisy going to change

Daisy's alright 
She's up all night Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
Woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy's got a baby now
She called her Angelina 
So she'd stand out of the crowd
Daisy doesn't care from where she seeds
As far as she's concerned 
She is immaculately conceived

Daisy's alright 
She's up all night
Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
Woman alone is not a woman undone

// David //

I look west and I believe
There's the sky that David breathes
I look west and I believe
He looks east and he thinks of me

David won't see me anymore
I open gates that close his doors
Just to know he lives and breathes
will have to be enough for me

Sat down one day and I swallowed my pride
Begged him not to leave my life
There's an angel walking Earth
Once you've been touched
everything else is dirt

With a tear in my eye
and a lump in my throat
I read David's final note
Goodbye, be well, I'll think of you
'Til the Sun turns black or the stars go blue

// I'm A Fly //

I'm a fly, I'll die tomorrow
So give me all you've got
I so believe, I so believe
I'm a fly, I'll die tomorrow
So give me all you've got

And out here in this foreign place
I have let you down
I've fallen for a foreign face
And I've fallen to the ground

I've gone in blinding, scorching sun
And fallen to my knees
And I've forgotten what I believed
And I so believe, I so believe
In the good in all of us.

// London Town //

I know, I know she came to save you,
But she knocked my drink over too.
And I know, I know that she wants you,
She looks at you the way that I do.

Well if you think that I'm lying,
Why would I give up trying so soon?

Where'd you go, where'd you go,
Where'd you leave me of my soul?
Where'd you go?
And how's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,
Where you let me down?

And I know, I know what you've been through,
You think I don't care but I really do.
And I know, I know that it hurts you,
But you'd be pleased that she is,
Now what would you do?

Well if you think that I'm lying,
Why would I give up trying so soon?

Where'd you go, where'd you go,
Where'd you leave me of my soul?
Where'd you go?
How's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,
Where you let me down?

And it's all of bad things, 
I wish I hadn't done.
I know your rule about the dancing,
But I, I just don't find it fun.
Would you care if i cared to?
Would you run from you?

Where'd you go, where'd you go,
Where'd you leave me of my soul?
Where'd you go?
And how's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,
Where you let me down?

// Needle And The Damage Done //

I caught you knocking
at my cellar door
I love you, baby
can I have some more

Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and
I lost my band
I watched the needle
take another man

Gone, gone, the damage done

I sing the song
because I love the man
I know that some
of you don't understand

Milk-blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle
and the damage done
A little part of it
in everyone

Every junkie's like a setting sun

I've seen the needle
and the damage done
A little part of it 
in everyone

Every junkie's like a setting sun

// Red Right Hand //

Take a walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks

Where secrets lie in the border fires, in the humming wires
Hey man, you know you're never coming back
Past this square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

Red right hand
The red right hand

// She's Changed //

A word of warning goes to you, my man
I hope you understand that when she grabs you by the hand she needs security
Is it hard to comprehend that when she isn't your friend she is not nice to see
Maybe you won't get your heart broken too
'Cause she's changed, yeah, she's changed 
No! Just joking, she's still the same 
So, why do you bother, I ask myself

She was so young
And so far gone
And he was your average man
She never liked to stay with one person too long, she never liked to keep a plan
She couldn't keep her concentration, she never had much to say
She found a perfect occupation, if you want her you're gonna have to pay

A word of warning goes to you, my man
I hope you understand that when she grabs you by the hand she needs security
Is it hard to comprehend that when she isn't your friend she is not nice to see
Maybe you won't get your heart broken too
'Cause she's changed, yeah, she's changed 
No! Just joking, she's still the same 
Why do you bother, I ask myself

Wear your short skirt out tonight and shout at the chav as he shines a light
That you love so much it makes you different inside
You're so different from every other ?slag?
Make eyes with the fit one looking at you
Don't let on you've got a boyfriend or two
Then chat some rubbish about new old bands,
They're the new libertines slightly, such as

A word of warning goes to you, my man
I hope you understand that when she grabs you by the hand she needs security
Is it hard to comprehend that when she isn't your friend she is not nice to see
Maybe you won't get your heart broken too
'Cause she's changed, yeah, she's changed 
No! Just joking, she's still the same 
So, why do you bother, I ask myself

// The Shadows //

Someone was sleeping while she did her leaving
Cowards go in the night
I lay there sleeping, and how could I blame her?
Who has the nerve to fight?
She knows, now, she knows now
Nothing will tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

I tried to persuade her, in vain, of course, later
That's something that I deny
I thought it was better to say in my letter
That I never even tried
She knows, of course, she knows
That one day she'll tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

She's leaving, she's leaving
My altar, she's leaving
Where will I go to pray?
I want her, I need her
I long to believe her
Words that she will not say
She knows, of course, I knew
That one day she'd tear me apart
She lives in the shadows
Of my heart

She's leaving, she's leaving
My altar, she's leaving
Where will I go to hide?
She lives in the shadows
Of my mind

// Those Were The Days //

Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
'Member how we'd laugh away the hours
Thinking of the great things we would do?

Then those busy years went rushing by us
Lost our sorry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Is this lonely woman really me?

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Those were the days
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da-da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da, da-da
La, da-da-da

Through the door came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)
Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young, born to have our way
(Born to have our way)

Those were the days
