// Alexandra //

What became of Alexandra
Did she make through?
What kind of woman gets to love you?
Wrote us all a little note
Nothing left to lose
What kind of woman gets to love you?

I need to know
Where did Alexandra go?

Alexandra had no fear
She lived out in the woods
She'd tell you what you're doing wrong
If she thinks she'll be understood
Pulls her socks up to her knees
Finds diamonds in the drain
One more diamond to add to her chain

I need to know
Where does Alexandra go?
Where did Alexandra go?

It won't change how I'm feeling
You can try to help me understand
If she left you like a woman
Did you feel like a man?

I need to know
Where did Alexandra go?
Where did Alexandra go?

You had to say, your shit to bed
You could not bear the unsaid
I had to try, a fuck to give
Why should I die so you can live?

What did Alexandra know?
What did Alexandra know?
What did Alexandra know?

// Held Down //

I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"
(Long, long, long)

And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down, down, down)
And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to get you wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong)

Think about now with my legs wrapped around you
How many times before have you seen me run?
(Run, run, run)
It's a cruel kinda twist that you'd leave like this
Just drop my wrist and say, "Well, that's us done"
(Done, done, done)

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down down down)
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

You sent me a book, which you gave half a look
But I just don't care for, and I cannot get through
(Through, through, through)
But you're writing again, and I'm glad, old friend
I'll make sure you write me out of where you get to
(To, to, to)

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down down down)
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

'Cause we all want to be here now
And we all want to be held down
And we all want to be here now
And we all want to be held down

I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"

And I just mean to tell you
That I don't want to be let down
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

// Strange Girl //

Get all your records out and throw them all away
No one left to listen to, much left, less to say
Working hard and getting on, still not getting paid
Stay low, keep brave

Woke up in a country who refused to hold your hand
Kept falling for narcissists who insist you call them 'man'
You work late for a job you hate that's never fit the plan
Stay low, keep brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Build yourself a garden and have something to attend
Cut off all relations 'cause you could not stand your friends
Announced yourself a socialist to have something to defend
Oh, young girl, please, don't bullshit me

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Changed how you feel, it's good to break the seal
And blow us both away
It's changing all the time and it starts to blur the line
It's supposed to keep you safe

And you row like a tidal wave
And you row like a tidal wave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

// Only The Strong //

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Only the wrong relive their lives
We've been here a thousand times

Wish I could go back and find
Letters I wrote you in my mind
Perhaps I could unknot us from this awful bind

Most I have forgot are all very fine
Love is a sickness cured by time
Love is a sickness cured by time
Bruises all end up benign
Love is a sickness cured by time

I hope that you can change my mind
Had to leave this crying all behind
I hope that you don't think that I'm unkind
So somebody told me, only and only
Only the strong will survive

Only the strong survive
And I won't write a woman with a man on my mind
Hope that didn't sound too unkind

Just struggling to figure out how only, only
Only, only
Only the strong can survive
Hope that you can change my mind
I had to leave this crying all behind
I hope that you don't think that I'm unkind
It's just somebody told me only and only
Only the strong can survive

// Blow By Blow //

I don't know what else to say
I think I did my best
Momma's on the phone already talking to the press
Tell them that I'm doing fine
Underplay distress
I'm working out a story and there's so much to address

Note by note
Blow by blow
Seeing it all laid out
I should have known

I don't know what else to say
I think I'm doing fine
Tryna figure out what I will do with all my time
Tell them anything you like
I'll own up to what's mine
Knowing thunder gives away what lightening tries to hide

No one was prepared
But we all performed
Like we'd done it all before

Note by note
Bruise by bruise
Sometimes the hardest thing to learn
Is what you get from what you lose

I feel a fool, so do you
For believing it could work out
Like some things do

// Song For Our Daughter //

Though they may want you to tread in their trail
Only to see if the path they set fails
Though they may want you to take off your clothes
Whatever they think that the action exposed
With your clothes on the floor
Taking advice from some old balding bore
You'll ask yourself, "Did I want this at all?"

Do you remember what I said?
The book I left by your bed
The words that some survivor read

Lately I've been thinking about our daughter growing old
All of the bullshit that she might be told
There's blood on the floor
Maybe now you'll believe her for sure
She remembers what I said
The book I left by her bed
The words that some survivor read

Though they may take you for all you had left
You won't be forgotten for what you had not done yet
So you wished for a kiss from God
And you mourned in your childish loss
Innocence gone but it's not forgot
You'll get your way through it somehow

You remember what I said
The book you left by your bed
The words that will outlive the dead

// Fortune //

You took out that money that your momma had saved
She told me she kept it for running away
Oh my, fortunes can change

You've picked up some tricks that you learnt on your way
For fear you'd be lonely if you never change
Oh my, you lost your faith

We landed on rocks and that's partly to blame
We wandered the landscape in this unbearable pain
Oh my, your fortune can change

At least we agree that we've wasted our time
We'll give up the hope that we'll meet down the line
Better off measured in coffee than wine

I think on it fondly now the truth can be told
Some love is ancient and it lives on in your soul
A fortune that never grows old

You spent all that money that your momma had saved
Told me she kept it for running away
Never quite found the right way to say
I'm sorry, my darling, my mind it has been changed
Release me from this unbearable pain

And so ends a story I had hoped to change
I had to release us from this unbearable pain
And promise we won't come here again

// The End Of The Affair //

Max came around one day
Very much nothing to say
And so we sat in silence by the road

It took awhile to land
He threw his head into his hands
And said, "This is too much for man to hope"

If you were mine
If you were mine
I'd let you live
Your life

Threw my head into his chest
I think we did our best
But now we must make good on words to God

And sit with a weary breath
No need to say the rest
I fear that we've been lost here for too long

If you were mine
If you were mine
I'd let you live
Your life

The end of the affair
I try to keep us there
Shake hands and say goodnight
I love you, goodbye
Now let me live
My life

// Hope We Meet Again //

I've lived my life in fits and spurts
Maybe I've had more than I deserve
I'm sure I cannot feel much worse
I kept your letter, I read your words

I tried to give you love and truth
But you're acid tongued, serpent-toothed
I tried to share the map with you
But you knew your way, you had your route

I will find God in the hands of truth

Left my heart with a man in those eastern woods
He is people-shy but his words are good
And I hope that he won't fade away
I should write to him tomorrow, I wrote that yesterday

Home, this is not a home anymore
You just threw your pieces, they washed up on my shore
I have not lived any other way
It is my right to wander, I might choose to stay

I will find God in the strangest place

I saw the sign for the old highway
You did cross my mind but it didn't change
I do hope that we meet again someday
Hope we meet again, I hope you never change
I hope that we meet again, hope you never change

// For You //

I drew pictures of you
Long before I met you
Just a fragment of my mind

I had called out for you
Almost every night
Precious things are hard to find

It was just an evening
Much like any else
When you came into my life

It takes one to know one
And I saw you there
As I had seen you all my life

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted (For you)
I write it so I don't forget
Never let it get away
I wear a picture of you
Just to keep you safe

Now that I have you
I will not forget
What a miracle you are

No childish expectation
Love is not the answer
But the line that marks the start

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted (For you)
I write it so I don't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted
I write it so I won't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted
I sing it so I won't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe
