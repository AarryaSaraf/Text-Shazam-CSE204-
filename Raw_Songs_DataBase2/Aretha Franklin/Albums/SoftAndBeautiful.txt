Album: SoftAndBeautiful

// A Mother's Love //

I have seen a rainbow
Circle across the sky
And I have stood on a mountain
And watched an eagle fly

I have seen trees in a meadow
Shelter a morning dove
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

I have seen a sunset
More beautiful than gold
And I have stood by a rosebed
And watched the leaves unfold

I have seen so many wonders
And blessings from above
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

No, I still haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

// I Wish I Didn't Love You So //

I, I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have ended long ago
Ooh and I, I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why should your kiss torture me as long as this?

I should be smiling by now with some new tender friend
Smiling by now with my heart on the mend

But when I try, something in my heart says no
You're still there and I wish I didn't love you so
Ooh I, I wish I didn't love you so

// (Ah, The Apple Trees) When The World Was Young //

It isn't by chance I happen to be
The belle of the ball, the toast of Paris
Over the noise, the talk and smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or a ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
A drink for my friends, a drink for them all
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay, games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we are having a game"
Wherever I go, it's so glad I came
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine
And thousands of men, some who are mine
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees, sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

// Shangri-La //

Shangri-La, Shangri-La

Your kisses take me to Shangri-La
Each kiss is magic
That makes my little world a Shangri-La

A land of bluebirds, fountains
And nothing to do
But cling to a lover just like you

And when you hold me, how warm you are
Be mine, my darling
And spend your life with me in Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
(Shangri-La, Shangri-La)

// My Coloring Book //

In case you fancy coloring books, and lots of people do
I've a new one for you
A most unusual coloring book, the kind you'd never see
Crayons ready, very well, begin to color me

These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away
Color them gray
This is the heart that thought he would always be true
Color it blue
These are the arms that held him, and touched him, then lost him somehow
Color them empty now
These are the beads I wore until she came between
If you like, color them green

This is the room I sleep in and walk in and weep in and hide in
That nobody ever sees, color it lonely, please
This is the man, the one, the one I depended upon
You must color him gone
He's gone, color him gone

// Jim //

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
I don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years that I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get to feeling low
And I say "Let's call it quits"
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart into bits

Someday, someday I know Jim will up and leave me
But if he does, you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim (Jim)

// Friendly Persuasion (Thee I Love) //

I love thee, more than the meadow where the grass is so still
More than the mulberries on the hill
More than the buds on the mayapple tree, I love thee

Arms have I, strong as the oak, for this occasion
Lips have I, to kiss thee sweet, in friendly persuasion

Thee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
I have on my bonnet, my cape, and my gloves
And I'll go with thee, for thee I love

// But Beautiful //

Love is funny or it's sad
It's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
So beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking that I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache anyway
But it's still so beautiful

And I'm thinking, ooh, ooh, if you were mine
Why I'd never let you go
And this would be so beautiful, I know
This would be beautiful, I know

// People //

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special, special people
'Cause they're the luckiest people in the world
One person, just one very special person
A feeling so deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
