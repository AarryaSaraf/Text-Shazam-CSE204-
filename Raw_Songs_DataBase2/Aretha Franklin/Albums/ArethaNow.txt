// I Say A Little Prayer //

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you

My darling, believe me
(Believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
(Answer my prayer)
And I'm in love with you
(Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer now, babe
(Answer my prayer)

Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

// See Saw //

Sometimes you love me
Like a good man oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad
My tears run like water
Ya get me out
Not before your friends
When ya disown me baby
Until we alone again

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up 
Down 
All around 
Like a see saw

Sometimes you tell me
You're goin' be my sweet candy man
And then sometimes baby
Never know where I stand
Ya lift me up
When im on the ground
But as soon as I get up babe
You send me tumblin' down

Now your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up 
Down 
All around 
Just like a see saw

When I kiss ya and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you you jump clean outta site
Ya change just like the wind
That ain't right
That ain't right
That ain't right

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
You love is like a see saw 
Going up 
Down 
All around
Just like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up 
Down 
All around 
Just like a see saw
Yeah

// Hello Sunshine //

Hello sunshine
(Hello)
So glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

I can't explain what I've been through
(No, no)
Trying to live my life without you
People say I act so strange
(Oh, yeah)
But you got the power to make me change

Hello sunshine
(Hello)
I'm so glad to see you sunshine
Hello sunshine
(Hello)
It's been dark for a very long time

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Lonely)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(My heart)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
The wonders of spring
Don't mean a thing

Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
(Without you)

Now I know everything is alright
(You know)
No more pain, no more sleepless nights
(Oh yeah)
My days were dark but now I see
(Oh yeah)
Because my sunshine has come home to me.

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place
(Oh yeah)
And without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space
(Oh yeah)

Without you sunshine
(Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain
(Oh yeah)
They don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing)
The wonders of spring
(Don't mean a thing)

Without you, baby
(Don't mean a thing)
Without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby
(Without you sunshine)

// A Change //

There's an old friend
That I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way

I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been runnin' ever since
He said it's been a long time comin'
But I know my change is gonna come
Oh yeah

He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew
What was up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time comin'
But I know my change has got to come
Oh yeah

I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, "Brother
Could you help me, please?"
He said, "Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able"
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees
Yes I was, oh

There I've been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow right now I believe
That I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been along
And oh it's been an uphill journey
All the way
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come
Sometimes I had to cry all night long
Yes I did
Sometimes I had to give up right
For what I knew was wrong
Yes it's been an uphill journey
It's sure's been a long way comin'
Yes it has
It's been real hard
Every step of the way
But I believe, I believe
This evenin' my change is come
Yeah I tell you that
My change is come

// I Can't See Myself Leaving You //

You've been running around
This I know, yeah
I ought to pack my things
And let you go

But baby
I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa, no, I can't
See myself leaving you

You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes, you have

If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa, oh, my love

I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself 
Going away to stay
Oh no, I can't
See myself leaving you, no

True love 
Is so hard to find
Tell me, tell me
That I've got mine

If I go
Searching for another
I'd just be wasting
My time, yeah, hey

I say we're through
Because I love you
Yes, I do
If I leave you, baby
What would I do?

Whoa, oh, oh, my love
I wouldn't know what to do
Cause I can't see 
Myself leaving you

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I can't see myself
Leaving you, no

I can't see myself
Leaving you

Whoa, no
I can't see myself...
