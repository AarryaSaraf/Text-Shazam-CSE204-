// Son Of A Preacher Man //

Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered around and starting talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes he was, he was, ooh, yes he was

Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin'  to me
He'd come'n tell me "Everything is all right"
He'd kiss and tell me "Everything is all right"
Can I get away again tonight?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who can ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes he was, he was, ooh, yes he was (yes he was)

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacherman
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacherman
Yes he was, he was, ooh, yes he was

(The only one who could ever reach me)
He was the sweet-talkin' son of a preacherman
(The only boy who could ever teach me)
Was the son of a preacherman

(The only one who could ever reach me)
Was the sweet-talkin' son of a preacherman

// Share Your Love With Me //

It's an evil wind
That blows no good air
It's a sad heart
That won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome (oh how lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)
It's a shame (shame)
You don't share your love with me

It's a heartache yeah
(It's a heartache)
When love is gone
(It's a heartache)
But it's bad
(Bad) and even sad (sad)
All day long

And it's no wonder
When you won't see me
It's a shame
(shame)
If you won't share
Some of your love with me

I can't help it oh no
If he's gone
I must try to forget
Because I got to live on
Ooooh
Have me some good thing
It's a sweet thing
(Its a sweet thing)
But you love someone eles
(Such a sweet thing)

But It's bad (bad)
And even sadder (sad)
When it's not the time

And Ooooooooooh
How lonesome... how lonesome
How lonesome baby
(Lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)

I tell ya it would be a sad (sad)
Shame (shame)
If you don't share
Your love with me
(Share your love with me)

It would really be a mistake baby
(If you say it)
If you don't share
Your love with me
(Share your love with me)

It would sure be a shame
(Shame shame)
If you don't share
Share your love with me
Share your love with me
Come on bab - ay

// Dark End Of The Street //

At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street

I know that time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
But tonight we will meet at the dark end of the street

They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me

And when the daylight roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me

They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me

// Let It Be //

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

// Eleanor Rigby //

I'm Eleanor Rigby
I picked up the rice in the church where the weddings have been
Yeah I'm Eleanor Rigby
I'm keepin' my face in a jar by the door
If you wanna know what is it for, Well

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon 
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Knoting his socks in the night
What does he care, Yeah

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands 
As he walks from the grave

// This Girl's In Love With You //

Say you're in love and you'll be my guy, if not I'll just die

Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know

// The Weight //

I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No," was all he said.

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
She said, "Well I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

Go down, Moses, there's nothin' that you can say
It's just like ol' Luke waitin', waitin' on Judgement Day.
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favour, stay an' keep Anna Lee some company."

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

Catch me a cannon ball, now take me on down the line
My bag is sinkin' low, and I believe that it's about time.
To get in touch with Annie, you know she's the one.
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone?

Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free;
Take a load off Annie, And (and) (and) put the weight on me.

// Sit Down And Cry //

Baby, no one could have told me
How could they have told me
When they didn't know?

I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Over you, oh

No one, no one could have warned me
That you would scar me yeah
And hurt me so bad

And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over you

Oh, who would ever believe?
That lips sweet as yours
Sweeter than the honey
From the bees

Tell, who would ever believe?
That those same sweet lips
Would lie, lie like
Lie like you lied to me, yeah

Baby, no one, no one could ever told me
I wouldn't hear it
That you would have sold me, yeah
Down the river so fast

And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby, yeah
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over you

Yes I will, yeah, I will sit down and cry, baby
I will sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Heart out over you, yes I would
Hey, hey, hey, baby, yeah, sit down and cry baby
