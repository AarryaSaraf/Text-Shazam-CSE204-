// Why Was I Born? //

Why was I born, why am I livin'?
What do I get, what am I givin'?
Why do I want a thing I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for? I wish I knew

Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry? You never hear me
I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?

Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry? You never hear me

I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?

Some other versions may include an
Spending these lonesome evenings with nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up all by myself
Dreaming that you're beside me, I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up all by myself What is the good of me by myself?

// I May Never Get To Heaven //

I walked with you and talked with you
And held your lovin' hand
We loved a while, I lived a while
And thought fate had a plan

Oh, but someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never ever get to heaven
But I once came mighty close

Never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings
Or walk up a golden staircase
While the distant chorus sings

I once held your sweet love
And I felt your tender touch
I may never ever get to heaven
But I didn't miss it much

I may never ever ever get to heaven
But I did, I really didn't miss it much
(Miss it much)

// Tighten Up Your Tie, Button Up Your Jacket (Make It For The Door) //

Don't get too comfortable, my boy

And make it for the door (make it for the door)

Don't get too close to me, my boy

I couldn't take it any more (uh, uh)

So tighten up your tie (tighten up)
Button up that jacket (button up)
And make it for the door (make it for the door)

And he just wouldn't understand
You had romance but you blew your chance
Trying to play a double hand
You know that I'm weak for you, my boy (auh bop, auh bop)
Ah, did you just come around to see (auh bop, auh bop)
If your sweet and tender charms (auh bop, auh bop)
Would still work out on me? (auh bop, auh bop)

Well, even if you did (if you did)
You can still grab your hat (your hat)
'Cause now I know the score (uh, uh, uh)
Tighten up your tie (tighten up)
Button up your jacket (button up)
And make it for the door (make it for the door)

Let it hit you in the back, make it for the door (tighten up your tie, uh, ah ah ah)

Oh, then button up that shark skin (make it for the door, uh, ah ah ah)
Baby, and make it for the door (tighten up your tie)

// Her Little Heart Went To Loveland //

Her little heart went to Loveland
His little heart stayed at home
Her little heart gave all the love it could impart
His little heart gave none

She took the road to forever
Would she leaving? Never
Maybe she wasn't too clever
But when love finds one it blinds one

He made her journey so exciting
Oh, how the world spun around
Locked in his embrace, lost in time and space
But his never left the ground

This little girl is a sad little girl
Who must endlessly roam
Her little heart went to Loveland
But his fickle heart stayed home

Take it like you give it

Baby, can I say that I'm sorry
For the things I said last night
But I'm human too, just like you
When I don't always do things right
And sometimes you aren't so very nice
But I smile and still pay the price
Now, if you love me let me see your limit

And just take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it)
Take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it)

// Only The One You Love //

Only the one you love can hurt you (can hurt you)
Only the one you trust in most of all (most of all)
Nobody else you know (you know)
Could ever hurt you so (you so)
Or tear you all apart

Only the one you love can fool you (can fool you)
Only the one who's closest to your heart (to your heart)
And that's cause you can't believe
He ever would deceive
Or leave you or let you fall or let you die (uh uh, uh uh)

Strangers can't harm you
It's been proved many times before
Only the one you love can hurt you
But each hurt makes you love him more and more (more and more, more and more)
But each hurt, it makes you love him more and more (more and more, more and more)
Every little hurt makes you love him...

// Remember Me //

Remember me
I'm the girl you said hello to
And gave a special glow to
One sweet yesterday

Remember me
And the times we had together
We swore they'd last forever
Darling come what may

How could two people so much in love drift so far apart?
Oh my darling, could it be possible I was never, never in your heart?

Remember me
I'm the girl you said you'd always love
You swore by stars above
Oh, don't you recall ever having love me, love me at all?

// Land Of Dreams //

In the land of my dreams
You're sweeter than ever before
In the land of my dreams
You love me so much more
I am over here so I'll stay, you'll never stay
If they could only be real (if they could only be real)
Instead of just in my head

In the land of this wonderful dream (wonderful dream)
I imagine you all so close
Telling all of the girls who love you to
You love me the most (love me the most)
And when you walk by, I start to laugh of dream and glow
Cause when I wanna be with you
I close my eyes and all way I go, go, go (the way I go)

In the land of my dreams
Where it's give and take
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your, give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way

// A Little Bit Of Soul //

Sitting here thinking
I'm trying to write a song
If I don't get me a hit soon
I won't be here long

I got a lyric writer
Got me a piano man
And we're making these words
Just as tight as we can

Now we want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give us a whole lot of soul

Now, hey little boy
Come over here with me
And you show me how
To do that dance called the plip

Can you show me how to wobble?
Can we do it together?
Come on and let's bend over
Come on and let's shake a tail feather

We want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give me a whole lot of soul

Soul (soul), soul (soul)
Soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)

Now, how am I doing? (Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright? (Doing alright now)
I got this song (doing alright now)
And I got this boy (doing alright now)

I got a piano man (ah, ah, ah)
And a great big band (ah, ah, ah)
Now, I wanna hear the trumpets (ah, ah, ah)
Blowing out loud

Let me see the action
Coming in from the crowd
And take me, rock by my hand (doing alright now)

A little bit of soul, and
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)

Tell me how am I doing?
(Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
(You're doing alright now)
Tell me how am I doing?
(You're doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
