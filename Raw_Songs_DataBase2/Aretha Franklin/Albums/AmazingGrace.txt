// Mary Don't You Weep //

Oh Oh Mary
Oh Oh Mary

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn.
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. 

Well, Satan got mad and he knows I'm glad. 
Missed that soul that he thought he had.
Now, didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep.

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn.
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. 

Well, one of these nights around twelve o'clock, 
This old town's gonna really rock.
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep.

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn.
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. 

Cheer up, sisters and don't you cry. 
There'll be good times bye and bye.
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep.

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn.
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep. 

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn.
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn. 
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned? 
Oh, Mary, don't you weep.

// Precious Lord, Take My Hand / You've Got A Friend //

When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend

// What A Friend We Have In Jesus //

What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh what peace we often forfeit,
Oh what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In his arms he'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

// Amazing Grace //

Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.

// Precious Memories //

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere.

As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul.

// Remarks By Reverend C.l. Franklin //

Aretha and to all of the musicians in this great choir
That took me all the way back to the living room at home
When she was about 6 and 7 years of age
I saw you cry
And I saw you respond
But I was just about to bust wide open
You talk about being moved

Not only because Aretha, my daughter, Aretha is just a strong singer
Reverend James Cleveland knows about those things
When James came to prepare Aqua for a gospel broadcast
Which is still in existence
And he and Aretha used to go in the living room
And spend hours in there
Singing different songs
She's influenced greatly by James
If you wanna know the truth
She ain't never left the truth

// God Will Take Care Of You //

Be not dismayed whatever betide you, you need to know
(God will take care of you)
Beneath His wings of love abide you, you need to know
(God will take care of you)
Through days of toil when heart does fail
When dangers fierce your path assail, you better remember

[Chorus:]
God will take care of you,
Through every day (through every day)
All of the way
God will take care of you; He will take care of you

All you may need (all you may need) He will provide,
(God will take care of you)
Nothing you ask, my friend, will be denied,
(God will take care of you)

No matter what (no matter what)
May be the test (may be the test)
Lean, weary one (lean, weary one)
Safe in his rest (safe in his rest)
And you just remember that you know

[Chorus]

Through your trials and through your storms
When it seems you can't hold on
Trouble is on ever side, cried so much you just can't cry no more
They can talk about you, laugh about you, say that it's over
But it's not over until God says it's over
Remember that he is always faithful
You serve a God who's able to take care of you

[Chorus x2]

// You'll Never Walk Alone //

When you walk through a storm, 
Hold your head up high, 
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of the storm, 
Is the golden sky, 
And the sweet silver song of the lark.

Walk on through the wind, 
Walk on through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown,
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
And you'll never walk alone, 
You'll never walk alone.

// Never Grow Old //

I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul;
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never grow old.

[Chorus:]
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where we'll never grow old;
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where we'll never grow old.

In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by;
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never shall die.

[Chorus]

When our work here is done and the life crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o'er;
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend,
With the loved ones who've gone on before.
