// Oh Me, Oh My (I'm A Fool For You Baby) //

To make you laugh, I would be a fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I really don't care
I would give my everything to keep you, boy
It breaks my heart when you?ve not there

I'll stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger size
And although I ain't got no tune
My show ain't gonna fly
I'll find the music there in your eyes

Oh me, oh my, I'm a fool for you baby (baby now)
(Fool for you) Oh me oh my (I)
I am crazy (crazy baby)
Oh me, oh my (me oh my)
Yeah I'm a fool for ya baby
C'mon let your love light shine on me
(Shine on me)

We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
And then we'll take a magic carpet ride
Yes we will
And we'll tell our smokey friend, hey don't you forget
Because you've got to keep us side by side, yeah

Oh me, oh my (oh me, oh my)
I am a fool for ya baby (be your)
(Your fool for ya)
Oh me, oh my, (I)
You know that I am (crazy) crazy baby
(Crazy baby) yes you do (crazy baby)
Oh me, oh my (oh me, oh my)
Whoa-oh I'm a fool (fool) for ya baby
(Need your)
Come on let your love light shine on me
(Shine on me)
Would you do that? (on me)
Come on let your love light shine
Just alittle bit (shine) right on me

Oh lover let your love light
Shine on me (shine on me)
Oh hear me now!
Oh me, me oh my
I'm a fool oh! for ya baby (now)

Oh me oh my (I)
You know that I'm cra-a-azy baby
(Crazy baby)
Oh me, oh my...

// Day Dreaming //

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you

Look at my mind floating away

He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go some place, huh?
Where? I don't care."

He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
Entrust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part

I wanna be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it

I'm lovin' him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say,

"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care.
Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care."

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' loved starved
I'll be there to feed it

Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say,

"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care.
Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care."

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you

Look at my mind floating away

Daydreaming
Thinking of you
Daydreaming
Thinking of you

// All The King's Horses //

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
I woke up this mornin' that this is what I found.
You had gone and left me,
Any you never even made a farewell sound.

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
I asked my friends about you and this is what they said,
"She can live without you, 
She's gonna find a man with money instead."

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
Someday you will know, the meaning of a love that's true.
But when you find out I won't be around to share it with you.

All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again.

// A Brand New Me //

This is my same old coat, these are my same old shoes;
It was the same old me, with the same old blues...
Oh, then you touched my life just by holding my hand,
And when I look in the mirror, I see a brand new girl, oh, man!

Just because of you, boy;
Just because of you... whoa, oh, oh...
Just because of you, boy;
Just because of you...

I got the same old friends, and they've got the same old sins;
I tell them the same old jokes, and I get the same old grins...
But now the joke is on you - It happened somehow with you;
Everyday of my life, I'm as fresh as morning dew!

Just because of you, (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, whoa, oh, oh, oh...
Just because of you, boy, (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you...

I go to the same old places, I see the same old faces;
I look at the same old sky, see it all in a brand new light...
I got a brand new boy, and I got me a brand new smile;
Since I found you, baby, I got me a brand new style!

Just because of you, boy! (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! I feel good...
Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! I feel good...

Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Hey! Just because of you! Yes, I do...
Just because of you, boy... (Just because of you, boy...)
Just because of you, oh! It feels good...

Just because of you, boy, yeah, just because of you, ah...
Just because of you, boy, just because, because, because of you...

(Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...
Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...
Just because of you, boy... Ooh! Boy...)

// April Fools //

(April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools...
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools...)

In an April dream, once you came to me,
You smiled, I looked into your eyes, and I knew I'd be loving you, and,
Then you touched my hand, and I knew April dreams could come true...

Are we just April fools, who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? I don't care, true love has found us now... 
(April fool, true love's found us now...)
Whoo! Yes, it has!
(April fool, true love's found us now...)
Uh-huh...

Little did we know where the road would lead;
Here we are, a million miles away from the past, travelin' so fast, and,
There is no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last...

Are we just April fools, who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? I don't care, true love has found us now... 
(April fool, true love's found us now...) Yes, it has!
(April fool, true love's found us now...)
(April fool, true love's found us now...) Yes, it has!
(April fool, true love's found us now...)

Little did we know where the road would lead;
Here we are, a million miles away from the past, traveling so fast, and,
There is no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last...

Are we just April fools, who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? I don't care, ooh-ooh, true love has found us now!
(April fool, true love's found us now...) Whoo!

// I've Been Loving You Too Long //

I've been loving you too long to stop now

You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
Oh, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you oh, too long
I don't want to stop now, oh, oh, oh

I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh, oh, oh
And don't make me stop now
Oh baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now

I love you, I love you, I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please don't make me stop now
Talkin' 'bout heart and soul
That I love you
I love you

// First Snow In Kokomo //

The first snow in Kokomo...
Off an Indiana highway, I was on my way to Kokomo...

A funny friend named Chuck slipped and bumped his head (ooooops!),
And as we picked him up, asked us had his nose turned red...
That was the first snow in Kokomo...

Kenny learning to blow his horn...
I was feeling right up to it;
Could it be done? Yes, I could do it...
That first snow in Kokomo...

Jimmy Dee playing a bass he was learning to play;
Applegate discovered a coronet, almost right away...
Reggie expecting a baby, and was Freddie kinda blue!
That was the first snow in Kokomo...

Jimmy Dee has put his bass away (put away),
And I wonder if Applegate ever learned to play?
Kenny is really, really blowing his horn, 
And a baby named Moishe has been born... (Pretty little baby...)
Freddie's getting ready to make things right... (Right on, Freddie!)
Since that first snow, that first snow in Kokomo...

(First snow in Kokomo...)
(The first snow in Kokomo...)

// The Long And Winding Road //

The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

// Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time) //

I gave my heart and soul to you, girl
Now didn't I do it, baby didn't I do it baby
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh
Didn't I do it, baby didn't I do it baby

I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Yes sir

I thought that heart of yours was true, girl
Now, didn't I think it baby didn't I think it baby
But this time I'm really leavin' you girl oh
Hope you know it baby hope you know it baby

Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I
Yes sir

(Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it baby)
(Didn't I do it baby didn't I do it baby)

Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (oh)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Hoo
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Can't you see)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Ooh baby, ooh)

Girl, can we talk for a second
I know it's been a long time
Since some someone's blown your mind, like I did
There'll be other times, for me and you
And I can see the tears fallin' from your eyes

Tell me girl, did I blow your mind

Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Did I blow your mind baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

// Border Song (Holy Moses) //

Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he was been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived, yes, I have

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't been abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes, I have

Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, can we live in peace
Let us try to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man standing over there
What's his color do you care
Holy Moses, can we live in peace

Holy Moses, can we live in peace
Holy Moses, can we live in
I wonder can we live in peace
