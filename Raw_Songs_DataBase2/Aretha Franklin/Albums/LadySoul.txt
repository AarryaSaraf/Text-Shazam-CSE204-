For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out
I'm just a link in your chain

You got me where you want me
I ain't nothin' but your fool
Ya treated me mean
Oh you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

Every chain, has got a weak link
I might be weak yeah
But I'll give you strength
Oh, hey

You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "Come on home"
My doctor said, "Take it easy"
Oh but your lovin' is much too strong
I'm added to your

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chai-i-in
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh hey

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chai-i-in
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

Chain, chain, chai-i-in
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chai-i-in
Chain of fools

// Money Won't Change You //

Told my darling that I had to go
It's your body, I don't care no more
Although you had me, time to get along
Money won't change you

I momey won't change you...
But time will take your own do


Then you know how to be treated just like dirt
Hold me, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman, my only girl

Money won't change you, money won't change you...
But time will take your own do

I know you're happy now that you're gone
Money won't change you
I said money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you own

I said, put a smile as good as gold
But that smile now can't be sold
You said, baby, that you had to go
Back to somebody, I don't care no more
Told your friends I was a fool
The trouble's, woman, that you've got to go through
Other lover won't take me home
I have a...
Even in the street, even in the car too
Mashed potatoes and boogaloo
C'mon baby and let yourself go...
It's your body, I don't care no more
C'mon baby, c'mon baby, everybody, everybody
Need your hand, need your hand
Let me tell you I, I, I...
I'm down so long...

// People Get Ready //

I believe
I believe
I believe
I do believe

People get ready, there's a train comin' (ooh)
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All we need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
You don't need no ticket, well just thank the Lord
(Thank the Lord)

People get ready, for the train to Jordan
It's picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among His loved the most

I believe
I believe
I believe
I do believe

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner (sinner)
Whom would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there is no hiding place against the kingdom's throne
There is no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

So people get ready, there's a train comin'
You don't need no ticket, we'll just get on board
All you need is faith, yeah, to hear those diesels hummin'
You don't need no baggage, you just thank the Lord

Oh, we'll just thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Thank the Lord

You don't need no ticket, we'll just thank the Lord
I said, we'll just thank the Lord
Thank the Lord
Thank the Lord

(Get on board)
I'll thank You because I need You

// (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman //

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along, to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

Oh, baby, what you done to me?
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

// Since You've Been Gone //

Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby,
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone, baby
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)

[Bridge]

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips,
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now
(Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(Hear me)
Got to get you back somehow
(Hear me now)
I'm trying
Take me back,
Consider me please
If you walk in that door,
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Well I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
I've been so lonely
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Baby baby baby been so lonely
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)

// Good To Me As I Am To You //

If you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder, could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine?

Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns
Then, my friend, you've used my dimes

If there's water in the pitcher
And we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darling
I'd need less water than you'd think

My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh, yeah
Listen to this

Some people want
But they don't wanna give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of loving me

Starting today
Tomorrow and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door

Baby
I want you to be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo, baby
I don't think that's asking you too much to do

Listen
Don't you walk around here
Feeling like you can treat me any ol' way
Using my love, my time, my heart
Day, day after day

Oh baby, baby
Be as good to me as I am to you
Whoo, whoo
Baby

// Come Back Baby //

Oh come back, baby
Oh baby please dont go, yeah
'Cause the way I love you
You'll never know

Come back baby
Let's talk it over
Yeah, one more time, oh yeah

Well I admit, baby
That I was wrong
Don't you know, baby
You been gone too long

Come back baby
Let's talk it over
Yeah, yeah, one more time
Oh yeah

One of these days, baby
And It won't be long, yeah
You gonna look for me child you know
And I'll be gone

So come back baby, yeah yeah
Let's talk it over
One more, one more, one more time
One more time

Say If I could holler
Like a mountain jack
Yeah yeah oh people
I'd call my baby back

Come back baby
Let's talk it over
Oh, one more time
Yeah, one more time, hey

Come back baby
Let's talk it over
Oh, one more time
Yeah, one more time, hey

One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time

// Groovin' //

Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Instead of groovin'

Groovin'
On a crowded avenue
Groovin'
Anything we like to do

There ain't no place I'd rather be
Imagine all the people that we'd like to see

Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon

Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin'
I couldn't get away too soon, baby

Oh darling, you send me
You
You
