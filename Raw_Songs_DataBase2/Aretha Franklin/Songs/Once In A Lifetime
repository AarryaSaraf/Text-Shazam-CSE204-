Just once in a lifetime
A woman knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes her hand
And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore a new and exciting land
Just once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
As though I had wings
For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in a lifetime
I'm gonna do great things

Just once, once in my lifetime
Ooh, I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
Just as though I had wings
For this, this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in my lifetime
I'm gonna do great things
I'm gonna do real things
I'm gonna do real big things
Real, big, things
