Here comes, here comes Lee Cross
Here he comes, here comes Lee Cross
He's a trouble maker (trouble maker)
A heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
A love maker (love maker)

Let me tell you about Lee Cross
Gonna tell the story, he's the lady's boss
The ex-teacher from the school of live
He's a lover so prim, a young girl's dream
Mad on who wants to be his wife

You think I'm lying about he's being a lover
His record speaks for itself
Don't worry about him running out, girls
If got a rose up being on the shelf

He's got a weld of kisses, honey, tell the story
And in his chest is where the love is stored
And before he turns twenty-one
He is gonna be charming of the lover's gone, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm talking 'bout Lee Cross
The great greater loss
And now that you, you've heard my spill
Wherever you're from and if he's in your town
Go on over girls and let him give you a thrill

Talking 'bout Lee, Lee Cross, he's a lover
And every girl knows that he is all friends
Well, and I, I declare that he's awfull in his charm (yes he is)
The light stars at the very end

There he goes, there goes Lee Cross
There he goes, there goes Lee Cross
He's a trouble maker (trouble maker)
A heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
A love maker (love maker)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
A love maker (love maker)
A known shaker (known shaker)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
