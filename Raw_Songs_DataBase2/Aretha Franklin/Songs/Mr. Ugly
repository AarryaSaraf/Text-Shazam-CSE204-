Haunt my house Mr. Ugly
I know how beautiful you are
When you hold me tight
Rainbow spill the night
Tell me, are you my lucky star?

Play your guitar, my Mr. Ugly
Your melodies are so divine
Winter is spring to me
When you sing to me
You serenade this heart of mine

You don't scare me, just to look at you
I'd crawl across the great divide
Although you're small
To me you're so tall
When you kiss me my heart's open wide, oh, wide

Oh, don't make me cry, my Mr. Ugly
Cling to me, never, never, ever let me go
Make my live complete
Dance me off my feet
Tell me the things I need to know
Mr. Ugly you're, you're not ugly to me anymore
