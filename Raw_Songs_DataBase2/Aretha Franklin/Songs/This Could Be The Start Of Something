You're walking along the street or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking in someone's eyes and suddenly realize
This could be the start of something big
You're lunching at twenty-one's and watching your diet
Declining a Charlotte Russe, accepting a fig
When out of the clear blue sky, suddenly it's gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate, my friend
Let him in without a second look

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or else at Malibu alone on the sand
Suddenly hear a bell, suddenly you can tell
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something big
Oh, this could be the start of something big
