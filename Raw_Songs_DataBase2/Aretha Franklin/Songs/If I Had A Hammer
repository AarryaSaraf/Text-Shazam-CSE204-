If I had a hammer
I'd swing it in the morning
Swing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd swing out a warning
Then swing out danger
And the love I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, ooh yeah

If I had a bell
Well, I'd ring that bell in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
Then sing out a warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All, all over this land, yes, I will

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
Sing it in the evening
All over this land
See me hammer out my justice
See me ring out my warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, yes, I would

All over this land, woo, yes, I would
All over this land, ooh hoo hoo, yes, I would
All over this land
All over this land
All over this land
