More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more

More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'd be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could, no one else could love you
No one else could, no one else could love you more
No one else could love you more
No one else could love you, love you more
No one else could love you more, no no
No one else could love you, no no
No one else could love you, no no
Now that's a fade
