Here we all work, on one jar or another
Why should I work while he rolls blaze?
I get tired, so tired and weary
Got to keep tolling day by day

Ol' man river, ol' man river
He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, ah ah

No, he don't plant cotton, he don't plant taters
Them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along

Well, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along

Well, you, you and me, we sweat and strain
Our bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Oh, tote that barge, you better lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary, so sick of tryin'
Tired of livin', but afraid of dyin'
Ol' man river, he keeps on rollin' along
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along, yeah
Ol' man river keeps on rollin' along
