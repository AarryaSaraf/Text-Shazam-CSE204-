I think the sky is blue
Just as far as I can see
But should you say the sky is gray
Well, it still looks blue to me
I know the road is light
And I've known this all along
But should you say the sky is gray
Then I won't say that you're wrong

Because today, I love everybody
Everybody I see
Today, I think that all folks are great and
Everybody here loves me
Ooh, today, I'd give almost anybody
Anything that I've got
Today, I'd state all folks are great
Including them that are not

Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This glorious thing
This marvelous thing

Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks great and
Everybody here loves me

Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This, this glorious thing
This marvelous thing

Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks are great and
And everybody here loves
Everybody here loves
Everybody here loves me
