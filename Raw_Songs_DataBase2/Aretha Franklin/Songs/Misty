Ooh look, just look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
Why I get misty, holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or is it the sound of your hello dear
That music I hear
Ooh, why I get misty whenever you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just, just what I want you to do
Can I help it, how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And on my own, said on my very own
Woo, that I wander through this great big wide world all alone
Never knowing my right hand from my left
My hat from my glove
Ooh, I'm too misty, too much in love
Ooh, I say I'm just too misty
Very, very, very much in love
