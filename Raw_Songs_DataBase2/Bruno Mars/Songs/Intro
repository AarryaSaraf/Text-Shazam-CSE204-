One, two, three, four!


Who y'all came to see tonight?
Who gon' get the ladies feeling something? (Who)
We gon' lock this groove in tight 
(Yeah, huh, well lock it in then!)
Don't have us lock groove down for nothing (Get down!)


Oh, oh
Lock, lemme got
Whatcha came to see? (Woo!)
Oh, oh (Where we at?)


It's about that time to get out your seats and make some noise for our host
Give it up for Bootsy Collins!

Well alright!
It is I, Blaster of the Universe 
(Blaster of the Universe)
Bootzilla himself
Fellas, I hope you got something in your cup
And ladies? Don't be afraid to make your way to the stage
For a band that I name... Silk Sonic!
