Album: Brotherhood

// Paradise //

If we left this town, we could walk the earth together

If you let me down, I will live in you forever

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you


If we could find a home, we could go through time together

If we could hold our own, devastate the night forever

There's no place where we can't go

There's no place where I have been

There's no limit I can show

There's no level inbetween

Jolene, I could have seen you there,

Jolene, I need you everywhere

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

Jolene, I could have seen you there

When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere

There's no place where you can hide

There's no place that I can't find

There's no end to leave me clean

There's no reason I have seen


If you find me on my own, you could live your life forever

Shall we leave our world alone, maybe we'll go back or never

Jolene, I could've seen you there

When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you


I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

// Weirdo //

The other day I came across

Someone I knew and he was lost

I don't care what we have done

You never will believe it

It's a life that's made for me

Where I can be completely free

So long as I obey this sound

That echoes all around

Just like the ocean or the sea

Just like the blood that burns in me

Someone like you cannot be free

Just like a lock without a key

Just like the ocean or the sea

Just like the blood that burns in me

Someone like you cannot be free

Just like a lock without a key


Just like the ocean or the sea

Just like the blood that burns in me

Someone like you cannot be free

Just like a lock without a key

Just like the ocean or the sea

Just like the blood that burns in me

Someone like you cannot be free

Just like a lock without a key


So, I thought this cannot be

There's someone else in here with me

I don't care where we have been

You never will believe it

I know you and you know me

And we're as happy as we can be

I know where this world belongs

It don't mean much to me

Just like the ocean or the sea

Just like the blood that burns in me

Someone like you cannot be free

Just like a lock without a key

// As It Is When It Was //

I've kept my head against the wall

I've been this way for so long now

You weren't exactly falling over yourself

When last I saw you

Well I always thought

We'd get along like a house on fire

Until you told me that I'd have to go

How can someone like you work that slow


Whatever you think of me

You listen hard and I will make you see

Whatever you think of me

You listen hard and I will make you see


I don't feel anything no more

This state of grace is consuming me

I'm not grown up and I am not a boy

I feel no pain and I feel no joy

Well I always thought

We'd get along like a house on fire

In those days when the sun was warm

I ran in the street where I was born


Whatever you think of me

You listen hard and I will make you see

Whatever you think of me

You listen hard and I will make you see


The streets are so empty at this time of night

I'd rather walk on my own than fight

In a world where I'd forgotten you

I found myself forgotten, too

That's the danger of believing books

And all the lies of those thieves and crooks

We sing intellectual songs of love

From a stolen pen to a velvet glove.

// Broken Promise //

Oh I don't know why people lie
And I don't know why people die
Every time I see you, you shout at me
'Cause of all the things in the world that I can't see
But what I think goes on in this world
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn
There's a fire in life where we will burn

And I never could believe it
And I never could be true
For the things that mean so much to me
Don't mean that much to you
And I never could believe
The way you told me I was wrong
If I'm right and you are sinful
Then for God's sake I was wrong

Oh, I don't know how I think this way,
And yet you sit there looking at me all day
There's more to you than I can see
There's a shadow of another hanging over me
But what I think goes on in this world
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn
There's a fire in life where we will burn

And I never could believe it
And I never could be true
For the things that mean so much to me
Don't mean that much to you
And I never could believe
The way you told me I was wrong
If I'm right and if you're sinful
Then for God's sake I was wrong

Oh, I'd tear you out of heaven
And I'd tear you out of hell
And I'd see your life in ruins
Because mine lies there as well
And I'd cry out in my loneliness
While you sleep in your peace
But you'll never see my face again
While I need words like these

// Way Of Life //

You told me about yourself,

How you once lived with someone else

The way of life that you had tried

The way they hurt you deep inside

That's the only thing about it

I can't find anyone to doubt it

That's the only thing about it

I can't find anyone to doubt it

Who do you think you're talking to?

When I look at you I know you're lying

All you say and do

Seems to fall apart and leave you crying


But I thought I could've seen you here today

But you leave me standing each and every way

You told me a pack of lies

That I can't even reason with

Failure of your moral code

The kind of things that I can't give

That's the only thing about it

I can't find anyone to doubt it

That's the only thing about it

I can't find anyone to doubt it

Who do you think you're talking to?

When I look at you I know you're lying

All you say and do

Seems to fall apart and leave you crying


Who do you think you're talking to?

When I look at you I know you're lying

All you say and do

Seems to fall apart and leave you crying

// All Day Long //

This is a song about an innocent

Who died at the hands of a desperate man

He trusted those who he thought he knew

He trusted those who he looked up to

I'll never forget the joy in his face

He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place

He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild

I used to scream and shout all day long


Now I hope you know this song

Is about a child who now has gone

And other children like him, too

Abused and used by what adults do

So don't tell me about politics

Or all the problems of our economics

When you can't look after what you can't own

You scream and shout all day long

// Angel Dust //

What shall I say

I fear you will betray me

How many ways

Can you prolong this tragedy

Who told you that I would be back

You came here to seize my freedom

I will send you falling slowly

To the earth I see below me


You never knew

With open arms I came to you

Judging me so safe to be with

Mistakes you made that you can't live with

What you get is what you need

When you watch the blood but you don't bleed

You make me feel like a masked delusion

A man whose life's became illusion

// Every Little Counts //

Every second counts

When I am with you

I think you are a pig

You should be in a zoo

I guess I should've known

I'd end up on my own

Every second counts when I am with you

Every second counts


Every little counts

When I am with you

You make me feel so good

I never felt so new

I saw you long ago

Though you never let it show

Every little counts when I am with you


Every little counts when I am with you


Every second counts

When I am with you

Even though you're stupid

I still follow you

The smile upon your face,

It always stays in place

Every second counts when I am with you


Every second counts when I am with you

Every second...
