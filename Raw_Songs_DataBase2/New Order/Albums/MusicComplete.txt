// Restless //

What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

But how much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
How much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?

I want a nice car
A girlfriend
Who's as pretty as a star
I want respect
As much, as much as I can get

Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words

I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

Due to current studies
The fiscal climate isn't looking good
Get out of town
The streets are running rivers full of blood

The more I see
The less, the less that I believe
The more I hear
The less, the less that I perceive

Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words

I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

Restless
I am so restless
And this changing world
Leaves me speechless

I am lost for words
But I kept my nerve
But it's not hopeless
If you take rest

// Singularity //

Winter came so soon
And summer never happened
We're players on a stage
With roles already scripted
We're working for a wage
We're living for today
On a giant piece of dirt
Spinning in the universe

I can hear your cry out there
And I can feel you close to me

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
Friends, not here
We shared our tears

And all I wanna do
Is make the right impression
The instrument of truth
A soldier with no weapon
I care so much for you
I crawled a thousand miles
Through deserts full of sand
My love in every land

I can feel your cry out there
And I can feel you everywhere

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
We're all lost souls
Who can't come home
The Friend's not here
We shared our tears

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
Friends, not here
We shed our tears

I can feel your presence here
Tender softly through the air

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers lips
We're all lost souls
We can't come home

// Plastic //

Got a feeling in my head
Feels like thunder overhead
Intoxicated, can't stop the flow
This love is poison, but it's like gold

Give me direction out of the fold
Show me affection, I'll sell ya' my soul

It's official, you're fantastic
You're so special (so special), so iconic (so iconic)
You're the focus (the focus), of attention (attention)
But you don't want it (you don't want it), cause you're so honest

If you break me, will you fix me?
And if I'm missing, will you miss me?
I'll regret it til' the day I die
Until you knew it was in my head

Feels like thunder, it's getting cold
This love is poison, but it's like gold

It's official, you're fantastic
You're so special (so special), so iconic (so iconic)
You're the focus (the focus), of attention (attention)
But you don't want it (you don't want it), cause you're so honest (you don't want it)

You don't want it

It's official, you're fantastic
You're so special (so special), so iconic (so iconic)
You're the focus (the focus), of attention (attention)
But you don't want it (you don't want it), cause you're so honest (you don't want it)

One of these days, one of these days
Right when you want me, baby, I'll be gone
Cause you're like plastic, you're artificial
You don't mean nothing, baby, so superficial

// Tutti Frutti //

[Spoken intro in Italian:]
Tutti frutti
Amore mio
Tutti frutti
No
Non è ancora il momento di entrare. 
Non è ancora il momento di…

Life is so crazy these days
I don't know how to adjust
Are we the master or slave?
Do we need passion or lust?

Are we just caught in the days
So many words in a phrase
Life is so crazy these days [x2]

[Chorus - Bernard Sumner & Elly Jackson:]
You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go
Cause you're that girl

Tutti Frutti

I had a beautiful dream
For a picture so serene
But I don't know what it means - love
I just want your love

Generation's lost in space
Trying to find the human race
We're living in a state of grace
Where every scholar means a dollar

And sometimes I just can't go on
I feel like I'm a setting sun
I know my eyes are burning bright
I just need you to make it right

[Chorus - Bernard Sumner & Elly Jackson:]
You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

Tutti Frutti

[Chorus - Elly Jackson:]
You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

[Chorus - Bernard Sumner & Elly Jackson:]
You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

Whenever I feel low [x3]
Cause you're that girl

Tutti Frutti

Non mi interessa il nome vero. 
Non mi interessa la vita reale. 
Quella canzone. 
E tu? 
Sei tutti i frutti.

// People On The High Line //

If you love me in the night
I will come and make it right
I need your love, I want your love
When you're not there, I think of us
We're like the sun, we're burning bright
We've gotta try to get it right
I need your love, I want it now
We've got to make it work somehow

I'll keep trying
It's all gonna be alright
This time we'll get it right
I'll keep trying
I can't get any higher
There's nothing I desire

The ghost of you is in my heart
Sometimes it feels we're worlds apart
I look back to the day we met
When first you got inside my head
I need your love, I need your love
It's everywhere and it's for us
If you love me in the night
I'll come to you, I'll make it right

I'll keep trying
It's all gonna be alright
This time we'll get it right
I'll keep trying
I can't get any higher
There's nothing I desire

I'll keep trying
It's all gonna be alright
So come with me tonight
I'll keep trying
I can't get any higher
There's nothing I desire

This time I thought
It would be instrumental
I'll keep trying
I'd open the door
I've been here before
And here I stand
I'm a shadow of a man without your love
I'll keep trying

// Stray Dog //

The secret of our happiness is unconditional love
I just wanted to make her smile
And make it last for a while
Do all the things you can do at home
Maybe once in a while get away somewhere special
Create a memory that would last forever
In those days we spent together

They say the secret of our happiness is unconditional love
And brotherhood and trying to be good and trying not to drink
But I can't stop drinking, it's in my blood
In and out of trouble, while keeping yourself alive
Not giving cold down in the wastes of the grim and mire
In the dark and the sun of the mire

Not getting wasted, not being a cheat, a killer or a liar
Not getting pulled down in the wastes of the mire
In the darkness of the mire, in the darkness of the mire
I'd rather be a lover than a liar
I'd rather be a lover than a supplier

If the secret of happiness is unconditional love
Why don't you miss me?
Well, sometimes I do, like when you're away
And I feel a need for you
I feel it like the day we met all those years ago
Those times were hard to hold on to
But nothing stays the same
We are forever moving, like the dancing of the flame
Life is so unstable, always changing, it never stays the same
Like the atom and that bomb that causes so much pain
So I came in from the cold with nowhere left to go
And I gave away my freedom and the calling of the wild
So that I could be with you, I chose to be with you
So I came in from the cold and I chose to be with you
I chose
To be (growls)
With you

(Growls, hisses, snarls)
Chose to be with you

// Academic //

There was a time my world belong with you
But I was so misguided in our youth
I couldn't help but drink this poison brew
You had a strange perception of the truth

Oh, baby, I remember you 
'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea
The tempest rise, it stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony

I was aware that danger lay ahead
And I couldn't bare this stranger in my head
Well, you've got a face (you've got a face)
Well, you've got a soul
Oh, he ain't got nothing
Not even our hope
I give it a try a long time ago
And your face was designed
But you didn't know

Oh, baby, I remember you

'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never see or hear the crashing of the sea
The tempest rise, it stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony

'Cause your heart is cold
And your blood runs dry
You'll never hear or feel the crashing of the sea
The tempest rise, that stops all time
When lovers eyes are locked in harmony

// Nothing But A Fool //

I saw her face
In a dream last night
And it hurt so much
Yes, it hurt so much
She was in my mind
As I drank my wine
And now I count the costs
Of the one I lost
She went away
To a different place
And she was never to return
Whatever happened to that girl?

Sometimes you don't know what you've got
You think you're better than the rest
And the world belongs to you
But you're nothing but a fool
If you can hold her in your hands
If you can feel her in your heart
Don't ever let her run away
Don't ever let her drift away
Cause it will break you later on
When you're left there on your own
Don't ever let her slip away
Don't ever let her drift away

It's a crying shame
It caused so much pain
It's sad that way
It was me that day
Cause I turned you away
Like I didn't know who you were
I was such a fool
I was so cruel
And the years went by
And without a word of lie
I still love you
But what can I do?

Hold her in your hand
Feel her in your heart
Don't ever let her drift away (let her drift away)

Hold her in your hand
Feel her in your heart
Don't ever let her drift away (let her drift away)

// Unlearn This Hatred //

Heartache [x16]

Two steps forward, and one step back
Two steps forward, and one step back

Unlearn this hatred, you got to keep it true
It's not that dated, but let's not pretend it's new
Go, you got to take it when I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I'm now a fan of you

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait

You're the prey and I'm the hunter, every day I think of you
I'm your automatic lover, show me what I have to do in my heart
Think is your form, and I am
And it's your fate, to make me your man

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait

Unlearn this hatred, you got to keep it true
It's not that dated, but let's not pretend it's new
Go, we got to take it when I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I'm now a fan of you

Two steps forward, and one step back, meeting for your alternate
Make a sign that I can see, shoot into my frequency
Take me to another place, help mew in this human race
Maybe it's time that you got faith, for your healing I can't wait

// The Game //

How much we tried, but how we hurt?
In this empty space, in which we live
We will not have, we will not give
We're waiting for one raising kiss

It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we breathe in
It's so near, but we can't touch it
But it is here, and we love it
For life is good, and it's forever
It's in our blood, and our endeavor

Higher than the sky, taller than a man can reach
And if we break up, we are not here
These are the times in which we live [x3]

It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we breathe in
It's so near, but we can't touch it
But it is here, and we love it
For life is good, and it is special
I want more precious metal
It's not over, and it's not hopeful
For this is light and it's immortal

// Superheated //

Sometimes I wake up and the sky is grey
When you're not here by my side
I see your make up on the shelf
In a photograph of someone else
And it breaks me up like I don't exist
Did we ever love, did we ever kiss?
Do you ever listen to what I have to say?
As life unfolded that one short day

However you want it, it's my desire
Girl you've got me hanging like a bird down on a wire
We are so different, yet we're the same
Things that I remember, that I wish I could change

Sometimes I wake up as angry as hell
I feel deserted, I feel unwell
But it's not your fault, no not at all
I was the reason for our downfall
Sometimes I wake up when I'm alone
As angry as hell because you're gone

You want your life back, girl I'm not a thief
You told me that it's over and that you were gonna leave

Now that it's over [x8]
It's over, it's over, it's over
