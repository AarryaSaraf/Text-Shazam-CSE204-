Album: WaitingForTheSirensCall

// Who's Joe? //

Hey Joe what you're doing?

It seems like it's all going wrong

There's a storm in the sky passing over

And it looks like it's going to be strong

You've got eyes like an old wounded soldier

They cry tears to the losts in the wind


Hey Joe

Hey Joe

Hey Joe

What are your gonna do?


I looked for you

I'll get you home

Wherever you go

Whatever you do

I've got to find you

I've got to find you (Whatever you do)


I looked for you

I'll take you there

Wherever you go

Whatever you do

I've got to find you

Whatever I do (Whatever you do)


Hey Joe what you're doing?

They say you don't care anymore

You had your heart [hurt?] by a woman

Now it doesn't work anymore

She said that you had it coming

That you were no good from the start


Hey Joe

Hey Joe

Hey Joe

Time to go home


I looked for you

I'll get you home

Wherever you go

Whatever you do

I've got to find you

I've got to find you (Whatever you do)


I looked for you

I'll take you there

Wherever you go

Whatever you do

I've got to find you

Whatever I do (Whatever I do)

Whatever I do (Whatever I do)

Whatever I do (Whatever I do)

Whatever I do (Whatever I do)

Whatever I do (Whatever I do)

// Hey Now What You Doing //

Hey now what you doing

Don't go down the road to ruin

Look back at where you came from

Count to ten before you go wrong


You have the brightest future

Writing songs on your computer

But you couldn't walk the extra mile

And now your life is running wild


You've gotta hold your head up high

You know it's not too late to try

You've gotta lift that heavy load

You've gotta get back in control


The days you've said to me

What is it that your eyes see

Is it love or is it hate

Banging on an opened gate


Hey now, who's that with you

What's that thing I saw him give you

Turn around don't come no closer

You took it from my shoulder holster


You've gotta hold your head up high

You know it's not too late to try

You've gotta lift that heavy load

You've gotta get back in control


You've gotta hold your head up high

You know it's not too late to try

You've gotta lift that heavy load

You've gotta get back in control


Why don't you put that gun right down

Before you kill the love you found


Hey now what you doing (what you doing)

Don't go down the road to ruin

// Waiting For The Sirens' Call //

What does this ship bring to me

Far across the restless sea

Waiting for the sirens call

I've never seen it here before


There she ?? the lonely trail

Getting through the breaking winds

Drifting slowly from the coast

She is lost forever more


We all want some kind of love

But sometimes it's not enough

To the wall and through the door

With a stranger on the shore


I won't desert you

I don't know what to say

I really hurt you

I nearly gave it all the way


I've got it all

Cause you were not the one

I don't know where to turn when you're gone

When you're gone


Gotta catch the midnight train

First to Paris then to Spain

Travel with a document

All across the continent


City life is flying by

The wheels are turning all around

Get on board we can't be late

Our destination cannot wait


All the stars and all the worlds

Filling up this universe

Can never be as close as us

We never shine as bright or??


I won't desert you

I don't know what to say

I really hurt you

I nearly gave it all the way


I've got it all

Cause you were not the wrong one

I don't know where to turn when you're gone

When you're gone


I won't desert you

I don't know what to say

I really hurt you

I nearly gave it all the way


I've got it all

Cause you were not the one

I don't know where to turn when you're gone

When you're gone


How many times must I lose my way, hey

How many words do I have to say, hey

What can I do just to make you see

That you're so good for a man like

A man like me

// Krafty //

Some people get up at the break of day

Gotta go to work before it gets too late

Sitting in a car and driving down the road

It ain't the way it has to be


But that's what you do to earn your daily wage

That's the kind of world that we're living in today

Isn't where you wanna be

And isn't what you wanna do


Just give me one more day (one more day)

Give me another night (just another night)

I need a second chance (second chance)

This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)


I'll say it one last time (one last time)

I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)

I've got to change your mind (I've got to change your mind)

I'll never let you go


You've got to look at life the way it oughta be

Looking at the stars from underneath the tree

There's a world inside and a world out there

With that on tv you just don't care


They've got violence, wars and killing too

All shrunk down in a two-foot tube

But out there the world is a beautiful place

With mountains, lakes and the human race

And this is where I wanna be

And this is what I wanna do


Just give me one more day (one more day)

Give me another night (just another night)

I need a second chance (second chance)

This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)


I'll say it one last time (one last time)

I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)

I've got to change your mind (change your mind)

I'll never let you go


Just give me one more chance (one more chance)

Give me another night (just another night)

With just one more day (one more day)

Maybe we'll get it right (You know I'll get it right)


I'll say it one last time (one last time)

I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)

If I could change your mind (change your mind)

I'll never let you go

// Morning Night & Day //

One time didn't do it

Two times didn't feel quite right

I didn't know where i was going

I just knew that i would be alright


I woke up in a druken haze

The sun shone to my window?

I said that i'd never do it again

What kind of fool do you think i am?


It happens

It always seems to happen

Morning night and day

I just want some action

Give me satisfaction

Send me to my?

Morning night and day


I had a good time late last night

I didn't think it would ever end

I walked home in a broad day light

Couldn't get a cab at half past five


One drink wouldn't do it

Two drinks are far too much

I didn't know what i was doing

I ate the floor and a pile of dust


It happens

It always seems to happen

Morning night and day

I just want some action

Give me satisfaction

Send me to my?

Morning night and day


So if you think that it won't get you

Well think again friend 'cause it's not true

In my case, it was not my fault

Other people made that call


One time didn't do it

Two times didn't feel quite right


It happens

It always seems to happen

No matter what i say

Morning night and day

I just want some action

Need some satisfaction

Before it gets too late

Send me to my?

Morning night and day

// Jetstream //

(It's only one more day)


Can you wait

My plane will be arriving shortly

Right there at the gate

I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me


This time could be what

We've both been searching for

Our whole lives waking up

And coming back for more


(Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight)


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


We're so high

I'm watching all the clouds stripped by below me

We should try

It's been so long since I made you cry


Long-Live-Love

I just can't get enough of you

I need that engines pushed

It's gonna take me home to you


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


You were meant to be

Home with me


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


J-E-T (J-E-T)

You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are my jetstream lover

You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)


You are so good for me (You are so good for me)

You are so good for me (Just how I wanna be baby)


But you're gone

But you're gone

Don't let it go

Don't let it go

If you don't try

If you don't try

How will you know

How will you know

// Guilt Is A Useless Emotion //

Just another day in the week
Waiting for an opportunity to step in front of me
Maybe I'm losing my mind
Searching for another place in another time

Real love can't be bought
It is wild and it can't be cought
Real love can't be sold
It's another color than gold

(I need your love) I just wanna buy it
(I need your love) Will you help me find it
(I want your love) How can you deny it
(I need your love) You've just gotta try it
(I want you now) Something that you gotta know
(I need you now) My love for you I wanna show
(I want your love) I'm telling you that I belong
(I need your love) You and me just can't go wrong

Standing on top of the world
Thinking at the joy you bring when you do that thing to me
You sure know a lot for a girl
You can bring the good times back get me on the track

Real love can't be bought
It is wild and it can't be cought
Real love can't be sold
It's another color than gold

I need your love) I just wanna buy it
(I need your love) Will you help me find it
(I want your love) How can you deny it
(I need your love) You've just gotta try it
(I want you now) Something that you gotta know
(I need you now) My love for you I wanna show
(I want your love) I'm telling you that I belong
(I need your love) You and me just can't go wrong

(I need your love)
(I need your love)
(I need your love)
(I need your love)

(I need your love) I just wanna buy it
(I need your love) Will you help me find it
(I want your love) How can you deny it
(I need your love) You've just gotta try it
(I want you now) Something that you gotta know
(I need you now) My love for you I wanna show
(I want your love) I'm telling you that I belong
(I need your love) You and me just can't go wrong

You and me just can't go wrong
You and me just can't go wrong
You and me just can't go wrong
You and me just can't go wrong

// Turn //

It's a hard way to come home
You've got me on my knees
The walls are tumbling down
They're falling like the leaves

Days turn into months and years
I can't forget that you were here
I feel your presence everywhere
In the corner over there

Turn your eyes from me
It's time for me to go
Across the hills and over the sea
I want you more than you know

It's a wild world out there
And nobody gives a damn
In cold blood we don't care
And we don't want to understand

I'm sitting here alone at night
My sleepless eyes are open wide
What do you want me to say
What we had has gone away

The sky is high the road is long
Show me what I should have done
What do you want me to do
Take it all away from you

Turn your eyes from me
It's time for me to go
Across the hills and over the sea
I want you more than you know

Turn your eyes from me
It's time for me to go
Across the hills and over the sea
I want you more than you know

// Working Overtime //

Who's that over there

Looks like he dont care

Almost lost his time

Too much working overtime


Gotta get up every night

Sit against an open wide

Gonna get away from here

Take that car and push that gear


You turn me in no one

He's the rising sun

He wont share no tears

Got no time to break down here, Hey!


He's going nowhere fast

Just a piece of dirty trash

All alone by himself

He dont need nobody else


Walking down the street

So much going on

People everywhere

Look at him but they dont care


See that world out there

Make it go away

You can change his mind

Too much working overtime

Hey! overtime [5x]

Overtime [4x]


He crossed that wicked line

In trouble all the time

Where did it all go wrong

Hands easy all night long


All those girls out there

Looking for the one

Do they really care

Could they just be having fun


He did all he could

Try to get it right

Somewhere he went wrong

Too much working overtime

Hey! overtime [5x]

Overtime [4x]
