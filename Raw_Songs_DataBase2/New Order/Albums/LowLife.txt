Album: LowLife

// Love Vigilantes //

Oh I've just come
From the land of the sun
From a war that must be won
In the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave
Your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades
And some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die
And I will see it soon

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door
My wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes were sore
I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand
And I saw the telegram
That said that I was a brave, brave man
But that I was dead

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home

// The Perfect Kiss //

I stood there beside myself

Thinking hard about the weather

Then came by a friend of mine

Suggested we go out together

Then I knew it from the start

This friend of mine would fall apart

Pretending not to see his gun

I said let's go out and have some fun


I know you know

We believe in a land of love

I know you know

We believe in a land of love


I have always thought about

Staying here and going out

Tonight I should have stayed at home

Playing with my pleasure zone

He has always been so strange

I'd often thought he was deranged

Pretending not to see his gun

I said let's go out and have some fun


I know you know

We believe in a land of love

I know you know

We believe in a land of love

// This Time Of Night //

We all feel the same

All pleasure nothing to gain

I've known you from the start

I've grown used to your wooden heart

Now you know my name

You search your empty brain in vain

If you don't change your ways

You'll end up here with me unraised (???)

Without you they'll never know

Without you my life won't flow

Without you they'll never show

Without you the night won't go

Without you I'm left alone

Without you I'm on my own

Without you I lay in pain

Without you I've gone insane


Now you must decide

What good's a lie when you've nothing to hide

Maps they'll never show

They're dumb like you, they never know

It's time we said goodbye

Bury your head and silence your cry

Know the feel of pain

Join our world and play our game


Without you they'll never know

Without you my life won't grow

Without you they'll never show

Without you the night won't go

Without you I'm left alone

Without you I'm on my own

Without you my life's a waste

Just for you I wrap my face

Without you I'm left alone

Without you I'm on my own

Without you I lay here in pain

Without you I've gone insane


Whatever you may think of me

Don't ever take my dignity [x4]

Whatever you may do to me

Don't crucify my dignity

// Sunrise //

I've been waiting to hear your voice for too long now

One way conversations do not work somehow

Tell me how does one get your soul in touch with the one above

When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love

I tried so hard last night you would not talk to me

I live with the fear of the few with the gift

And I know what's going to be


Why did you never speak my name in front of my family

You gave a gift that you then took away

Like you never did before

Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me

Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me

We might be your black sheep

But you forgot us a long time ago

We might be your lost sheep

But it's time you remembered us now


As we spend our days together, nothing can go wrong

No one told the truth about it because it was so strong

If you ever think of me, if you hear my name

If you read between the lines, you'll hang your head in shame

These ?? ears will never hear, the ice will never freeze

Whatever I have done for you I did because you complained


(Whatever you may think of me whatever you may say

I've lived my whole life in danger,

You've lived your life in hate)

// Sooner Than You Think //

Hello, everyone, it's nice to be here

I've come so far to see you all

I can see your deep blue eyes

They sleep beneath the open sky

Before you stands one like your brother

Swear to God he needs no other

But how can I afford to be

Here with you so carelessly

You know what you did was so unkind

You search for the life we need to find

There's right and there's wrong

And there's good and there's bad

And there's an answer to this I wish I had


Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do


Well we had a party in our hotel last night

It ended up in an awful fight

My friend left me and my heart too

I hope I don't end up like you


Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do


Your country is a wonderful place

It pales my England into disgrace

To buy a drink that is so much more reasonable

I think I'll go there when it gets seasonable

You know what you did was so unkind

You search for the life you need to find

There's right and there's wrong

And there's good and there's bad

And there's an answer to this I wish I had


Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

// Face Up //

Ever since I've seen your face

This life of mine has gone to waste

I was young and you were old

And I always knew you were cold

At the start you had a heart

But in the end you lost your friend

Can you see your own dark face?

It's dieing in a lonely place


Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you


As we get old, we lose our place

Reflecting back the world's disgrace

I feel so low, I feel so humble

Sometimes in life we take a tumble

Don't let anybody tell you that you're no good

Cause you know they would

Don't let anybody tell you what you should do

Cause it's not that way and...


Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

We were young and we were pure

And life was just an open door

I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you


You were me and I was you

This world of ours it felt brand new

You took me a little further...

I heard it all before, I've heard it all before

I can't hear it anymore

Your hair was long, your eyes was blue

Guess what I'm gonna do to you


Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

We were young and we were pure

And life was just an open door

I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought...

Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

We were young and we were pure...
