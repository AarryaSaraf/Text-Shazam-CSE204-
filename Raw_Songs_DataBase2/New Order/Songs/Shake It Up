You get up in the early morning,
You never seen a feel like you wanna.
Look up and the sky is falling,
It's just another day, call tomorrow.


Shake it up, yeah,

You can make it real if you want it.
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can turn the wheel if you want it.
I loved you like you were no other,
Shake it up, yeah,

Shake it up, yeah,

There's a little feel like your own life,
Watch you on TV like you're standing on the front line

Does it have a feel like it's real, like it's true?

Do you need it? Do you want it?

You came up on me like a piece of cake.

There's no cure like the ones hit.
