How much we tried, but how we hurt?
In this empty space, in which we live
We will not have, we will not give
We're waiting for one raising kiss

It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we breathe in
It's so near, but we can't touch it
But it is here, and we love it
For life is good, and it's forever
It's in our blood, and our endeavor

Higher than the sky, taller than a man can reach
And if we break up, we are not here
These are the times in which we live 
These are the times in which we live 
These are the times in which we live 


It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we breathe in
It's so near, but we can't touch it
But it is here, and we love it
For life is good, and it is special
I want more precious metal
It's not over, and it's not hopeful
For this is light and it's immortal
