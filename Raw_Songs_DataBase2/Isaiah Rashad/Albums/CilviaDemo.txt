// Hereditary //

[Chorus:]
8 AM in the mornin' I be sippin' on the Henny (Henny, Henny)
You been lookin' for the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one
Ain't thinkin' bout your love I be shittin' on your feelings (feelings, feelings)
And you be lovin' on the wrong one, wrong one, wrong one

My daddy taught me how to drink my pain away (pain away)
My daddy taught me how to lease somebody (somebody)
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go (load and go)
My daddy taught me you don't need nobody (nobody)
So one time for the caged bird, caged bird, caged bird
And one time for the real niggas, real niggas, real niggas
And slow dance on the Jäger, Jäger, Jäger
And one time for the little niggas, little niggas, little niggas

[Chorus]

// Webbie Flow (U Like) //

My dick I know it's, yeah, it's unfamiliar... yeah

Baby, can you sucky on my dick? I know it's big enough
Ride with a nigga from the South, I know you feel the rush
Fuckin' with a nigga, bitches rarely ever get the touch
Better feel privileged, catch another, you can hit the dust
I done grown up for my child sake, Black and Mild face
Look up loud place, never crowd place
Never skirt chase, maybe first grade, never last place
Never had brakes, pop a transmission, always had faith
Always had trace, always had James in that duplex
Hit a suplex, fuck a crew neck
$pottie solo up in that recess, never regress
Georgia peaches, grab her cheek ass
Such a slutbag, baby nut rag, never cuff that
Love a hoodrat where there's puss at
Barely have me goin' on that Sosa, I never go back
I never hit it raw again, fucking with the law again
Picking up trash on highways, never my way
Blasé blasé, sneakin' shotty, fuck a Friday
I'm with Robert, chuggin' Bombay, fuck your turn up
Fuck your turn out, we gon burn up
Fuck your mosh pit, I'm on my shit, on that Tribe shit
Got that Phife Dawg; I might bite, bitch, I'm on tablet
Scribble down, I'm rapping like Kool
Inspire all my local jokers who be quittin' that school
They be hating that job, I was hating that too
I was flipping your burger high as a bitch, but I'm cool
I think I'm blessed now, I only stress about the stress now 
Since I'm fresh now, I pull that motherfuckin' dress down (dress down, dress down)

[Chorus: singing]
... And I'm gon' testify girl
... And I'm gonna touch your thighs
... I'm gon' spend the night, girl
... You like... [7X w/ echoes]

[Outro]
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, what's it going for?" [3X]
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, all that pussy, all that-"
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, what's it going for?" [3X]
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, all that pussy..."

"10-4, 10, 10-4; hello? We got- we got a 4-2-3
We got a young man ridin' around, in a Natty Caddy, hehe
Natty Caddy, not that at all..."

Who's that creepin' through the city in that dark ass tint?
Misdemeanor on the way yo
I slide in my rimless Bentley, no tights, I'm gymnast
Bendin' blocks, my world of Legos
Now baby hold that wheel while I'm rollin' up, hopefully she old enough
to purchase that liquor, what I need from the store
She understands her selection, advance her affection
And fears my rejection, never needin' a ho
I got plans to be that nigga
I know you met him as a child; he gave you 10 bones
Don't sweat it, don't wile', be cool for a minute
'93 'til/Till be cool for Emmett
The hung soul a rapper goes rappin' those wrappin' woes up
Defyin' foes, lyin' toes, weapons on tuck
Malcolm, they tackle for belief in the movement
But Rashad got applause for releasin' the music

[Chorus:]
Now sometimes I be gettin' higher than a bitch
Smokin' all my lows, put the fire to the spliff
Whattup... (ay ay) now whattup... (ay ay)
Now I've been gettin' higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
Now whattup... (ay) 
Now whattup (ay) now whattup, whattup

Niggas steppin' in the swimmin' pool, invincible
Women I pursue get lost in this, uh
Middle of the summer's in Miami
Kembe with me, Henny, sippin' shots like I bought it for him
I'm a brown skin small waisted
I'm creeping with my ball faces, I like her titties too
I like her attitude, I like her flexible
She got a baby due, I think she bisexual
At least I hope so
I glance to that little grown man at her front door
He looking at me like I looked at pops when he come fo'
My mama as a toddler I was selfish this ain't nothin' though
I can spit a couple 22s if I want to, I save it for the tour
The allure of the gap tooth; rap toose, re-shape 'me son
Always knew he would make him something
He got schemes to smoke green and make him some, take 'em son

[Chorus]

// R.I.P. Kevin Miller //

[Chorus 4X:]
Y'all live for bitches and blunts, we live for weed and money
Y'all live for bitches and blunts, we live for weed and money (WAKE UP~!)

Alright, now if I die today, bitch my legacy is straight
I'm the best they never heard, I'm your brother, just relate
I need diamond teeth, livin' like it's 1998
Like when Percy was the king, back when Juvie was the great
Bitch this doobie is the bait, Patton taught me how to pimp
Like one day you here, then gone, that's why Chad was downin' shrimp
I've been ridin' out, since I thought my Huffy was the shit
Chattanooga pool of sharks, don't you slip and lose a limb
Slow it down, we losin' 'em, I've been on the booze again
Shit, that SOPA a livin' Hell, free Guwop if he in jail
Nigga taught me 'bout the scale, it was vivid, I was there
I was on my first offense, I hope they gon' give me bail
Screamin' "mothafuck a 12, bitches ain't shit!"
Cops ain't neither, they huntin' my people
Codeine I'm back, leanin', I cope with my demons
The best is not perfect, the rest is not worth it - WAKE UP~!

[Chorus]

Hey bitch I'm back, quit the whinin', bring it back, oochie wally
This the set, it's that mothafuckin' bet, who designed it?
This the one, how you make it out of Chat, who can fly ya?
I'm the prince, it was written in the book, Jeremiah
I got dreams, I got bitches, I got hooks, you can buy 'em
Fresh and clean, that Stankonia had me hooked as a child
Used to think my ambition was a scheme, I defy 'em
You can too, if you get up off your ass, fuckin' try it
I'm a snipe, I'm just tryna make the top fall off
On the whip, like a cannon, lollipop on y'all
Xanny ho get me high, make me feel so tall
I'm tryna keep my mental ground and so I feel for y'all
I swear my eyes be bloody red, but bitch I feel amazin'
And this is not a confrontation, that's an understatement
See this is runnin' in your house and where your momma stayin'
You spendin' doja on some pussy, you ain't concentratin' - just WAKE UP~!

[Chorus]

// Ronnie Drake //

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
So don't call me a nigga, unless you call me "my nigga"
I'm a king, O.E. be slipping, falling from my chalice
Don't mind the bumpers that be missing from my carriage
It's poorly tinted, but my women not embarrassed
I came to bury you average, you feel slighted
It's like she know that I got it, it feel like it
I real life it, I spill vices
You will like it, I promise it's trill vibing, I'm honest
Nigga ain't no getting money on that conscious shit
I'mma just load my gat on some survival shit
And when I hear they got a drought on it
I take a month out of rap and I hustle 'til I'm out of it
I got that coke flow, that heat rock
I got that old school, huddle 'til the beat box
Baby, I'm just digging in your gushy for the sweet spot
I'mma beat that, 'til that mothafuckin' beat drop

[Hook: SZA]
I got love for my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for my sisters, my women
My bitches, my strippers, my hoes

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]
Hope they don't kill you cause you black today
They only feel you when you pass away
The eulogy be so moving, we live the scenes of those movies
Conflicts in school or dope moving, it's so youthful
But if you die today, I hope you find some relief
In what a great escape, we still dodging from polices
When we make a plate, they be lying, searching in my bucket
With the straightest face, it could be eighty eight
Sometimes I wonder why we killers, why they killing us
I think we only wear a grill because they grilling us
Or how they feeling us, gotta look real and tough
Gotta keep your hands in the cart, know you stealing stuff
Came a long way from a boat and an auction
Now we got names and a vote, then a coffin
Ain't shit change but the coast we adopted
Little black children you can call me that nigga, nigga

[Hook]

// West Savannah //

[Hook]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic banging through the night
(Fall in love, through the night)
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living do or die
(Type of way, do or die)
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
(Push me, to the side)
At least, we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide
(At least, we fell in love)

[Bridge]
How you feeling baby?
How you feeling baby?
I travel... for you
I battle... for you
Cause I love, to call, your name
I travel... for you

[Verse]
Now can we fall in love while
Southernplayalistic banging through the night
And I ain't ever felt no type
Of way about this living do or die
And when they see our age they say
We're young, I'll let you push me to the side
At least, we fell in love
With something greater than debating suicide

[Hook]

// Solioquy //

I left my daddy round '97, he was lazy
Couldn't hit the grind but making babies, I'm crazy
Smoking bouquet cop it from my niggas pushing daisies
Like a romance, push a nigga buttons like a program
I been on the Jäger for a day-ger watch me slow dance
Tough as Conan this the art of barbarian
I got four white girls all Aryan
I wonder what their daddy think fuck 'em, it's a revolution
Fuck it, fuck 'em, take a break, let 'em fuck each other
I ain't your everyday normal brother, porno lover
She savin' children by the low and guzzle, what is muscle?
And I'm finessing like I'm Timmy Duncan, win you something
Immaculate, this scatter rapping, no passing my blunt
Don't you put me on freshman covers, I'm posing with lunch
Think they worthy of presence presently passing 'em up
No competing with bleachers jogging I'm running a muck
Sweet Jesus, I fuck around and need a street sweeper
Leave the bodies on the cul-de-sac, follow me the cult is back
Sippin' on that cognac and that Jim Jones
Watching movies like damn that Vince Vaughn is a funny cat
Fred Claus and the Kelly up in your closet
Belly full of smog again, ciggys just make me nauseous
Wonder how the fuck you let a nigga make you cautious
But you jamming out to fucking Marilyn and Ozzy shit
Ponzi scheme selling everybody dreams
Killer like your neighbour, I'm as nice everybody seems
We just breaking bad and my brother serving Walter White
Hope he ain't caught with that possession like a poltergeist
Momma, where the Priests at? Why we gotta lease that?
Why we can't own that? All these fed loaners
Ain't no forewarning came bombing and I'm just Vietnam
If you gon' be trippin' like a bitch, you should be a mom, see the son

// Tranquility //

[Hook]
Well, thank God for the shooter
And thank God for the leader
And think hard for a message
Blink art on pedestrians, what are you, a believer?
Tranquility for a Brutus
And hard road for a Ceasar
Well, who came from the heavens?
They killed for a blessin', they gon' do it to Jesus

[Verse 1]
Them hard streets make a militant man
Fuck a bitch, be as real as you can
Our education, they tend to say we killers again
But I'd rather give this living a chance, I'm getting patience
I wonder if the world is gon' see us, it's just niggas
They treat lyrics like I hold triggers like I make difference
Then downplay, what I'm given like I'm no different
It make me wanna move to my aunt's house
I've been on pills since a little one
Start with Advil then we level up
I wonder if my son gon' trust me, after songs so ugly
Bout his moms, ain't mean to see the world so crummy
They got Tec-9's for Jesus
So I figured that the second coming wasn't never coming
Go figure heaven is a hassle cause
They don't even want a nigga back in Africa

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Some of us fall and some of us hover
Some of us shooters and some of us lovers
I see the sum of it all, I'm running for cover
Invite you for supper, but really they hunt you
What's really 300, who's really a gangster
Was really the prey, was really in danger
I'm willing to pray, I'm feeling the angels
Is liquor the savior? This moment will contain us
And ride to the far side, I'm looking for peace
Just spread the cigar wide, a moment of ease
Hard benches for my brothers that be roaming the streets
We don't always be the leaders that they want us to be
I'm just hoping that she praying while she down on her knees
See I often treat these hoes like their fathers would be
Good Lord, my flaws, blind you, got you time for, my flaws

[Hook]

// Menthol //

[Verse 1]
She so fuckable, and she got the menthol
And Tunji brought the trees that turned my trousers into cement drawls
Sleeping on couches, only vouchers is my in-laws
He sold ten ounces, one verse is like an eight ball
Look, I seen it crystal clear, I seen a pistol near
Seen it cock back and knock caps like it's senior year
These niggas think I give a fuck, I could drink a beer
Read a magazine, hut, hut, pass interference
I've been riding clean in my bucket for a couple years
I've been pre-stressed Laurence Pucket, mothafucka, yeah
Baby hold my hand while I stumble up these fucking stairs
Know your nigga here, you still suckin', why you fucking scared?
And hoes love it when I'm high off life, cause she know
I'm getting faded, I could fuck all night
Y'all too busy popping Mollys, you could die off hype
My favorite rapper popping ollies and he rap all dyke, I know it

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
I had a couple drinks, and I wonder
If I could call you, tomorrow and borrow, your heart
See I've been stressing for a blessing
The one that would set me apart, set me apart
I got all my problems, but I no have no weed
When they say money solve 'em, I say "No, not me"
And I don't love no more, but I'll just let you be
Cause you see all my problems and you still had loved me

[Verse 2]
You cut your hair about as short as your temper, the prescription
For dementia, start slipping an elixirs make it hard to remember
As I recall it with your heart in a blender, drinks spiking
Still chilling, put your life on ice and sink like me
Actions of us, lacking the passion, but think
Righteous from pussy upon a tongue, to calling to hear my son
Thought the remedy was balling, I'm falling darling I'm done
Finna to be a workaholic, an alcoholic or somethin', I'm just calling baby

[Hook]

// Modest //

[Verse 1]
Modest, I, be in interviews, some niggas hating
Cause I play it like, I no have no clue that I'm the greatest
Tori come, sit up on this dick, I see you waiting
Need a baby cause I'm too young and wild to be the savior
Nail me to the cross and I'm just hanging
Least they left the serpeant in my fingers, I'm just smoking
Players from my city rarely make it to a poster
'less you got a warrant, what you got in that Corolla?
Oh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola
Won't let them haters get me down, that's what they told us
It's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up
We came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us
Just living a lie, OG's, acting like hoes, we couldn't rekindle the fire
Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block
I can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffing
The grass, holding my cool like a strap, look at my southerner ass

[Hook]
Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Bitch, I came right here with the bounce
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah, cause

[Verse 2]
Quiet, I be in living room, cuh, nigga shaded
With my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbating
Then bring me alone, she got something to say like Larry David
But I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby
Stuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies
Who gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this?
I got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga
But can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one
Don't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away
How you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre?
Least today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face
Just a stepping stone, least them kind of bitches know their place
This my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced
This what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass
Bitch, I came here right here with an ounce
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave

[Hook]

// Heavenly Father //

[Verse 1]
Now everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordie, give me something for my soul
See I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lucky off my dome
See I been tired of fucking all these girls
And I been tired of spending all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulders by yourself
They stole the story they tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the rough
And mama call me tell me coming home
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one who felt

[Hook]
Heavenly father why are you so far away
Heavenly father why are you so far away
Heavenly father why are you so far away
Heavenly father why are you so far away

[Verse 2]
I'm praying that I make it 25
They be calling doctors for my health
I know it's kinda hard to say the drugs
Because I been having problems with myself
I been asking questions, where the lord?
And they don't give me answers just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
Because I was busy cutting on myself
And hanging from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a rope up on your neck
And I been losing more than just my mind
Gathering whats left of self-respect
And daddy why you call me while you drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been tryna cope I'm getting weak

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I smoke too much, the problems of a 20 something
I drink too often, there's liquor pouring from the faucet
You would assume by following the tunes
And I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit and pussy is my greatest vice
I love smoking weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good
The wise men from a long line of bitch made and bridesmen
You never had nothing but fucking dreams
You just caught up in the hype
The fashion and so it seems, the limelight
I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your 2 cents and burning your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fucking mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fucking mouth
So you don't even know that I'm serious, know what im talking 'bout
So like you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And you got punch lines for days
So generic your flow
You're too cold, you're aged
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
And they souls was never in it
And I'm so misrepresented by niggas that claim trill
They souls was never in it

// Banana //

[Verse 1]
Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift for the tongue
This shit might open the door
Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some
22 put piff in a bowl
And I was bent into corners, hot boxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to ghosts
And I be sippin' the bit probably sippin a bitch
I ain't really into tippin the hoes
See my brother got weight, my sister at home
When I get straight my sister gettin flown
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin grown
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on
Can I get a glass cup and a lil' Henny
I'm, too cold but a little timid
I blow checks save a lil' penny
I'm too young for some big money
Ooh come girl get some dick from me
My job needs some piss from me
Uhn, lil bro can you fuck with me
Came through at the last minute
Lil' wasting my time, lacing with perks
Perks in a bind
Hazy oh baby I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can find

[Hook]
We are the young and Xanax
There's nowhere to go
To hide from your lows
We are the young and Xanax
There's nowhere to go
Stuck on the high

[Verse 2]
My son sleep, I'm rollin it up I don't sleep
I'm runnin' for bucks, don't tweet
You fuckin' with us I won't eat
Start stomping your feet, I need that
Depending on all of you feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and a stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best burn
She screaming out give me the rest hun
Pearl neckless I empty my left nut
Most niggas can't fuck with my worse shit
I'm scribing my living with curses
Just wait till I get this shit perfect
You niggas can't fuck with my verses
See they really don't think that I'm bout this
Don't make me come run in your houses
We know where your mamma your dad lives
Ooh baby [?]
My niggas got triggas and fast lit
Don't like how we living it lasts
You out of your trigger and backseat
Just looking at the shooter it's Mike D
Your rosary shining so nicely
We innocent kids if you ask me
I rode in the Benz in the backseat
Them vices they swarm and attack me
Got diamonds and niners upon me
That Juvie that Percy that Bun B
Sell track in this black while we dumping

[Hook]

// Brad Jordan //

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Now it's just me, my nigga Mikey D, getting throwed
We was bangin' out some Masta P, on the road
I prefer my word with platinum teeth, maybe gold
They don't like it when you come direct, well fuck, but Spottie bold
Tell them hoes they better come correct, cause I fuck
My momma told me we no 'ceptin' any memberships, no adding losses
I won't step up in your dealership until I'm flossin'
We no flexy with the funk, add a blessing to that punk
Damn, I got a son he on the way, but that's my baby
I've been spittin' like it's crack or some, like since the 80's
I was born I think in '91, that mean I'm chosen
When I slide back through your hood, bitch, just have a frozen, bitch

[Hook]
Yeah, Goddamn, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Goddamn, I'm in, feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Scarface somethin', like I'm Brad Jordan
Feel like I'm the fuckin', feel like I'm Brad Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental
In Houston, OPM on them pussy ass niggas
Feel like I'm Brad Jordan

[Bridge: Isaiah Rashad]
Now you would think I work from South Park, grindin', always makin' trouble
Grippin', on another level, mothafucka
I feel like droppin' classics, like the rucker
And rappers be too passive

[Verse 2: Michael Da Vinci]
It's just me, my brother Spottie, bitch, sit low
I've been drinkin' since my momma called, around 4
Niggas asking me too many questions, fuckin' throwed
Ride Da Vinci, Mike, December we was losing, now we winnin'
Can I sport a couple in this, play for bucks that Brandon Jennings
Wear your crown and your pocket, or that shit'll come up missin'
You that nigga but the misses, eat a dick and mind ya business
This for all my Eastside niggas who be eating, do no sleeping
For their seedlin', never go to parties even if it is the weekend
Shout-out to the women who be faithful to their pimpin'
And shout-out to them haters who be all up in their feelins
And shout-out to my daddy, I'mma buy your ass a Bentley

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad]
A bunch of bustas
I'm on everybody's asses, and this the notice
And I ain't even tryin', ho, did you notice?
And this the standard, fuckin' bogus
You fuckin' rappers

// Shot You Down //

[Verse]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, it's reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, role model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't let the shine beam me up, then I'm riding Spock
No crying 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil', staying well fed
Bitch don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Momma taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried 'bout this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't tryna be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and I'll kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick!

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Outro]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, don't make a sound
I came, I saw, I conquered, what you do now?
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do?
Don't make a sound, bitch
