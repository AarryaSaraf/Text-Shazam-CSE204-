Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though
Made a nigga perfect for his next hoe
Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though
Made a nigga perfect for his next hoe
Knew you would tryna bait me like a set
If I give ten percent, I'ma need it back tenfold


Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya
Lay in the field, burn it down, we all herb

And if you dead, tell me somethin'
Like, what's ya life and how you livin'?
Did you slide it, did you build it?
Did you find it, did you grab it, did you ride it?
Like on the TV, tell me off on the marathon
Oh, you greedy, catch you, now don't embarrass some
You can't see me, John Cena in camouflage
And they see me, cashin' out on a Megatron
And the VV, lookin' just like it
Is Steve in the back? Is you broke? It's all perfect
Sleep on the cash, it was life, it's all real
Laid on the floor, I was broke, it's all worth it
Land on your tail, break it down, it's all word
Laid on the floor, is you drunk? We all stupid
Fuck you to sleep, it was love, it's all good
How many days have I died? We all losers
Laid in the streets, said "Five", it's call cap

Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya
Lay in the field, burn it down, we all herb


I can call this face out
The breakup with a breakdown
Been tryna find a way out
I'm waitin' for the catch
Maybe call you up soon
But Jake, got me like "Just cool"
What I want and must do
They don't always match
Runnin' for the hills when it gets rough
Show me, sure is feelin' like a setup
I'ma be a isolated mess
Just to look as good as it gets
Nothin' less when I mess up


Yeah, who on the edge, it's the funds, it's all Ubers
Starvin' a child, it's a check, it's all hers
We could've died, there was shots, they don't know it
Sparin' a child goin' wild
Yeah, AMG in the dark, it's all motor
Crashin' the Jeep, it's fine, it's all hers
Fuck it, it's robbers, who shot us all posted
Spillin' the drink, goin' wild

Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya
Lay in the field, burn it down, we all herb


Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though

Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though
Made a nigga perfect for his next hoe
Knew you would tryna bait me like a set
If I give ten percent, I'ma need it back
