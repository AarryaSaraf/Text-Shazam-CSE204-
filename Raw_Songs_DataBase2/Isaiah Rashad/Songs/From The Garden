Came out bussin'
Came out puffin'
Came out fuckin', on yo cousin
I do all these floozies worser
Than they daddy but you love her
You in trouble
I'm lil sunny
I go BBQ with something
That's you busy
It ain't shit
I went shopping, left it running

Check my hunnids, check my onion
We watch cable, at my aunty's
'Cause my papa wasn't trappin'
But my uncle up to something
Mr. Magic, Billy Batson
Mr. Magic, Billy Batson
Miss me with that local hatin' on a nigga, get it crackin'

I'm not surprised, I'm on the rise
Been a lil ride, wet as my eyes
Spam it a lot, just hold it down
All I require, just hold it down
They gon' shit talk when we ain't around
Niggas be hating with feet on the ground
Got the lil jet with the beat on the couch
Nut on the Gucci and beat on her mouth

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin' (Hold on wait, hold on wait)
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin' (Hold on wait, hold on wait)
Came out bussin' (Wait)

Chanel on my feet, yeah, that's fur on my C's
I be fuckin' with the Bees, like Muhammad Ali
Dip her, upper cut this thing
Got yo bitch on the edge of her seat
She on the ecstasy, I'm on the bean
Swing her the ecstasy, edge of my v
(And usually), I like repetitive beat
I like the way that she moving my meat
Quality bitches, they look good to me
But I fuck the same girl 'cause I don't even cheat
That is a lie
Repetitive freak
I ain't even look, no, I ain't even seek
I ain't even peek
G5, G5
Competitive jeep
I'm tryna get all the muh fuggin' cheese
Bitch, I'ma boss, I'm wherever it be
I been on tour, I see more
I tell the motherfuckers feed me beats
Just like my music, yo bitch she elite

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin'

I'm gon' run it, I'm so cunning
High tech digit, flat for button
Passport shawty, airport prolly
Nascar audi, Swanton bomb it
Two white bitches, still gon' kick it
Fly shit, kicking
Steel toe pidgeon
Young like slizzy
Get back witcha
Step back, hit 'em with the step back swish it
Hatin' nigga hoping that it melt my glisten
Shit might triple, shit my missile
Shit might hit you, Fridigy Parker
And my Cody, that my nigga
I been stacking for a really
When he pull up, they gon' end it
He went platinum, up in prison
I'm just floating on a river

Please be early, please be gorgeous
Please be widdit, please be for it
Let me do donuts in your foreign
Let me play number 8 while I do it
Let me control it, I can control it
Eat it with one hand, maybe with nothin'
Play with my zipper, play with my bubba
That was yo sister, that was my summer

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out...
