I'll leave right now Kal
I'll fucking leave bro, ah-ha-ha-ha

I'm parking (Yeah)
Don't turn it off, just keep it rolling (Yeah)
Uh, just keep it rolling, look keep the lights on, just watch this (Yeah)
Watch, watch this, look, look

Yeah
Me and my niggas on p's
Then we was on blades
Then we was on sofas (Ayy)
Knowing them bitches gone tease
Like we was stage
When we was on porches (Ayy, ayy)
Sunny done got a lil' paid
And got a lil' horse
And got a lil' fortress, yeah
I was just having them days
I'd hit the subway
Then I would hit Portia, yeah

Bitch you a fever
Bitch don't sweat me when I'm hot
You want some leisure (Yeah, oh, oh, nah, nah, not at all)
I got the big truck
Parking trying to save the world
I drove the eco, yeah

Me and my niggas on p's
Then we was on blades
Then we was on sofas (Ayy)
Knowing them bitches gone tease (Ayy)
Like we was stage
When we was on porches, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Sunny done got a lil' paid
And got a lil' horse
And got a lil' fortress, yeah
I was just having them days
I'd hit the subway
Then I would hit Portia, yeah

Hey mista (Yeah)
Can I light my bitches up?
Can I cool my bitches off?
Can I bring them bitches home?
Then I put my bitches on
Stocks and some good investments
Plots in a new direction
Pop that lil' coochie, baby
I got the Uber waiting
Shotgun for you and Stacy
Top of the generation
Too cool for complications
Don't leave my Johnson waiting
Pimp or you prostituting
Bite that piranha, baby
Sing it's your concert, baby
Ooh, you a monster, baby
Spit on the rocket
Float on the mothership
Don't call me daddy, baby
Don't need no love
But I can't bust
When I'm masturbating
Pop off the ratchet
And it's lust
For the record (Man)

Me and my niggas on p's (Bitch)
Then we was on blades
Then we was on sofas (Bitch)
Knowing them bitches gone tease (Bitch)
Like we was stage
When we was on porches, yeah
Sunny done got a lil' paid
And got a lil' horse
And got a lil' fortress, yeah
I was just having them days
I'd hit the subway
Then I would hit Portia

Yeah-erm
Uh, you can delete this little "yeah, yeah, yeah" thing I did
