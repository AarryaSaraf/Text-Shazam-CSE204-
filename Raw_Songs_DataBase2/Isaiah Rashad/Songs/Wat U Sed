Whaddup bae
And my bitch eat me up while I'm driving
And I swear it's a show, not a riot
Uh

I was trippin', you was trippin', who the pilot?
Bet my bitch eat me up while I'm drivin'
And I swear it's a show, not a riot
And I had a nightmare last night that I wasn't countin' up
We had too many hoes in this bitch, I had to round 'em up
And I had too many hoes in my face, I had to cut 'em off
I been focused on my one-of-one
And I hope your pussy good as my bank account (What you said?)
Ayy, bitch, can I break you off? Trunk wavin' at the mall
Hoes on your side of town hate when they ain't involved
Geeked on my brudda pack, beat and I'm overcharged (Yeah)
Hurt, what I'm servin' in it, spread like the word of God
Fuck what a nigga do, reach for some inner peace
Geeked on my side of town, dope when I'm slidin' down
Ghost when I'm slidin' down, Ghost when I'm slidin' down
Porsche when I'm slidin' down (What you said?)


All the hoes with the shorts in ya ass
And you got the D'USSE fallin' out your glass
Ole man don't want ya in the club
'Cause your pussy poppin' start fights in the club
Come through in your new rental car
Bitches all in your face 'cause you a star
And ya come with 'bout four, five hoes
Down to fight anything straight out the door


Roll but I make him eat up, yeah, yeah, yeah (On go)
Drunk but I make him drink up, yeah, yeah, yeah (Gone)
Real, I don't wanna sneak up, yeah, yeah (Gone)
Pop pills but I make him geek up, yeah, yeah, yeah (Grrat)
Drunk on a Saturday, hoes are mad, hoes are mad (Hoes are mad)
Dirt, it go thataway, hope it's bad, hope it's bad (Hope it's bad)
Real when you grind (Yeah), real when you shine (Yeah)
Drunk, drunk, drunk on a Saturday (On the way)
Lookin' back when it spazz with your curls and your ass out
Bad like a girl from the ave, goin' anti
Keep it bad, pop a tag, go and let it air out
Drop it fast, let it spazz, go and let your hair down
Shush when I say I get it done, when they sneak, I see up
Flip a pack and make a bun, when it done, I link up
Get ahead like you a geek, show no face if you discreet
Come and put this drink on me if you wanna link up
