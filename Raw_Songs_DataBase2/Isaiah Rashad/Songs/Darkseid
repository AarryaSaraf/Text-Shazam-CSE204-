Yeah, yeah, yeah

What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch

Yeah, whatever gon' keep your nose dry, my nigga, I'm with it
I know it got ya froze, my nigga, I feel it
Some niggas be runnin' away from life
Some niggas cut off the legs
If I was you, I'd be dead
Whatever gon' keep your mind blown, my nigga, maintain the wheel
My partner know I just came back, see, I done been dead for real
They mixin' up all of that no name, you know we be scared to chill
You know we be scared to feel, or anything else but, yeah

Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds

Is that you on the edge?
Whatever was under the bunk bed, I ain't scared, I'm ready
They locked the horns with matadors, okay, don't get too heavy
He shined his fangs and cuban chain, okay, don't get too heavy
They dug a grave, he came alive, okay, don't get too heavy

What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch
What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch

Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds
Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds
