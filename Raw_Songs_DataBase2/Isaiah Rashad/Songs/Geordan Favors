Okay, okay, If you don't fuck with me then get the fuck
And stay the fuck from 'round
The world done fucked me up
Tell me what's the play cause you know I'm down
Ratchet on my side, hope I'm making Juicy J proud
And I know my way 'round
That trigger slide on niggas like playgrounds
Okay now, God a funny nigga
How I'm conscious that I lost my conscious
Got the 30 on me, he got the 32
All my niggas look like Magic Johnson
Brought my little partner had the magnum on him
Way before he ever had to buy a condom
If he buy a condom, it's to fuck the world
She done screwed a lot of niggas at the bottom
We was kids hittin' backflips, on them pissy ass mattresses
Practicin' then flower, before I 
Knocking wheels off axis'
Act as if we fine, pour a cup of that Activis
I coulda been me an activist
We see them acts of crime
Ended up as a catalyst
For all the motherfuckin' madness'
Shattering my mind
Dark times my nigga
We was s'possed to be the light bearers
When my partner died, I ain't even had time to cry
It was in morning havin' night terrors
And I never addressed it, I don't write letters
Once you get the grieving you're a goner
I ain't pussy, push me if you wanna
See my lil' woadie keep it on 'em
(Lil' bitch my woadie)


I got some favors on me
Don't cross the line, talkin' bout
I got some favors on me
Don't cross the line
