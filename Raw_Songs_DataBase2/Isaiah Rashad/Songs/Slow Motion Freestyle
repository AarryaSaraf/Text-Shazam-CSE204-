I got these hoes way down in Dallas, that's a national treasure
They act like sisters but they act and they get nasty together
They like to cheer for eachother when I'm fucking 'em both
I can't decide which bitch I like fucking the most
I got a hoe from Chattanooga, know me back from the stems
From the root, she hit my line, say want me back in the scan
I take it back to me and Quesha when I'm back at the crib
We don't never take it easy when I'm back at the crib
I got some floozies in Miami that I'll never betray
They done got me out of jams that I'll never forget
I got a surgeon, a doctor, a dentist
A bitch that like forehead kisses, not hickeys

I ask her, "What's good besides me and this dick?"
She working that mouth, I'm working this whip
Still working late nights, real money, might spend
Yeah money, might spend, still running like, uh
Six hunnid HP, lil sunny HD
Late time in KD, we were running like, yeah
Slow motion for me
Slow motion for me
Slow motion for me
Ask her, "What's good besides me and this dick?"
She working that mouth, I'm working this whip
Slow motion for me
Slow motion for me
Slow motion, haha, yeah

Now bounce for the Juvenile, bounce for the Juvenile
Bounce trick, bounce, bounce, bounce
I said bounce for the Juvenile, bounce for the Juvenile
Bounce trick, bounce, bounce, bounce
