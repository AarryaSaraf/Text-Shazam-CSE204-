I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit (yeah, yeah)
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement

Yeah, yay, Soul
Took my time with this shit
Turned my time into dinners
Turned my soul into gold
Turned my winters to winning
But see this winning ain't easy
Winning turned me to sinning
Turned that bottle to venting
Now my venting been spilling
All these lyrics so soulful
Turn these hoes into women
But sometimes women no fun
So tell those bitches what's up
And bitches turn me polygamous
Now my girl she ain't into it
Say this industry changed me
Could be right
See she knew me from straight out the basement
Now I done shapeshift
Used to be gracious
Look at the spaceship

Yeah, okay, okay, okay
The v hit was close up
Costa La No Stress
Four eyes, I'm juggling no job
I'm saving up protons
There's platinum in both sides
It happens in no time
My nigga was co-pi...
It's lo-fi, at your spot the do' knock

Okay okay, but please don't walk into my crib
Without some screw and some blunts
All my hoes into jazz see
Some of my women hood, but pretend to be classy
I'm allergic to bullshit
You can't sneak nothing passed me
I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement

Now everything I do is made you's break
Mastered my pump fake
Can't tell weather my nose went numb or the funk fake
Vomit out my conscious on ya any given Sunday
If you in the huddle, you know we already won, uhh
Ten toes permanent to the cement
My peace forever, me and my demons made an agreement
And talk ours ways on clearance, but silence is still the cheapest
My promises resemble a rental, I rarely keep it, uhh
Sleeper cell, sleeper agent, people's favorite crazy child
From where violence tend to come with shots, uh, flagrant foul
They want pure, are coming from the same heart they defile
I'm about to- I'm about to break it down
Wait, somebody knocking

Okay okay, but please don't walk into my crib
Without some screw and some blunts
All my hoes into jazz see
Some of my women hood, but pretend to be classy
I'm allergic to bullshit
You can't sneak nothing passed me
I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement
