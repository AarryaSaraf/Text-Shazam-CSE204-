 panel curtains disrupting
The paste, the peace, and the past
Even before they were constructing
Harry said it was built to last
Mother country, daddy's commission
Cause there's a stronger storm every fall
Nowhere left to climb when the ocean rises
Higher than the kevlar walls

Oh, fear's taken over
Fears take him over
Fear's taken over
Fear's taken over

 faces  from Fulton
In defiance never bows
No one asked permission from no one
Well, no one asked the folks who know 'bout
Bright lighters huddle, conspiring
Rusting in the rockaway snow
Japanese fleet bust beneath our feet
The screech of midnight thunder below
Be it, bends like a wire
Soon to the spire
Steel psycho structures
And dreams falling over

Fear take it over
Fears take him over
Fear had taken over
