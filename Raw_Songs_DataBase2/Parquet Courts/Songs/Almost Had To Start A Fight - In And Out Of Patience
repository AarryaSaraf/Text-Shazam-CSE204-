Almost, almost, almost, almost, almost had to start a fight
Don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know how to react so I won't
What do, what do, what do, what do you do when you are provoked?
When does, when does, when does, when does, when does something start being a joke?
Caught up, caught up, caught up, caught up in our morbid modern lives
Adapt, adapt, adapt, adapt to the void then if you must
And to, and to, and to, and to just prefer the status quo
What if, what if, what if, what if I've got tired of being polite?

Why am I searching for reason?
I'm in the chaos dimension
Reasons eclipsed by tension

I want, I want, I want, I want not to feel numb about death
Finding, finding, finding, finding peace is not an easy task
Breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing to see if there's any left
Reading, reading, reading, reading about how many people died and

Can someone tell me the reason?
I'm in the chaos dimension
Trapped in a brutal invention



If it stops I'm, if it stops I'm, if it stops I'm having a bad dream

In and out of patience
I just can't keep it around
Most of mine's been taken
Is there a finite amount?
Had a little love
(But I gave it to you)
Now someone's at my door
(And he needs some too)
Lighting up my phone
(Darkening my mood)
And all I got left is
This shit attitude
At least music is playing in my head

If it stops I'm, if it stops I'm, if it stops I'm having an unshakable nightmare

In and out of patience
Don't have enough to share
Sometimes on life itself
I'm neither here nor there
The MTA
(Took the first of it)
Twenty-minute delay
(Wasn't the worst of it)
Saw it underground
(You could burn to death)
Now you're right on time to take what I got left
Funky music playing in my head

If it stops I'm, if it stops I'm, and if it stops I'm counting on you
