Before the grief, I found peace in my selfish ways
My yesterdays were erased
Death will bring change

Before the crash, I revealed in potential untapped
Mortality was not contained
Death will bring change

The bottom of this well is rich with bitter water, it lays still, drowsy, dreaming, and dying to get out

Now I'm anchored but my lines are all tangled
Can't afford to unwind

Before this wreck, I found peace in my health
Now my insides rebel
Death will bring change
