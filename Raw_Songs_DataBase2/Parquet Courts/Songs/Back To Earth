I was biding my time, desperately, I walked the line
Between health and poverty
Looked into a face, all my thoughts they were replaced
I had the nerve to call it soul

Get love where you find it
It's the only fist we have to fight with
And soon, you're headed back to earth

Found myself along a path, trailed all my steps back
Found a place to relearn to relax
Rested like an empty cage and where the moon
Starts everyday
And I can dress up like a saint

Twice I've been around the world and I'm sure
There ain't no one living no more no choice
But to buy all your own time
Spend all your money at the casket store
