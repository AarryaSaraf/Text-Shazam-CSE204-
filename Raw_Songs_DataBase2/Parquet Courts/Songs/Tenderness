We've come to replace your clock's old stubborn hands
We are the answer to why they never had a chance
It was not so long ago that the world was mostly slow
The age of iron, steam and speed
Turned a stroll to a stampede
But we've come to increase time in between ticks
And there is romance in the slow dances because
They're fertile in hush, futile in haste
These are your nerves, this is how they taste

Well I can't count how many times I've been outdone by nihilism
Joined the march that splits an open heart into a schism
I cower at the thought of other people's expectations
And yet still hand over mine to them

Travel where you are, tourism is sin
These are the ruins we left behind, you can't take pictures of them
If what they say is true, then you become what you chew
If it decays spit it out, affectation is a drought
That you wait through when you hate everything that you do
You wanna live outside the groove, then fine
But it's there like a flower blooming in your ear
Open up your mouths, pollinate your peers

Nothing reminds the mind of power like the cheap odor of plastic leaking fumes
We crave, consume, the rush it feels fantastic
But like power turns to mold, like a junkie going cold
I need the fix of a little tenderness
