Express yourself without the tools that they give you
Want something they didn't tell you to want
Say something without the words that they fed you
Find something they didn't tell you to hunt for

Because
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 


Be yourself and not the figure they mould
Look for something they've been trying to hide
Do something you were never told to
Don't keep it to yourself, don't keep it inside

Yeah
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 

The more you flex it, the more it grows
The more you feed it, the less it owes
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Yeah
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 
The more you use it, the more it works 

The more you flex it, the more it grows
The more you feed it, the less it owes
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Yeah
The more it works 
The more it works 
The more it works 
The more it works 
The more it works 
The more it works 


Yeah listen up, listen up everybody
What could I even mean?
Could it be your teeth, could it be your eyes
Could it be your mouth, could it be your spleen

It's kind of like all those things
It's kind of wrapped into one
The more you use it, the more it works
The more you use it, the more it works

Define yourself, not in title
Embrace a concept not taught in school
The more you use it, the more it works
If you waste it, you're a fool

Yeah
The more it works
