Watching strangers smile
Never knew it was a privilege
Until the white fearful eyes was all I saw
Filling out forms as the whole music loops
Now I've been trapped inside for weeks on end
My knees, my back, my brain all start to bend

City music makes me want to lose my mind
Like when it taunts me through the bite of summer evenings
Walk out the door to the store, buy a beer
And I'm so paranoid my mask will slip
I just can't seem to get a goddamn grip, a grip, a grip

Do you think about book and letter?
Make the effort that you won't
Do you have 20/20 vision?
I don't
