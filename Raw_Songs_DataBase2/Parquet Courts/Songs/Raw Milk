Awake in an unmade nest, peepers hacking into day
I've heard that sound so many times
It terrifies and comforts me
Scratching at the door
It's time
First she summons, next she feeds
And I'm going back home to my old used-to-be

Chula dances for me like a dervish whirling
In my eyes
Spin around me rabid child
I won't see you for some time...

She gets feisty when she's been drinking
Never can tell what the hell she's thinking
Smiles like she's got one eye winking at you
Dog walkers in the living room and the
Strange one is in the kitchen and she's
Brewing something bitchin
Just for you
