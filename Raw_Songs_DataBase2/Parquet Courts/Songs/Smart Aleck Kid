Over the prison to the sea
Like none of those pursue a craft
Apathy and anger are the same
Nasal burning time to try it
I need something to clear the air
And all I've ever thought to do is sing
My guy cheated on something or another
Everything is calling and a shame
Elbows drawn by risen pain
Heater with my added space
Anyone that laughed at will get brained

All it's gonna take is a word to a gal
All it's gonna take is a word to a gal
For the smart aleck kid
For the smart aleck kid

Getting on like  rabbits
 by the quarter gallon
If it's down to something I feel lame
Have a bagel, drink a tea
A banana would be good for me
Like all that  that you think it was a
P.A.R.T. Why? Cos I gotta
Feel like I'm doing something right
Start a fight is not ideal
But ruining something with a handle of
Bourbon or a shoe, that would be nice!

All it's gonna take is a word to the gal
All it's gonna take is a word to the gal
For the smart aleck kid
For the smart aleck kid
