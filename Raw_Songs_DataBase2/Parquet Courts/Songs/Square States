"How are you, how have you been?"
Sandy
We redeem ourselves in checkpoints, not in true moments of life
Now I wander through the awkward pauses that became our new benchmarks of time
Oh, there's no name for this feeling that your absence has defined

Upon your bedside table lies the graveyard of romance
An empty wrapper weighted by a jar of rocks from France
A necklace used to magnify your eyes, and I made the first advance
Oh, I did it just to break the ice, they needn't be enhanced

"How are you, how have you been?"
I practiced on the drive across the square states in between us to see you alive
I imagine that the first glance there would say if there was something to revive
Oh, I got a room in Bozeman, I had three days to arrive

One more time!
