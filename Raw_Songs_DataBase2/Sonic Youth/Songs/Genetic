Let me tell you every thought that I've come to
When I think of all the things that you do
I can't see if you're the only one - it's hard to say
And I think it's all the same to me today

I can see you too
If I can just see you this one time
I sit alone
Everyone's at home
I see it
I believe
Somehow I know it's true
Your genetic kiss to me
I live inside of you

I have heard it said before it'll never happen
Had it drilled in since a kid it makes my head spin
I'm still looking for these thing that I can't find
Thoughts just come and go, swirl into my mind

I see me and you
Then it's him I'm thinking of
We sit alone
No one else at home
I taste it
I feel
And now I know it's true
Your genetic kiss reveals
I'll always be with you

Hey baby, it's you I'm thinking of
Hey baby, who do you love
Don't worry baby, I'm watching them as you sleep
Let me whisper, some things for you to keep

There's no perfect idea
There's no perfect fate
Just little stabs of happiness
Sometimes a little too late
So keep your eyes wide open
And know what you're made of
Remember first thought best thought
Try to stay in love...
