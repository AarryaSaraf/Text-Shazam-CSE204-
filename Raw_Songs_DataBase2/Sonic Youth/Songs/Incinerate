I ripped yr heart out from yr chest

Replaced it with a grenade blast


Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 



Firefighters hose me down

I don't care I'll burn out anyhow

It's 4 alarm girl nothing to see

Hear the sirens come for me

You dosed my soul with gasoline

You flicked a match into my brain


Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 



The firefighters are so nice

I remember you so cold as ice

Now flames are licking at yr feet

Sirens come to put me out of misery

You wave yr torch into my eyes

Flamethrower lover burning mind


Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate 
Incinerate
