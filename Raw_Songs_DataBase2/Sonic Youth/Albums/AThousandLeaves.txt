Album: AThousandLeaves

// Contre Le Sexisme //

Describe the touch, no it's the thought 

It's warm and yellow and has a ruffle 

It's warm and yellow and... 

He's so quiet I forgot he's there 

And I think here I am. 

"oh alice, come back he's just a kitten... 

He's just a kitten" 

A thousand leaves for your disguise fall on 

The sky and looking up from down is a sea to 

Realize the leaves are falling up and down 

Up and round. 

And this is from my heart to you 

A crazy wind will stir me too and contre de la 

Sexisme 

I am with you.

// Sunday //

Sunday comes alone again 

A perfect day for a quiet friend 

And you - you will set it free 

I see new morning yound yr face 

Everybody sez its another phase 

And now - now its come to me 

See the magic in yr eyes 

I see it come as no surprise 

And you - you turn yr eyes away 

Yeah you - you turn it all away 

I guess its true its never too late 

Still I don't know what to do today 

Oh why - can't I set you free 

Will you - do the same for me 

Sunday comes and sunday goes 

Sunday always seems to move so slow 

To me - here she comes again 

A perfect ending to a perfect day 

A perfect ending what can I say 

To you - lonely sunday friend 

With you - sunday never ends

// Female Mechanic Now On Duty //

I wanna shut you down 

Love yr. sight and sound 

I wanna spin you round, till yr. underground 

I wanna strip you down 

Till you feel the round 

I wanna feel your shine 

I wanna waste some time 

I wanna paint my face 

Like a model out of place 

Cause im supposed to dare 

The machine will tear 

I'll throw up sometime 

And then you'll be mine 

I wanna serve you down 

While my mind is on the ground 

I wanna move your switch 

Make you go quish 

My desiring machine 

Yeah it's made pretty clean 

Now I'll turn the dial 

And I'll put you ina pile 

Modern women cry 

Modern women don't cry 

Cry don't cry 

You hut me with your lie 

Touch the fire in the rain and 

See the children 

Stop their play and 

Look for shelter 

In the garden of their 

Make believe and I 

I believe 

Perfection is a 

I can see what you're going thru but 

I can't melt my head to what you're 

Whisked away to light the bomb a 

Thousand leaves are left to stay and...

Sing yr children 

Yr children song 

Sing yr love child

And down/they go 

To sleep/so slow

Sing yr love child 

Love is on 

Sing yr child lights 

Sing yr child lights 

Lights are gold 

Sing yr child life

// Hoarfrost //

I put my feet deep in the tracks that you made 

Walked behind you off into the wood 

'We'll know where when we get there' you said 

And we both knew we would 

High above like a spider 

The colors turning brown 

Freeways passing by us 

I took yr hand and we knelt down 

Wheels paddle wheels paddle movement as we go 

Trees passing trees passing signs along the road 

A view thru the trees to a couple in the snow 

A view thru the trees to a couple standing in 

The snow 

Suddenly the trees were flashing by us 

Clouds reflecting fast across your eyes 

We turned into a frozen medow 

The wind the only sound 

'We'll know where when we get there' you said 

'We'll know where when we get there' you said

// French Tickler //

Free time, free time 

I have got it gonna get me some 

Free time, free time 

I would spend it forever captivated 

Free time, free time 

Would you tell me the secret of yr arm 

Free time, free time 

Forever fabulastic, blowup, pleasuristic 

I feel combustible 

That's my will say it all 

Mille feuille 

Mille feuille 

Mille feuille 

Now you better take a deep breath 

The smell is just the best 

I'll transform even yr breast 

You are my new weekend guest 

I can't believe this could happen to me 

Caught inside someone's knee 

Free time, free time 

Uncovered forever barest endeavor 

Free time, free time 

If you want me splash me forever 

Free time, free time 

Let it happen the leisure, enchanting 

Free time, free time 

Yr neck is my favorite pleeze don't spare it 

I feel combustible that's my will, say it all 

Now you better cough up the dough 

If you want to join the show 

Exotique is not for free 

Spend wisely eternity 

Engine of desire is on the road 

Don't get stuck without a job 

Free time, free time 

You have got it gonna get me some 

Free time, free time 

Wandering, fantastic, sparkling demanded 

Free time, free time 

Did I mention that you control me 

Free time, free time 

The merest endeavor slightly forever

// Hits Of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg) //

Today I 

Said goodbye 

To my conflicted goddess 

Her lush eyes 

Show surprise 

At how we could gather knowledge 

The painting has a dream 

Where shadow breaks the scene 

And the colors run off 

Blue is bashful 

Green is my goal 

Yellow girls are running backwards 

Until the nextime 

With six hits of sunshine 

The lights will blind up with blues in haiku 

The shadow has a dream 

Where painters look to sea 

The colors burn out 

Now I know where 

I once saw you 

Stepping into muddy water 

John's reflection 

Decried perfection 

Now you walk him through the gardren 

Waiting in the wings 

Painters shade their dreams 

With falling colors 

See me wave good 

Bye forever 

Happiness the goddess lover 

Hurry back re 

Member last time 

The hits of sunshine 

The hits of goldmine 

I'll see you back tonite 

Where painters love the light 

And yellow shadow girls 

Today I 

Say goodbye 

To my complicious goddess 

Her hushed eyes 

Show surprise 

And how we captured knowledge 

I'll see you back tonite 

Where shadows dream of light 

Let's slip on outside

// Karen Koltrane //

Karen's moving out 

Out into the sky 

Karen trips on a cloud 

Sets down w stars in her eyes 

She's alone in a room 

She's deep inside of her mind 

Karen's leaving for the snow 

Somewhere to somewhere... blind 

She cut the silver lining in my soul 

I was tethered to her for a time 

Are we still together? 

Will she stay forever? 

(will she stay?... beside... 

Flashlight... Karen stay... [etc.]) 

A LOVE SUPREME 

Karen, yr hanging on the line 

Wraps yr coat tight around 

Karen, yr eyes are on the prize 

I'll catch you on my way down

// The Ineffable Me //

Cant catch me 

I'm syntax free 

I'm preconceived 

Preternaturally 

I don't invest 

In what is best 

Your once and for all 

Means shit to me 

Hate translator 

Hate translator 

Hate translator 

You can't catch me 

Don't mistake her 

Don't misshape her 

You don't mutate her 

You can't get me 

The radical beacon 

The preverbal season 

The abstract poetics 

Immediate treason 

Do you remember 

Reductionist lie 

Fundamentalist 

Alibi 

Hate castrater 

Hate castrater 

Hate castrater 

Don't fuck with me 

Don't you break her 

And don't deflate her 

Don't outdate her 

Or you'll fuck with me 

Its a cushy job 

A pussy's job 

A cum junkie's job 

Makes my dick throb 

Feel...ineffable 

Cant catch me 

I'm syntax free 

I'm preconceived 

Prehistoricly 

Don't be alarmed 

Don't be alarmed 

Don't be alarmed 

Its only me 

Come back in my arms 

Back in my arms 

Back in my arms 

The ineffable me

// Snare, Girl //

Im here for you 

Cant you see what im doin 

I bring you news from the kingdom 

Of disciples in ruin 

Behold a child 

Has just been born 

Into a life 

Of secrets sworn 

Hold out yr hands 

And take these palms ive been given 

They are wild with beauty faded 

And they can guide this child to heaven 

So rest assured 

And understand 

How harvest eyes 

Renew your land 

Im here looking for you dear 

If I could see clear 

Thry all the sun stained stations 

Its all up in the air girl 

Its like a snare girl 

In all its manifestations 

Im here for you 

Cant you see what im saying 

I have palms from the ruins 

Where disciples are straying 

Im coming after you 

With mercy given 

And your secrets out 

Now youre forgiven 

Im here looking for you dear 

Cant you see clear 

All these sun stained stations 

Its you under the stairs girl 

With a snare girl 

Sounding salutations

// Heather Angel //

Never gonna ya do it 

A world below 

Heather angel you are somewhere 

On the show 

Don't you think you would find 

Where to go 

I want to go dancing on the other side 

I want to buy a phonograph 

But the money's gone 

He bought books and records 

I don't care about that 

I just want to be alive 

And go to the other... 

I don't want money or books 

Have to decide 

Passive 

And you were shot in the name of it 

And then you'd see yeh, yeh 

Then you'd see 

The relationship 

And walking I see you in the clouds 

And I fall for 

I would fall for you 

I would... 

Forever 

Goodbye, bye 

Goodbye 

And that is all 

STOP STOP
