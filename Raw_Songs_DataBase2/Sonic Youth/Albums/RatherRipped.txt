// Reena //

You keep me comin' home again

You keep me comin' home again

When you were gone,

I met a friend


She taught me how to

Live in the end

Are her eyes

Brown or blue?


How does she keep her

Static cool

My heart and soul

Are rocked up in her eyes

A little blink I recognize

A little blink, yea, that's my prize


A white horse

Sittin right there by her side

Hard to ignore

Hard to disguise

She'll never ever

Realize...


You keep me comin' home again

You keep me comin' home again

When you were gone

I was out of my mind


I had a friend who laughed all the time

I had a friend who cried all the time

I had a friend who screamed all the time

I had a friend who lied all the time

// Incinerate //

I ripped yr heart out from yr chest

Replaced it with a grenade blast


Incinerate [4x]


Firefighters hose me down

I don't care I'll burn out anyhow

It's 4 alarm girl nothing to see

Hear the sirens come for me

You dosed my soul with gasoline

You flicked a match into my brain


Incinerate [4x]


The firefighters are so nice

I remember you so cold as ice

Now flames are licking at yr feet

Sirens come to put me out of misery

You wave yr torch into my eyes

Flamethrower lover burning mind


Incinerate [8x]

// Do You Believe In Rapture? //

Stand behind his drunken amp

Stand behind his light of love

Hear him yowl his bloody tounge

Hear him yell 4 blood and war

[Chorus:]

Do you believe in his sweet sensation

Do you believe in second chance

Do you believe in rapture babe


A terrible hit strikes today

A terrible hit for the parade

Burnin' eyes seek jesus comin

Jesus comes to pave the way

[Chorus]


Can you tell me what to feel

Open up yr tender soul

Can I drink yr drunken mercy

Wine burns the devils hole

[Chorus]

// Sleepin Around //

Sleepin' around sleepin' around

What will the neighbors say

Sleepin' around all over town

What will the neighbors say

[Chorus:]

What you did was wrong

What did you good is gone

Nothing you do is right

Always ends up in a fight


Sleepin' around sleepin' around

What will the neighbors do

Sleepin' around all over town

What will the neighbors do

[Chorus]


Sleepin' around sleepin' around

What will the neighbors think

Sleepin' around all over town

What will the neighbors think

[Chorus]

// What A Waste //

Hey gimme hollow stimulation

It's so sleazy to be free

Lets invest in dull creation

Thrill city cheap legacy


What a waste

Yr so chaste

I can't wait

To taste yr face


Vapid signals lead me to you

A sublime spectacular dud

Safe and sound from chatter confusion

Get the picture yes it's clear as mud

// Jams Run Free //

Blast id earth

Om immersed

Gold in cave

The blondes come first


I love the way you move

I hope its not too late

For me


Its too good

On this sea

Where the light

Is green

Where the light

Is green


Jagged brain

Slow refrain

We love the jams

And black runs free


I love the way you move

I hope its not too late

For me


Its too good

On this sea

Where the light

Is green

Where the light

Is green

// Rats //

When the rats run riot

And the screen door slams

When the trees grow quiet

Nothing but cats and cans

When the breeze says try it

But you can hardly see

When your love has died

And you rat on me


I see your eyes in the half-light

I see the number on your wall

Endless strange things I see at night

You don't see anything at all


Shine a light into your soul

City streets so freezing cold

City shadows wander out

When they let the rats out

Rats

You call it love alright

That was the catch

A cold suicide

Let me place you in my past

With other precious toys

But if you're ever feeling low down in the fractured sunshine

I'll help you feel the noise


Shine down

You can go on home

Shine down

Go

Go


Rats

You're working overtime

You are the moon beyond your mind

When the rats run riot

And the screen door slams

When the world goes quiet

You'll know where I am


You could be my open road

You could be the reason why

You could ease my heavy load

But I want to freeze you out now


You can let it shine

Keep that in mind

When they let out a rat next time

You could move a little closer

Until you're leaning all up around my shoulder

See these shadows walk around

When they let the rats out

// Turquoise Boy //

Turquoise boy I must confess to you

Sweet liberation has come

You are a legend in a lovely game

But now I feel I must run


Turquoise boy the sky is calling me

Sweet isolation in the sun

You are a soldier in a sad charade

How can you lose whats never found

// Lights Out //

She scans the room

For a star to consume

When eye contact is made

I suggest son you fix yr grave

[Chorus:]

Its lights out for you

Lights out for you

Theres not a hell of a lot you can do

Its lights out for you


He rolls his eyes

At the thought of paradise

But when he makes that insect sound

Then its time girl for you to leave town

[Chorus]


She scans the room

For a star to consume

When eye contact is made

I suggest son you fix yr grave

[Chorus]

// The Neutral //

He's not a dreamer or a schemer,

Running away from me

He's not a singer, an entertainer

With no follow thru

He's not a poet or a mystic

With his cgarette unglued

He just neutral, and he's weary

Not even brand new.


It's a perfect sin

Close yr eyes and loose the rest

It's a perfect sin

Close yr mind and feel the best


Everyone has a headache

Imprecise , hard to cure

Got a shake it, what ails you

The lines are a blur

Is it a pain in her heart

Dark and gray from the start

You won't seduce me, or attract

Just cause yr a stray


It's a perfect sin

Close yr eyes and loose the rest

It's a perfect sin

Close yr mind and feel the best


Why won't you tell me what's inside yr head

Why won't you show me yr secret bed, secret bed?


He's not a dreamer or a schemer

Running away from you

He's not a singer, an entertainer

With no follow thru

He's not a poet or a mystic

With his cigarette unglued

He 's not a cowboy or a loner with nothing to do

He's neutral yeah he's weary,

Not even brand

He's neutral yea he's weary

And he's so in love with you.

// Pink Steam //

I just come by to run you over

I just come by to see you quiver

You can come you can slip inside babe

Killer eyes and a burnin heart babe


Don't you know you need no other

I'm the man who loves you mother

Open up your arms to me girl

Let me feel your wild heart beat girl


Sweet lips flowers + cream

Deep in love surrender pink steam

Deep in love you need no other

Deep in love yr lonely lover


Feel your wild heart beat

Lonely lover

Open up to me

Lonely mother


Yr sweet lips on mine

Like flowers + cream

O killer eyes

Surrender pink steam

// Or //

In yr mouth a wad of cash

Moist roll of hundreds

Fingers thru yr hair

Silver quarters drop

To yr pleated skirt


Cannisters of whipped cream

In yr sweater pockets

A look of space and total life

Ready or not

The plan is to go to dc and hang out

Go see girls rock

How long's the tour?


What time you guys playing?

Where you going next?

What comes first,

The music or the words?

Illusory landscape, five decades of paint.

Helen Lundeberg...

Illusory landscape, four expressions of elegance, elegance.


Blue river, open door,

Landscape white and orange.

Daybreak by the sea,

A narrow view sloping horizon.

Marina, the poet's road.

Sundial cimerrian landscape,

A quiet place, moon, sea and mist.

Desert road tree in the marsh,

Biological fantasy,

Ocean view, water map,

Ambiguity estuary.

// Eyeliner //

Eyeliner was so cheap

It was free it was easy to steal because no 

Sister would miss it really 

Why would anyone steal it anyway 


You can apply it with the same expertise 

As you have with yr guitar

Just a bit so no one 

Gets too in yr face


Hit the street and go look for Angela 

Licking Angela's thighs back and round and round

Black lined lashes is punk rock sex 

Without all the hangups

Hits are for squares 

And so is money


Burnt english muffin crunches nicely between teeth

With still a whole lotta future to go

Bags of records as currency 

For rent and cigs and electricity 

Shit and phone, prostitutes 

On Chrystie and Delancey 


Think I can afford sex 

In Sara Delano Roosevelt Park? 

Maybe I look like a rich kid 

Or at least some kid with a bit of coin 

They will take it 

I can't even imagine it


Nowhere to go but the back door

Hard boot kick to metal void

Cold beer stench

Speed plowed waitress

Some art rock types working our way

To ice cream and thin sheet glory

A smile on the jesus freak 

Hooked on our show


Burnished hearts blind to

Inevitable madness

Take care of the devil 

Treat him with embrace 

Alive with Mary Magdalene's heart 

Her eyes light the screen, a siren 

Breasts somewhat buttoned

Somewhat busting thru

Next town over and I land into

Exasperated non-finish

Deliver me into tour mode 


Fucking kids crashing thru the woods

Stream language, resilient nature

Ripping thru: stones, rocks

Fallen branch


The chattering skulls of adult nayspeak (grimace)

Dead orange alerts annoy the bedroom gate

The poems, like text-straps, soothe and protect 

And beautify the insect click


City noise, screeching car-things 

Grandmothers in fractured finery 

A perfect day to taste a dog's coat 

Puppy lust, n' luck 


Corrective licking strategies 

She motions for a light curious 

To the invasive fix
