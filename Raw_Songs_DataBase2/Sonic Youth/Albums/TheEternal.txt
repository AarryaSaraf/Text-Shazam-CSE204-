// Sacred Trickster //

I want you to levitate me

Don't you love me yet?

Press up against the amp, turn up the treble

Don't forget


Getting dizzy sittin around

Sacred trickster and the no tech sound


I wish I could be music on a tree

Noise nomads and me

Levitating on the ground

Uh huh uh huh

Uh huh uh huh

Uh huh uh huh

Uh huh uh huh


Whats its like to be a girl in a band?

I don't quite understand

That's so quaint to hear

I feel so faint my dear

Getting dizzy sittin around

Sacred trickster and the no tech sound

I wish I could be music on a tree

Noise nomads and me

Levitating, scootin around

// Anti-Orgasm //

Mission control to brain police

Free love, key energy


Penetration (destroys the party)

Violation (of a cosmic body)

Do you under (stand the problem)

Anti-war (is anti-orgasm)


Smash the war hypocrisy

Mission control key anarchy


Liberation (not your sex slave)

Domination (will you behave)

See how we be (lieve in nothing)

Anti-god (is anti-orgasm)

// Leaky Lifeboat (For Gregory Corso) //

Leaky lifeboat

Sleeps off shore

Now we're sailing backwards

To the freaky north


My brother the wind

He's got to know

We've got to get it together

And blow


Slipping sideways

Get it straight

The siren sonars

Are tempting fate


Fates in a pleasant mood today

I don't get around much, but hey

I got to say

The sun's got to play


La, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la


Leaky lifeboat

Called to shore

You got another

Chance to score


My brother the wind

He's got to know

We've got to get it together

And blow

Before the sun gets cold

Cold to gold


La, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

// Antenna //

My darling cruises the streets for pleasure

Skyscrapers in the dead love dawn

Throbbing blood mind selfless creature

Forever yours and then she's gone

Radios play nothing when she's far away

Tv antenna nothing gone to waste

Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away,

She's far away


Every corner creeping panic

Freak lighting in her abstract mind

Rubber stamps and dreams of cashflow

Wild blood ecstatic crime

Radios play nothing when she's far away

Tv antenna rusting gone to waste

Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away,

She's far away


Every day I feel more like her

Street magic in the burning dawn

Out for blood my selfless lover

Forever yours and then she's gone

Radios play nothing when she's far away

Tv antenna nothing gone to waste

Radio transmitting nowhere it falls away,

She's far away

// What We Know //

I'm in a state of shock

I'm creeping up and down your block

I'm looking into you

I'm trying to catch your view


It's not a quiet meditation

Oh, that you know

Darkness makes the night more cold

That's what we know about me


Satisfied wise child

Creeping heart and frozen perfection

You can touch my hand

I drink a case of you


Heaven's not about your reputation

Yeah, that I know

Forever means the night turns gold

That's what we know about you


It's been quite a ride

With you my sweet, here by my side

Funny how the mountains slide

We're stepping across the great divide

Our bodies vibrate slowly

Yeah, that we know

Bound to give it heart and soul

That's what we know about us

// Calming The Snake //

Come on down, down to the river

Come on down I want to feel you shiver

Dark on the edges, golden on top

Floatin down the river

Yr so hot

Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
[repeat]


Come on down, down to the river

Come on down I want to feel you shiver

The sight of death is sure to deliver,

Come on down I want to hear you quiver

Oh oh ooh

Corpses' drapery

Rusting, sliding, sliding,

Sliding

Endless

// Poison Arrow //

Paintings they fall off the walls when you come

Traipsing in with your horse

Your six string guitar is a mess silver bullets

Hanging off yr dress


Now I remember what I meant to be-to replace

Your history

Who let that girl into this room-so innocent yet

Doomed

[Chorus:]

Who shot the poison arrow


Here she comes-yeh-shes playing hard to get

There she goes-a promise you can never forget


Mirrors, they black out and freeze when you pull

Me in too too deep

Everytime I handcuff you I know I come closer to

The truth


Now I remember whatI meant to say-to count

All my blessings today

Who let that girl into this room-so innocent

Yet doomed

[Chorus]

// Malibu Gas Station //

Malibu gas station

Pumps up the nation

A tough cross to bear

Oops no underwear


Com' on do it

You gotta use it

That a girl

Don't you blow it

Com' on move me

Turn me on now

It will make make you feel so good, yeah


I took the stage to show you

So long ago now

My mind is hazy

Just a little crazy


Com' on do it

You gotta use it

That a girl

Don't you blow it

Com' on move me

Turn me on now

Roll me over

It will make you-


Everybody down, everybody dark,

Crawling on the ground


I can't move faster

My face is plaster

The breasts are bangin

Abdominal master


Com' on do it
[Repeat chorus etc]


Everybody down, everybody dark, crawling on the ground

Movin in the waves, moving in the sand,

Bumping on the ground

Grinding in the water, grinding in the water, feel

The undertow, feel the undertow, whats yrs is

Mine, whats yrs is mine, feel the undertow, oh

Yeah pulling down, pull me down,

In the undertow french kiss, french kiss now


Malibu gas station

On face the nation

California magik

A tan so tragique

// Thunderclap For Bobby Pyn //

We did not fade from the noise meditation

We stopped abruptly while spinning down

This is not to depict hesitation

A silent gesture-for princess pleasure

Oh see what heaven sent -oh stright from

Heavens gate

Oh see what heaven meant-when it embraces

Hate


Elastic dreemz of vicious aktions

Plastik stomachs wrapped in steel

Hair falls in a dead breeze curtain

Trash can canterbury-hollywood boulevard

O u can count on it-richard hell tacked to the

Wall

Remember the plunger pit-in love with nothing

At all


Our beards are circuits to amplifier

All our bells have an elite ring

Rapacious gardens of female distinktion

Can you smell trouble-libraries of rubble

I don't wanna know-who gets the highest score

Thats when my poodle pukes-on the gallery

Floor


We did not fade from the noise meditation

We stopped abruptly while spinning down

Hair falls in a dead breeze curtain

A silent gesture-for princess pleasure

Here comes mary rat-trudi tacked to the wall

Take me back to disgraceland-in love with

Nothing at all

// No Way //

Sweet temptation came today

Time for angels to kneel and pray

I saw you hangin with the devil

Evil nature frozen grave

Renounce yr lies sweet succubi-oh no

I don't care I don't wanna hear it

Cuz I'm not talkin to you no more

And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-

No way


U know u hrt me once

And you know ull never hurt me again

Cuz I'm sick of all yr games

You can't trick my love w/sin

Sinners lie I will never die-I said no

I don't care I don't wanna hear it

Cuz I'm not talking to you no more

And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-

No way


Sweet temptation came today

Time for angels to kneel and pray

Yr black wings r bound in chains

As I swoop into yr grave

Werewolf kommandos poison tongue-I said no

I don't care I don't wanna hear it

Cuz I'm not talkin to you no more

And I'm never gonna shadow yr door-

No way

// Walkin Blue //

Hey now, whats the news?

I heard you've been seen walkin' blue

I know we're all confused, it's ture

I know you feel the same way


Everything we see is clear/everything we feel


I'm here to let you know

All we need to do is just to just let go

You've heard we're "born to lose", I know

But don't you start to think that's really true

You've got the walkin blues today

But soon we'll stand and let the music play


Everything we dream is clear, everything we

Need


Let's say you and I we find/something hard to hold

Let's keep it in our minds

And let it fill our days

Never slip and find we've let it stray

Now we're in for the long ride

We can let the rest slip aside


Everything we need is clear

Everything we feel is clear

Everything we dream is clear

Everything we see is clear

// Massage The History //

Oil dripping on my head

Let's go back to bed

Bring you back to me

Bring you back to me


Oil dripping on my head

Bring you back

From the dead

From the dead

Here's wishing you were here with me

Here's wishing we could massage

History, history

I'm witness to what you do

Anything that you feel

In between, in between

You and me

Bound at sea

Floating on debris

Yr so close, close to me

Yr so close, close to me


Oil dripping on my head

Let's go back to bed

Bring you back

Bring you back

From the dead

From the dead

Wishing you were here by me

Wishing you were here

Let's massage history

All the money's gone

All the money's gone

Funny it was never here

It was never here

Here's a song

Here's a song

To massage along

History along

Come with me

To the other side

Not everyone makes it out alive

Come with me

To the other side not everyone makes it out

Alive

I want you to suck my neck...


Suck

// Pay No Mind //

Tonight the city is full of morgues

And all the toilets are overflowing

There's shopping malls coming out of the walls

As we walk out among the manure


That's why

I pay no mind

I pay no mind

I pay no mind


Give the finger to the rock 'n' roll singer

As he's dancing upon your paycheck

The sales climb high through the garbage-pail sky

Like a giant dildo crushing the sun


That's why

I pay no mind

Sleep in slime

I just got signed


So get out your lead-pipe pipe dreams

Get out your ten-foot flags

The insects are huge and the poison's all been used

And the drugs won't kill your day job...honey


That's why

I pay no mind

I pay no mind

I pay no mind


That's why

I pay no mind
