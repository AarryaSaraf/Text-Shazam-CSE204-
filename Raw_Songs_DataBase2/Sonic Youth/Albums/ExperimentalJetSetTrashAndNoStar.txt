// Winner's Blues //

[Thurston]

...ifor by the away, go out not today (?)

Move back along and wait a long long time

Nothing running free, you gotta time it all

Run out the door come back when you score

New times will come and you will see a door

Into the lion eye and now I'm gone

And it's out

And it's not what you thought it was about

But a life, that you know

Will keep you bound in...


Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

Sometimes you got still the blues for me

I could run away, a long time to stay

Burn out your eyes, burn out surprise

Look out today you know it's not the same

It's all the rage, it's every day

And it's out

And it's not what you thought it was about

But a life, that you know

Will keep you round in love

// Bull In The Heather //

[Kim]

10, 20, 30, 40

Tell me that you wanna hold me

Tell me that you wanna bore me

Tell me that you gotta show me

Tell me that you need to slowly

Tell me that yr burning for me

Tell me that you can't afford me

Time to tell yr dirty story

Time f'r turning over and over

Time f'r turning four leaf clover


Betting on the bull in the heather


10, 20, 30, 40

Tell me that you wanna scold me

Tell me that you a-dore me

Tell me that you're famous for me

Tell me that yr gonna score me

Tell me that you gotta show me

Tell me that you need to sorely

Time to tell yr love story

Time f'r turning over and over

Time f'r turning four leaf clover

Betting on the bull in the heather

// Starfield Road //

[Thurston]

The turbo goes to rocket put yr kiss in my hand

Sensate yr belly down

Bend down round this garbage can

Pow pound down dirty starfield road

A hot ham slap it muscle skin jam load

Blam bam adds explosion to the lamb

Jesus is screaming yr name

Violent loving yeah

Kissing golden, we're going insane

But where is the shame?

When the star pet is to blame

Aah you butt cheeks can't stay

As I spleen my name in flame

// Self Obsessed And Sexxee //

[Thurston]

I remember when you first arrived

Magic marker on yr belly button alright, alright

I read what you said you said drop dead oh no, oh no

We party all night cuz it's you, you, you everyday

Self-obsessed and sexxee all the way

And I will build you up while they put you down

// Bone //

[Kim]

Dry as a bone, take it to heart

Don't look back, you're the one

That's alright, straight from the bone

Walk on by, look to the left

Touched by none, that's alright

That's alright, dark as ink

You are the one, Lord just thirteen

No matter fun, truth never seen 

Dry as a bone, dry as a bone

Hands in yr pants, tied to the tree

Rocked back and forth, hips in the leaves

Thighs in the bark, make me free

That's alright


You are the one, don't look back

Strength from the heart, walk on by

That's alright, that's alright

White boy say, yr just fine

First to the last, take it okay

Momma don't know, walk straight by

Look to the left, you are the one

Poor little bone, shiver inside 

Fast talking walk, bone girl go inside

That's alright, that's alright

Don't look back, push yr hips up

Yr gonna be free, just for a while

// Androgynous Mind //

[Thurston]

Hey sad angel walks, and he talks like a girl

Out trying to think why it stinks, he's not a girl

Now he's kicked in the gut, they fucked him up, just enough

They got me down on my knees, I kiss his ring, God is love


Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind


Hey hey are you gay? are you God?

My brain's a bomb, to turn you on

Everything is all right

God is gay, and you were right


Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind


Hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay [x4]

Hey hey it's okay, hey it's okay [x5]

Hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay [x6]

Aaaaaaaawwwooooooowwwaaaaaaaooo


God said it's all right, for you to fight

To free yr mind

Whose side are you on?

Like a bomb, yr free tonite


Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind

Androgynous mind, androgynous mind


Hey hey it's okay, hey hey it's okay [x4]

Hey hey it's okay, hey it's okay [x5]

Hey hey

// Quest For The Cup //

[Kim]

Yr the thrill of a million

Walking down the sidewalk

Feel like an alarm clock

Woke up and dressed up

Don't look like a t-shirt

I feel just like a donut

Come and take the trash out

What's the use of crying

Don't look like a bummer

Feel just like a burger

Can I make him like me

Do you feel like I do

Don't look like a slip skirt

I feel just like a poser

I don't look like an angel

I GUESS I'll put some jeans on

Make my lips look redder

True you still look better


This is for Lisa


Ran away to the west

Faxed my mom for the test

Couldn't stay for the rest

Then I met him Jess

He is just the best

We kissed right under a tree

I felt so salty free

I felt so salty free

I felt nothing like me


I felt so s-a-lty free

[Tape]

All your dreams will come true, all my dreams came true

But now, I have a bunch of other dreams, ta-dum-dum

It's gotta be hot hot (?)

[Kim]

I felt so s-a-lty free

// Waist //

[Thurston]

Guess who came round today

X-Girl and the girl snoo-pee

Twinkle toes and sparkle eyes

Everything is a new surprise

They're gonna spend some super-cash

Spend it all on the boy-smash

And all the glamour is all the time

Silver jacket and a twist of lime

Well hope you don't waste away

Yeah hope you don't waste away

You better not waste away

Ooh yeah don't waste away

I've seen it happen before

Girl slipping out the door

Sneaking into Agnes B.

Throw away everything

You've been a waste away

You've been a waste away

You've been a waste away, now


Walk up to her and say

I'd love you anyway

Sweet subtle super style

Wonder how to make an angel smile

Don't let me waste away

Don't let me waste away

Don't let me waste away

Don't let me waste away, wow!

// Doctor's Orders //

[Kim]

Take one, to come

Doctor's orders, no more borders

Take one, make some

Feeling bolder, no more disorder


Mother's not to blame

She's feeling no pain

Doesn't feel the drain

She says it's not her brain


All right, no wrong

She used to be cleanin', now she's just dreamin'

She's right, you're wrong

She thinks it's the weather, feels light as a feather


Mother's such a mess

She forgets how to dress

She thinks she's lookin' her best

She's no longer depressed


Take one, bake one

Used to be tragic, now it's like magic

Just one, for fun

Mother's new pet, it's not hard to get


Mother came home today

Wearing a big bouquet

She threw her self away

She's taking up spanish ole

// Tokyo Eye //

[Thurston]

Tokyo eye, Tokyo crying somewhere

Seeking inside, supermen sighing nowhere

Seven to nine, luck is around this sun bear

Fur in the night, Kansai woman goes out

Soak in the eye, Osaka crying for you

Ship in the light, sing in the water sun dew

Ticket to die, ticket to ride the junk star

Shielded in white, Kansai girl in black dew


Tokyo eye, Tokyo crying somewhere

Seeking inside, supermen sighing nowhere

Soaking in my eye, soaking in my eye grey leaf

She dig to cry, she dig to cry love funny

Fur in the eye, Kansai girl is kiss teen

Fun in the light, crying away to sun bear

// In The Mind Of The Borgeious Reader //

[Thurston]

Seaside rever gonna rock the boat

Gonna roll it up fat superdope

Yeah pass it around or stick it on a pin

Boyie lover with the bunny skin (?)

My plastic lady here's a glitter roll

Straight from my heart thu thy soul

Yeah I don't care about dirty hair

All praise due queen and yogi bear

So get back in the boat yeah


Vicarious pleasure in my brain

Fantastic life never the same

Identity come set it free

Come set me out to mystery

Mistert mind yah


Silly rabbit kicks are for kids

Yr carrot souffle's got me on the skids

Don't care about dirty hair

Got a fuzzy finger miss bunny tail

Hip hop till you drop yeah

Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop

// Sweet Shine //

[Kim]

I hear my angel mounted baby

Pretend to everlast a lady

Marlboro belt unbuckled baby

They told me you were just crazy

I feel that I could burst

Gimme a little drink of yr sweet time

Is it the way you think?

Or just a pattern of yr glory

Is it just some story?

You wrote all for me

Do you think yr my home?

Down deep yr just a little whorey

I know you, I'm from you

I know you, I'm from you


Whoooooow

I'm coming home to Swall Drive


Cowboys are languishin'

Little girl's are bees

Is it really a green stage coach

Crawling up to me


I dreamt that you were my vacation

Woke to find desire and dislocation

Yr always heavy in rotation

Coming on, flirting with the nation

I feel that I could burst

Gimme a little drink of yr sweet shine

Why is the way you grew (?)

Still in the soul wanting you (?)

Smelling the nite jasmine

Hypnotises me

The flower tells me stories

That make me sick and free

I know you, I'm from you

I know you, I'm from you


Whoooooow

I'm coming home momma, to Swall Drive


Alice is a chain store

Down past 1st and Vine

You can shop there anytime

It's all very fine

Look his hair is colored, do you think he grows

Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a hose (?)

Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a rose (?)

Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a pose (?)

Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a hose (?)

Look it's changing...
