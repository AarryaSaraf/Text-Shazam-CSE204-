// Surrender My Heart //

So I've been trying hard to open up
When I lost someone it hit me rough
I paid to toughen up in therapy
She said to me, 'soften up'

I'm sorry if I push your good away
Especially when I'm needing you to stay
I know you hate that I still test your love
I'm trying not to fuck this up

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

I used to soldier through my hardest days
I used to switch it off, ignore the pain
I craved to feel it all entirely in your arms, baby

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

I believe in you every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(I believe in you every night)
I believe in you every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(I believe in you every night)

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

// Joshua Tree //

Running from the night
I drove miles away to finally feel alone
There's no moon in sight
But the desert lights could lead the way back home

I'm in the moment
Living undercover
Painting on each other
All the colors
I can't get enough

California dreaming's
Never what it seems but
Here it comes
I know what I must do now

I need it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I feel it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I see it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I know it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I own it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I show it (da, da, da, da, da, da)

Give me paradise
I'll eclipse the stars and fall like once before
I'm like Aphrodite
And it's fine to only know the things I know

I'm in the moment
Living undercover
Painting on each other
All the colors
I can't get enough

California dreaming's
Never what it seems but
Here it comes
I know what I must do now

I need it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I feel it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I see it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I know it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I own it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I show it (da, da, da, da, da, da)

I'm feeling dramatic
I like the moon and the magic
Of this
Oh, I, Oh, I, Oh

I'm feeling dramatic
I like the moon and the magic
Of this
Oh, I, Oh, I, Oh

// Talking To Yourself //

I was always invisible
Consequences are difficult to face
Could've been something beautiful
But you made it impossible to stay

So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind?
What you got on your mind?

Am I keeping you up at night?
Keeping you up at night?
I'll never let you be, no!

Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me, making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your-
Talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself

You were never just miserable
Without taking me with you all the way
Don't it hit you subliminal
Now that I'm not the only one who's taking the blame?

So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind?
What you got on your mind?

Am I keeping you up at night?
Keeping you up at night?
I'll never let you be, no!

Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me, making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your-
Talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to your-

Are you thinking of me?
Does it kill you that you're thinking of me?

Are you thinking of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talking to yourself?
Are you reaching for me, making love to someone else?
Do you talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself, self?
When you're talking to your-
Talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself, self
When you're talking to your-
Talk to me (To me)
When you're talking to yourself

// Far Away //

I'd give this love a second try
First I just imagined all your qualities and that's my fault
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
I'd like to get to know you

Let me kiss all of these tears coming down
I heard a night bird singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Your face is calming me down
Maybe I'll just stop thinking
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Trying not to talk first
'Cause words don't mean authority
And you look powerful just standing tall in front of me
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
I'd like to get to know you

Let me kiss all of these tears coming down
I heard a night bird singing

The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

A night bird singing

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

// Sideways //

Smudged red lipstick on you
I'm so satisfied
We spilled that coffee cup
On my couch a thousand times

Oh now I smile at strangers
I'm that annoying type
Who don't care if there's traffic
Cause I've got plans tonight

Later we'll meet at your place
Later we'll be together ah ah
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything's going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmmm

One more cute disaster
Said, "I love you twice"
Before you could even answer
It's hard here in paradise

I'm living to look at your face
Living it up together
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything's going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmm

Ever since you said la da da da da

// Beach House //

Boy number one made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
(It was good though)

Boy number two had a beautiful face
Highly agreed to go back to his place
His wife really had some impeccable taste
(She was sweet though)

I've been on this ride
This rollercoaster's a carousel
And I'm getting nowhere

Boys around the world
I want to believe that
When you chase a girl
It's not just hunting season
I can see the future, say it like you mean it

"I've got a beach house in Malibu
And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings
I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings
I'm probably gonna hurt your"

Boy number twelve had a look in his eye
Brought up his ex and he started to cry
Told me he loved me the very first night
(Oh, no)

Who knows what I'm in for with
Boy number I can't keep count any more

I've been on this ride
This rollercoaster's a carousel
And I'm getting nowhere

Boys around the world
I want to believe that
When you chase a girl
It's not just hunting season
I can see the future, say it like you mean it

"I've got a beach house in Malibu
And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings"
(I'm probably gonna hurt your)

"I've got a weekend in paradise
And I'm probably gonna never call you"
(I'm probably gonna hurt your)

"I got big plans to take care of you
I just need to borrow ten thousand dollars"
(I'm probably gonna hurt your)

"I've got a lake house in Canada
And I'm probably gonna harvest your organs"
(I'm probably gonna hurt your)

"I've got a beach house in Malibu
And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings"

Boys around the world
I want to believe that
When you chase a girl
It's not just hunting season
I can see the future, say it like you mean it

"I've got a beach house in Malibu
And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings"

// Bends //

Sunshine, somewhere in Mexico
Long day, I didn't feel so good
Lonely, am I being sensitive?
Blue eyes, you were the sensitive one
Just say this isn't happening
Do do do do do do do do do

It's too late for that flight
To see you, how can this be life?
How can this be life?

I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I've cried
Keep it in a sacred place
Hold me in your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too

Moonlight, stars in the water glow
Swim out, baptize me indigo
Just me and all of my cousins know
Blue eyes, we are the sensitive ones
Tell me this isn't happening
Do do do do do do do do do

In tree forts I'll see you
True wild one, where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?
Where's your home tonight?
How can this be life?

And I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I've cried
Oh keep it in a sacred place
Hold me in your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too
But I can feel the sun on you

// Western Wind //

California
It crossed my mind
Once we were pressed into the
Love we were pressed into the breeze up on the mountain
I was by your side

Do you remember
A conversation with our heads against the pillow?
Dust my shoes before I enter through your doorstep
I was on your side

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

A jubilation
A celebration
Take me back into your corner
To the center of the room, we made a dance floor
I was charmed to let go

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

But could you give me peace of mind
If I return to you in time, my golden arrow
Mmm

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

How refreshing you crush all the competition
You can ask me if I'm busy tonight
I could be free for you and me
And maybe we can go for a drive

So light
Keep it easy 'cause I'm kinda independent
But I really need to stay on your mind
No other guy can help me fly
And hold me down at the same time

So nice
Incredibly honest
Polite

Give me all of the reasons

Apple of my eye
He took me by surprise
He swept me off my feet
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons

// Bad Thing Twice //

I don't remember
I don't remember you
I try not to go there
I need a spotless mind

I was born in November
You were born in a different moon
The push and the pull there
What do you want this time

Cross the rivers of my mind
You're my little rock skipper
Skipper, skipper, skipper

Every time I close my eyes
You're my little heart hiccup
Give it up give it up
Yeah

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

A critical
Critical test to me
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Can't stop feeling the rain before the thunder
I thought it through and
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

You were the king and I was a soldier babe
I fought for your attention
Fought for you lonely eyes

I had a vision I had to run away
Let's play this thing over
I wanna go back in time

Cross the rivers of my mind
You're my little rock skipper
Skipper, skipper, skipper

Every time I close my eyes
You're my little heart hiccup
Give it up
Give it up
Yeah

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

A critical
Critical test to me
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Can't stop feeling the rain before the thunder
I thought it through and
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame

// Shooting Star //

I might sleep with you tonight
If you wanna know why
Just because summertime and you look fine
Press my back against the door
Of the refrigerator when the heatwave comes
Ice can't melt how hot we felt

But I still believe in my New York City
Lots to do and the boys so pretty
Can't believe I've been gone so long
We can turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I believe
There's a true connection
With you and me

So I might sleep with you tonight
If you wanna know why, just because
I still believe in my New York City
We could turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

Last chance
You turn to me
I'd like to let, let you get, get to know me
Romance
Walk down the street
I'd like to let, let you get, get to know me

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
We could turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star
I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

Somebody told me that the night's done
If I play the right song we could keep the lights on baby
(Caught my shooting star)
Somebody told me there's a full moon
And if I play the right tune
Would you give me all you
(Caught my shooting star)

// Go Find Yourself Or Whatever //

Tell me that your mind's been changing
I tell you that I'm no good at goodbyes
I could cut a thousand roses
Show you that I'm all torn up inside

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
So go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you

Tell me that we'll meet up someday
I tell you that I'm no good telling lies
Maybe when my heart's done breaking
Then I could forgive what you tried

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
Go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you

You could spend your whole life searching
And I could spend the whole day just getting by
But every time the red moon rises
I'll stay up and I'll keep some hope inside

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
So go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you

// The Loneliest Time //

I've had one of those bad dreams
Where we're standing on your street
I quit smoking those cigarettes
But I'm never getting over it

And you're looking right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
'Bout our story never finished it
'Cause our love we never finished it

I'm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me
If you wanna try, love, if you leave the light on for me
If you wanna try it, if you wanna try it
If you wanna try, love)

I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette

Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save sorry for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right

I'm coming over tonight (Over tonight)
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it)
If you wanna try, love (If you wanna try me)
(If you wanna try, love)
If you wanna try me (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)
If you leave the light on for me (If you wanna try it)
I just need back into (If you wanna try, love)
I just need back into your life (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)

What happened was
We reached the moon
But lost in space I think we got there all too soon
But you know what
I'm coming back for you, baby
I'm coming back for you

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

// Anxious //

I need love to keep me satisfied
But you know, but you know
I want more than what they advertise
And you're so rational

But you didn't even notice (even notice)
I was hoping you would open up (I was hoping)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy, you got a reputation

I get anxious
'Cause I need a little headroom
So damn, baby
Moving over to the bedroom
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy you got a reputation
I get anxious
Moving over to the bedroom

I should cool it off, I know you're tired
But you know (you know), but you know (you know)
But I never take my own advice
And you're so rational

But you didn't even notice
I was jealous of your company
Boy, you got a reputation
(Mmh, mmh)

I get anxious
'Cause I need a little headroom (I need a little headroom)
So damn (so damn), baby
Moving over to the bedroom
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy you got a reputation
(Mmh, mmh)
I get anxious
Moving over to the bedroom
(Mmh, mmh)

Ooh, ooh
Boy, you got a reputation

// No Thinking Over The Weekend //

I was looking for you on the beach
When it's good, was it always out of reach?
In the hotel, someone sent me flowers
Getting dressed now, meet you in an hour

London, sunset ocean
Feeling it, stealing kisses from your neck
Summer haze, the nights are getting hotter
Pick me up when you're ready for the water

Do you think about star signs?
Because I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend
(Our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend
(This love has no limits)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

Holiday, take the train off the track
The windows were closed, so we keep the door open
Everyone waved at us

Do you think about star signs?
Because I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend
(Our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend
(This love has no limits)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

Tried but I couldn't get away (Tried but I couldn't get away with it)
Tried but I couldn't get away (Tried but I couldn't get away with it)
No thinking over the weekend
No thinking over the weekend
I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

// Keep Away //

Hands touch all night, I remember
I stayed behind and you were tender
In my whole life, I wish I never knew this kind of love

I'm keepin' company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy to sever
Think you're onto me
Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too

I, I'm tryin' to keep away from you
Gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you
I can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you

Wake up this time, it's now or never
You've made your mind up and I surrender
My heart was blind, I wish I never knew this kind of love

I'm keepin' company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy to sever
Think you're onto me
Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too
It takes all of my pride

I, I'm tryin' to keep away from you
We're gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you
I can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you

(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away (Been tryin' to keep away from you)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away (Been tryin' keep away from you)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Wakin' up, makin' up for the lost time
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Close the door, I've been yours for the longest time
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)

Keep away, away, keep away, away
God, I miss your hands over my body
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away
God, I miss your hands over my body
Keep away, away, keep away, away
