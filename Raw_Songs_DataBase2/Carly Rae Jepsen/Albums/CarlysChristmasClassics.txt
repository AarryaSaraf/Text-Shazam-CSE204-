// It's Not Christmas Till Somebody Cries //

It's not Christmas, no-oh-oh
It's not Christmas, no-oh-oh
It's not Christmas
Till somebody cries

Everybody made it home for Christmas Eve
Tried to keep it cool around the Christmas tree
Every year we sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas till somebody cries

My boyfriend is a vegan, so they fed him fish
My uncle made it worse by talking politics
I had a few opinions might have started a fight
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
Till we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year

Grandpa ate the gummies that we meant to hide
We tried to play it off like it's a holiday high
He unwrapped all the presents and he ruined the surprise
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody

Breaks into argument, ooh I used to fight it
We get emotional too, I won't deny it
I used to hide in my room but now I like it
Cause it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
Till we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year

It's not Christmas
Till somebody cries
Till somebody cries

Waking up too early in my childhood bed
The nieces and the nephews jumping on my head
They keep on asking questions like, "Is Santa a lie?"
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
It's not Christmas (Have a holly jolly)
Secret is to sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas till somebody cries (Till somebody cries)
It's not Christmas till somebody cries (No, it's not Christmas)
It's not Christmas till somebody cries

// Last Christmas //

I gave you my heart
Merry Christmas

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
It's been a year, you know it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
Merry Christmas, I love you and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Special
Special
Special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Special
Special
Special
Special

// Let It Snow //

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since with no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
Since the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear is still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

// Mittens //

Home tonight
Rest my head
In my single childhood bed
Close my eyes
Count to three
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through
The loneliness of Christmas Eve

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

By my table I survive
Fix the make-up from my eyes
Fake a smile so they won't see
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through
The loneliness of winter

See, I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

Shout your name
Through the snow storm, baby
You can break me to the bone, oh
I was wrong, you were wrong to make me
Feel like I was all alone

Walking through my old home town
No one else but me around
Make an angel in the snow
Pray that I can let you go

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
(Your strongest pair of mittens)
Your warmest pair
Your strongest
(Something to get me through)
Your warmest pair
(The loneliness of winter, see)

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
