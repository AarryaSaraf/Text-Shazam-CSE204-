// First Time //

Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time

Catching tears like raindrops here in the glass
Keep them safe in case you should ever ask
Or if you'd like, we don't need to talk about it
I don't care
I will wait right here by my windowsill
For the sun to come, if it ever will
Everyone says I can never get my fill, but I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye
Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye

Looking back, I followed you everywhere
We were kids just playing with truth and dare
Let's be honest
No one else can take me there, but I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye
Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye

Don't you?
I hope that you want to make it up and start it over
Don't you?
I hope that you want to make it up and start it over

(I don't really think any of this is easy)
Feels like the first time

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye (Yeah, yeah)
We'll make it feel like the first time (Oh-oh-oh, feels like the first time)
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye

// Fever //

Don't tell me this is how it ends
A burning fever that I caught from you
My breath was lost when you said "friends"
Well, that could work but I'm still hot for you

So I stole your bike
And I rode all night
But I'm so damn scared
You don't even care

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

I've still been sleeping at my friend's
Dropped off your helmet and lock for me
I wrote some things I didn't send
Three words to say that meant a lot to me

So I rode your bike
To your house last night
And I'm so damn scared
'Cause your car's not there

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight

You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

// Higher //

I was lost
Alone, and searchin'
For someone who understands me for who I really am
Didn't know that I was hurtin'
'Til you lift me up inside
Finally opened up my eyes, oh

If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

You take me higher than the rest (Hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey) hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher

Took some time
A few mistakes, but
You quite didn't show me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound, yeah

If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

You take me higher than the rest (Hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey) hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher

Oh, yeah your love (Hey) turns me on (Hey)
Gets me higher (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (Hey) takes me up (Hey)
Gets me higher (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (Hey) turns me on (Hey)
Gets me higher (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, yeah your love (Hey) takes me up (Hey)
Gets me higher

You take me higher than the rest (Hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (Oh-oh-oh-oh) (Second best, second best)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher 
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher 
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igh (Hey), hi-i-igher 
Oh, you got me

// The One //

Truth is I never thought of us together
You're just a friend of mine
We should know better, this can't last forever
But kiss me one more time

Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny, but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

While cookin' dinner, I'd wear your socks and slippers
It's been a long, long day
It's just so easy
Love the way you read me
I never have to say

Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love

If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

// Body Language //

I think I'm in trouble, I can't see the end
I call you my lover, you call me your friend
I'm keeping it secret, yeah even from you
I call you my lover, oh what can I do?

I've been lonely baby, I
I've been hangin' on the line
(Been hangin' on the line)
And if you love me baby, don't
Don't, don't hang up this time

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, I think we're overthinking it

This could be perfect, that we could be free
To do what we wanted, you do it to me
We only just started, don't say it's the end
So call me your lover, don't call me your friend

I've been lonely baby, I
I've been hangin' on the line
(Been hangin' on the line)
And if you love me baby, don't
Don't, don't hang up this time
Cause you know

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, I think we're overthinking it
Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it, don't think it over

I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over
I just think we're overthinking it
Don't think it over

Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
I think we're overthinking it

// Cry //

You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry
Don't need a moon, I've got your spotlight

I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

Wake up without you
Flooding my room, I see your headlights
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it alright

I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y

You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry

He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Cry-y-y

// Store //

Sunlight, moves upon my skin
Wake up and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
But you know me, I'm

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going, oh, I
Can't talk about it, can't talk about it 'cause

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

Don't cry
I can't play pretend
Wish it hadn't come to this
But you know there's some things you can't mend
But you know me, I'm

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going, oh, I
Can't talk about it, can't talk about it 'cause

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

Alright, if it's alright with you
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
Alright, if it's alright with you
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"

I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly

I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

// Roses //

Knock on the door, leaving it open
It wasn't you, why was I hoping?
Said it before and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend

I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move, all that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

Cat got your tongue, it's been forever
Have you been good? Have you been better?
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend

I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move, all that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

Burnt out cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
Baby, cover me
Hold the afterglow
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go

And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

Burnt out cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
I won't take it back
Dancing in the dark
I won't take it back
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
I won't take it back
Baby, cover me
Hold the afterglow
Please don't let me go
