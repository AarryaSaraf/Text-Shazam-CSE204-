Album: Emotion

// Run Away With Me //

You're stuck in my head
Stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get out of here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Oh baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Oh baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
(We could turn the world to gold, oh-oh)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Oh (Oh), oh

Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (Oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (Just run away)
Run away with me (With me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) Baby
Every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me

// E·MO·TION //

Be tormented by me babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cool and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me

Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can't forget me

Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it (What if I turn the lights right down?)
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

// I Really Like You //

I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
(Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

// Gimmie Love //

Worlds fly by
Drove by your place, and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
I can't lie
I like the feeling how you make me shy
I'll share my secrets, and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two

Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

Eyes so bright
You've got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn, but still, I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
But when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat break in two
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Fall into me and then

Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love (Gimmie love)
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please (Oh please)
'Cause I want what I want, but with you, it's what I need (Oh)
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

Gimmie love (Oh)
It's the way we are together (Oh)
Wanna feel like this forever, forever (Oh)
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever say forever

Gimmie love (Gimmie love)
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch (oh, touch me)
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much? (Too much)
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love (Gimmie love, gimmie love)
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
(Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love)
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love (Gimmie love)

// Making The Most Of The Night //

You and me, we've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down, know what you need to get you high
Top down, like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside, all of your fears, leaving them behind

Here I come now
Baby I'm speeding and red lights I'll run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you, get you, get you

I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night

Eyes wide, like you've never seen the ocean never seen the tides
No hope, now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off, got your hands in the air and you're feeling alright
Gold mines glisten on the skin for you and I

Here I come now
Baby I'm speeding and red lights I'll run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you, get you, get you

I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night

Now, baby take my hand now, don't you cry
I won't let you stay here, I won't let you hide
No more tears, don't waste another day, oh, no, another day
Go on and fight, don't lay down to die, don't lay down to die
Come on get up, you'll make it through okay
Come on get up, don't waste another day

I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I come I'm 'a hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
We're making the most of the night

We're making the most of the night (Oh)
We're making the most of the night (Oh)

// Your Type //

I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine

But I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head

But I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me, when I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you (Time for you)

I love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head

I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend

I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you (Time for you)

// Let's Get Lost //

I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to up and run
When someone said they needed me

But you
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

Baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

I was always shy and careful
Always sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently

But you
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

Oh baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

Let's get lost (Let's get lost)
You wanna get lost? (You wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (Let's get lost)
I wanna get lost

Oh baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed (Oh)
That maybe you'll take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Baby, let's take the long way home

// LA Hallucinations //

I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to LA
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever

But money makes your whole world spin
'Til everything is dizzying
And suddenly

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations

Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night, he and I
Filling up each other's pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes

We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game
'Cause suddenly

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations

BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?
BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, then will you let me go?

Planes, I'm hopping

// Warm Blood //

I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
And I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling, falling
You catch me when I'm falling, falling for you

I saw myself tonight
Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

And I cannot control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles in your warm blood

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

Warm blood, underneath my skin (For you)
Warm blood, my heart is pumping (For you)
Warm blood (Warm blood), underneath my skin
Warm blood (Warm blood), my heart is pumping (Warm blood)

Warm blood, warm blood
Warm blood, warm blood
Warm blood, warm blood
Warm blood, warm blood

// When I Needed You //

Hey

What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear

You come to me in dreams at night
(You come to me in dreams at night)
I wake up and I see the light

Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed someone?
When I needed you? (Hey)
When I needed you? (Hey)

Once upon a time I
Thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kiss me like a sunrise
My feet up to my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself

Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed someone?
When I needed you? (Hey)
When I needed you? (Hey)

You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night

I don't want to work it out
I'm not goin' to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No I'm not going to still

Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone, when I needed someone?
When I needed (Hey)
When I needed (Hey, hey)
When I needed you (You, hey)
When I needed you (You, hey)
When I needed you (Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey) When I needed

// Black Heart //

I don't care about your good intentions
I care more about your bad dreams
I want a love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be

Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me
You're my miracle, oh-oh-oh
Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me
'Cause you're my miracle, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Waiting, oh

You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You're a cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me

Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me
You're my miracle, oh-oh-oh
Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me
'Cause you're my miracle, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Waiting, oh

In your black heart is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart is where you'll find me
Waiting

Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)

Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)

// I Didn't Just Come Here To Dance //

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

It's your fault
Baby boy, 'cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light
With your eyes onto me in the darkness

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance

Baby, I
I'm not going anywhere without you
Walk me home
'Cause I like every single thing about you

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

// Favourite Colour //

Hold on now
This is gettin' kinda serious
This is gettin' kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathin' heavy when it's just a kiss
This is gettin' kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands

Please don't go
Look real close
Eyes that show
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's gettin' hard to slow down now
Got me feelin' like it's real for sure
This is gettin' kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head

'Cause when I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up

Please don't go
Look real close
(Paint me up, me up, me up)
Eyes that show
(Paint me up, me up, me up)
Kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other (Into you)
When I'm close to you (Baby)
We blend into my favourite colour (You're my favorite color)
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other

Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
(Oh) Paint me up, me up, me up
(Wake me up, wake me up, baby)
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour

// Never Get To Hold You //

Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it, darling
Sweet, like the morning light
Goes late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it

Until I saw you in my thunderstorm, I didn't see you
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, babe

Oh, sugar, sugar, spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you 'til the morning light
'Cause, oh darling, don't you know
My only heart is beating for you
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it

Until I saw you in my thunderstorm, I didn't see you
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you)

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, babe

But I don't think that anybody understands you the way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to your head if I say I'll stay
I don't think that anybody understands you the way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to your head if I say I'll stay

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, baby

// Love Again //

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Stars, won't you shine on me?
Won't you dance with me?
Me and my baby
Life, it's enough to cry
It's a lot to give and it's driving me crazy

I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even though my love is true
I know that we can't be together

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you, their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Moon, where's the man in you?
Show the way to us
The sky is turning black now
Moon, what you trying to do
It's too late for us, and there's no turning back now

I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even though my love is true
I know that we can't be together

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you, their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you, their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again
You'll learn to love again

// I Really Like You (Liam Keegan Remix) //

I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I need to tell you something [x5]
But I need to tell you something
Do you want me too? [x3]

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by thread, baby

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
Do you want me?
Do you want me too? [x2]

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something

(YEAAAAAAH!) I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you (Oh, oh, ohh!)
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too? 
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
