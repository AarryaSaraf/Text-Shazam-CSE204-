On the road for half the year
And I can't remember loneliness
And it feels like that says something about you
Or something 'bout me
Performance and the after party
And it took a little time I guess
But I found that I'm not thinking about you
Or thinking 'bout us

Then we pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go
Driving all night to make that show
I'll be a whole new girl tomorrow
It's a new city, so pretty, eyes closed

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band
Just me and the boys in the band

Now and then a memory sparks
Like violins still break my heart
And I feel that says something about you
Or something about me
One day we will meet as friends
But I am not good at pretending
You were so good at pretending

Hey, but now I pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go
Driving all night to make that show
I'll be a whole new girl tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, eyes closed

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

So just take me to the stage
It's been home from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I've got the summer heart!
So just take me to the stage
It's been lit from the start
I need the summer heart
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)
Just me and the boys in the band

We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah (hey!)
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band (With the boys in the band)
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

So just take me to the stage
It's been home from the start (hey!)
Summer nights, summer days (Just me and the boys)
I've got the summer heart (hey!)
So just take me to the stage
It's been lit from the start
Just me and the boys in the band (hey!)

On the road for half the year
And "Real Love" is just a song I guess
And it feels like that says something about you
Or something about me
