You're stuck in my head
Stuck in my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get out of here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Oh baby (Hey), take me to the feeling (Hey)
I'll be your sinner in secret (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Oh baby (Hey), every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, oh
(Run away with me, run away with me)
(We could turn the world to gold, oh-oh)
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Oh (Oh), oh

Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (Oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (Just run away)
Run away with me (With me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) Baby
Every single minute (Hey)
I'll be your hero and win it (Hey)
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Run away with me, run away with me
