I might sleep with you tonight
If you wanna know why
Just because summertime and you look fine
Press my back against the door
Of the refrigerator when the heatwave comes
Ice can't melt how hot we felt

But I still believe in my New York City
Lots to do and the boys so pretty
Can't believe I've been gone so long
We can turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I believe
There's a true connection
With you and me

So I might sleep with you tonight
If you wanna know why, just because
I still believe in my New York City
We could turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

Last chance
You turn to me
I'd like to let, let you get, get to know me
Romance
Walk down the street
I'd like to let, let you get, get to know me

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
We could turn it on

Just sweat
All my fears away
Dancing through the dark
Saw your angel face
Caught my shooting star
I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

I got you now, I'm Scorpio
It's physical, it's natural
My spiritual, my animal
Caught my shooting star

Somebody told me that the night's done
If I play the right song we could keep the lights on baby
(Caught my shooting star)
Somebody told me there's a full moon
And if I play the right tune
Would you give me all you
(Caught my shooting star)
