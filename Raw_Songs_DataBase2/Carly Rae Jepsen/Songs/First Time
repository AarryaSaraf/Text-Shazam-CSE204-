Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time

Catching tears like raindrops here in the glass
Keep them safe in case you should ever ask
Or if you'd like, we don't need to talk about it
I don't care
I will wait right here by my windowsill
For the sun to come, if it ever will
Everyone says I can never get my fill, but I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye
Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye

Looking back, I followed you everywhere
We were kids just playing with truth and dare
Let's be honest
No one else can take me there, but I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye
Through all the heartbreak, we'll make it feel like the first time
First time
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye

Don't you?
I hope that you want to make it up and start it over
Don't you?
I hope that you want to make it up and start it over

(I don't really think any of this is easy)
Feels like the first time

'Cause when my heart breaks, it always feels like the first time
First time
But if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye (Yeah, yeah)
We'll make it feel like the first time (Oh-oh-oh, feels like the first time)
And if you stay here, we could kiss away the goodbye
Goodbye
