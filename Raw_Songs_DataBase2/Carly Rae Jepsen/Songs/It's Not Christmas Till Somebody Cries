It's not Christmas, no-oh-oh
It's not Christmas, no-oh-oh
It's not Christmas
Till somebody cries

Everybody made it home for Christmas Eve
Tried to keep it cool around the Christmas tree
Every year we sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas till somebody cries

My boyfriend is a vegan, so they fed him fish
My uncle made it worse by talking politics
I had a few opinions might have started a fight
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
Till we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year

Grandpa ate the gummies that we meant to hide
We tried to play it off like it's a holiday high
He unwrapped all the presents and he ruined the surprise
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody

Breaks into argument, ooh I used to fight it
We get emotional too, I won't deny it
I used to hide in my room but now I like it
Cause it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
Till we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year

It's not Christmas
Till somebody cries
Till somebody cries

Waking up too early in my childhood bed
The nieces and the nephews jumping on my head
They keep on asking questions like, "Is Santa a lie?"
Well, it's not Christmas till somebody cries

It's not Christmas
It's not Christmas (Have a holly jolly)
Secret is to sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas till somebody cries (Till somebody cries)
It's not Christmas till somebody cries (No, it's not Christmas)
It's not Christmas till somebody cries
