(I can see)

Sweet talker, I'm not gonna stop you
You talk so sweet, and man, it's dribbling like honey
It's just one taste, I see what you're tryna to do
Ooh-ooh, yeah yeah
It's hot, stakes are getting higher
No love for free, man, it costs if you're the buyer
My life's for me, I see what you're tryna do
Oh-oh, c'mon

Lazy lover, won't you slide me through your
Slide me though your
Lazy lover, I will, slide me through your window and I'll give you
All the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryna to do

That's a nice a house
I like what you've done with the place
Your gingerbread and that greedy smile upon your face
I can see just what you're tryna do
Oh-oh, c'mon

Lazy lover, won't you slide me through your
Slide me though your
Lazy lover, I will, slide me through your window and I'll give you
All the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

But don't worry, I say get it over with
'Cause what you want to know
You've got it on your fingertips
Don't you ask for more
That wave just tumbles me 'round
'Til I'm lost somewhere, but baby
I can't make a sound

It's so unfortunate
But I've already been through this
And I can see just what you're tryna do (Oh, oh)
I can see just what you need to do (I've already been through this)
I can see (just what you're tryna do)
