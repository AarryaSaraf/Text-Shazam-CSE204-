Home tonight
Rest my head
In my single childhood bed
Close my eyes
Count to three
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through
The loneliness of Christmas Eve

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

By my table I survive
Fix the make-up from my eyes
Fake a smile so they won't see
Wish that you were here with me

Last year when my hands were cold
You were always there to hold

So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
Something to get me through
The loneliness of winter

See, I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please

Shout your name
Through the snow storm, baby
You can break me to the bone, oh
I was wrong, you were wrong to make me
Feel like I was all alone

Walking through my old home town
No one else but me around
Make an angel in the snow
Pray that I can let you go

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
(Your strongest pair of mittens)
Your warmest pair
Your strongest
(Something to get me through)
Your warmest pair
(The loneliness of winter, see)

I fell for you, like crazy
And I can't get thoughts of you, from me
So give me your warmest pair
Your strongest pair of mittens, please
