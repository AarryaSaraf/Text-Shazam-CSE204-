My lover don't mind if
I follow him 'round
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this is temporary, I don't even mind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

And now that he noticed
I follow him 'round
He's all kinds of hardness and heartless
But I know he's down

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this is temporary, I don't even mind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

I just wanna stay
Another night, another day
We could wash the world away
We could play like children play

Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
(Moon in the water and the open sky)
Ooh, ooh
Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
(Moon in the water and the open sky)
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
