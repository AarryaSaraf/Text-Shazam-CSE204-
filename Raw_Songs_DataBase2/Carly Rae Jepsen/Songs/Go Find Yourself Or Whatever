Tell me that your mind's been changing
I tell you that I'm no good at goodbyes
I could cut a thousand roses
Show you that I'm all torn up inside

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
So go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you

Tell me that we'll meet up someday
I tell you that I'm no good telling lies
Maybe when my heart's done breaking
Then I could forgive what you tried

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
Go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you

You could spend your whole life searching
And I could spend the whole day just getting by
But every time the red moon rises
I'll stay up and I'll keep some hope inside

You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever

I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
So go find yourself or whatever
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you
