Baby, I could praise you
Try to turn your head around
Could you take a compliment? Oh, oh, oh
Everything I say, you
I find a way to drown it out
Make it like an argument

I see you a different way
So take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep you wantin' more

I know you're not sleepin'
Thinkin' that the sky could fall
You never let the dreams get in, oh, oh, oh
The secrets that you're keepin'
Well, I want you to share them all
'Cause, baby, I can handle it

Just hold my hand a different way
And take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Not just anybody
Keep you wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
God, I love your body
Keep me wantin' more
Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep me wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
