Flying kites
With boy wonder
Hold tight
To me all summer
Reading my
Magazines
Dancing
In my blue jeans
Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
For everybody to see
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light

(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
Save the light

Fireworks
And night streamers
Baby blue
With the day dreamers
Under water
Close to me
Hold my breath
In my blue jeans

Pucker up in sunglasses
Making love to the flashes
Posing the way that we do
For everybody to see
Pull over through your lashes
Only thing that will last is
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me
I take a picture of you
Taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save

I wanna live
Tonight
I wanna save
The light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live
We wanna live

I wanna live
Tonight
I wanna save
The light
And it goes on and on and on
And we go on and on and on
I wanna live
We wanna live

And tonight
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me
And tonight
I take a picture of you taking a picture of me

Tomorrow always happens too soon
I wish I had an electric moon
To save the light
