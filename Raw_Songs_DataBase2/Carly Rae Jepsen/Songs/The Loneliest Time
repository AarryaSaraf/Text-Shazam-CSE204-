I've had one of those bad dreams
Where we're standing on your street
I quit smoking those cigarettes
But I'm never getting over it

And you're looking right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
'Bout our story never finished it
'Cause our love we never finished it

I'm coming over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it, if you wanna try me
If you wanna try, love, if you leave the light on for me
If you wanna try it, if you wanna try it
If you wanna try, love)

I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette

Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save sorry for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right

I'm coming over tonight (Over tonight)
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes (Look in your eyes)
'Cause we've had the loneliest time (Loneliest time)

I'm thinking all through the night (All through the night)
I could be yours just like before
Rewrite another try
'Cause we've had the loneliest time

(If you wanna try it)
If you wanna try, love (If you wanna try me)
(If you wanna try, love)
If you wanna try me (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)
If you leave the light on for me (If you wanna try it)
I just need back into (If you wanna try, love)
I just need back into your life (If you leave the light on for me)
(If you wanna try it)

What happened was
We reached the moon
But lost in space I think we got there all too soon
But you know what
I'm coming back for you, baby
I'm coming back for you

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?

And in the morning
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?
