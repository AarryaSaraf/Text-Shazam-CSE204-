// Keep This Heart In Mind //

I heard you say
life can't go on this way
and you need to change your view.
So you packed up and moved out of my life.
To find a world of your own.
Even now that you've up and gone.
For you there's still a place in my heart
only real love in my life
That even time can't erase.

So darlin'
Keep this heart in mind
whenever the lights of love don't shine.
Darlin' keep this heart in mind
everytime.

I knew you cared
Cause in your letters you would write and say
that you missed my lovin' every day.
Well if that's true,
all I'd ever why
aren't you next to me.
And you call me on the telephone
afraid because you're all alone
Well, Baby, just remember
Oh love will abide

So darlin'
Keep this heart in mind
whenever the lights of love don't shine.
Darlin' keep this heart in mind
everytime.

// River Of Tears //

I guess you got me in a sentimental mood
Never thot I'd feel this way again
Lyin' here with my dreams
I get so lonely thinking of you

[Chorus:]
River of Tears
Oceans of heartbreak
I want to feel
What your love can be
I close my eyes

Chances that I take
Got me so blind
Til I can't see
I never let you know just what's been on my mind
Never thot I'd hurt so bad for you lovin' this long
Lyin' here at nite alone
I keep on wonderin' just what went wrong

[Chorus]

River of Tears
River of Tears

[Chorus]

// Can't Get Enough //

Come on so tough
When you think you got a right
Make love so rough
Until I lose the will to fight
You got that somethin', baby
That turns my darkness into light
And I can't get enough of your love

I never found a man
Who took the time to see
The woman that I am
And not the one he hoped I'd be
And I think we're onto somethin'
And it's good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your...

Aha haaa

Come on so tough
Baby, you know just how to please
You got that stuff
That brings this woman to her knees
I think we're onto somethin'
That is good enough for me
I just can't get enough of your...
I just can't get enough of your...
And I just can't get enough of your love

Can't get enough of your love, aha
Can't get enough of your love
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love, aha
Just can't get it
Can't get enough of your love...

// Let's Keep It Between Us //

Let's keep it between us
These people meddling in our affairs
They're not our friends
Let's keep it between us
Before the whole door closes
And it comes to an end

They'll tell you one thing, me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh darlin', let's keep it between us

Let's keep it between us
We've been through too much together
That they'll never share
They've had nothing to say to us before
Now all of a sudden it's as if
They've always cared

All we need is honesty
A little humility and trust
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us?

I know we're not perfect
Then again, so what!
Ain't no reason to treat you like a snake
Or to treat me like a slut
And it's makin' me so angry!

Could we just lay back for a moment
Before we wake up and find ourselves
In a game that we both have lost?
These easy cures and easy handsomes
Somethin' tells me we can't afford the cost

There's some things not fit for human ears
Some things don't need to be discussed
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us?

[Instrumental break]

They'll tell you one thing, me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh darlin', let's keep it between us

Let's keep it between us
Before the whole thing breaks down
And goes too far
If we can't settle our differences by ourselves
Then we must be worse off than they think we are

Back seat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel
But they sure know how to make a fuss
Oh darlin', can we keep it between us? 
Can we keep it between us?

// Me And The Boys //

Just a bunch of guys getting in the car
No matter who's driving or for how far
Feels so good, (it's) been so long
No backseat drivers tell us how to drive
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Me and my buddies just like to go
We'll have fun (We're having fun); Everybody knows
We don't fuss and we never cry
We just groove, taking in the sights
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Don't raise questions 'bout how it's done
We're just messing 'round, having fun
(The) car gear shiftin' well up and down
The muffler's a little loud, but we love that sound
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
It ain't like us to hang around this town
Cause squares just bring us down
I've got to find me something new
(I) don't wan' think about what they do now
The future's gonna drive around, and we don't care
'Cause wherever we're going, we'll soon get there
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys
Me and the boys
Just me and the boys

// I Can't Help Myself //

[Chorus:]
Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself
Can't help myself
I'm falling in love

Billy was a friend of mine
We used to walk down by the river
And he'd hold my hand
We were only ten or twelve years old
Didn't know about love
I found out
That it could hurt ya so

[Chorus]

Jimmie was the one in high school days
We used to drive around the city
Thinking we'd grown up
Must've been just about sweet sixteen
I found a brand new world,
A brand new love
That I had never seen

[Chorus]

No matter how hard I try
I just can't leave it alone
No use in wonderin' why
'Cause my heart has a mind of its own

[Chorus]

But I keep on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself

I keep on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love

I keep right on falling

Can't help myself
I'm falling in love
I can't help myself...

// Baby Come Back //

Come back
Baby come back

Come back
Baby come back

This is the first time until today
That you have gone away
I'm asking you for the first time
Love me and love that stay

Stay, stay, stay, Yeeeah

Come back
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back

There is no use in crying
Because I'm more hurt than you
I shouldn't have been a virgin
But now my love is true

Uh, (yeah), uh, (all right), uh, yeah

Come back
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back

Come back baby, don't you leave me
Baby baby don't you go
I want you to give me a second chance
You know I love you so (yeah)

Oh (all right), oh (come out), oh yeah

Come back
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back

Oh, won't you please come back (auh)

Come back
Baby come back
I said, baby come back
Oh, won't you please come back

Come back (don't wait too long)
I said, baby come back (oh yes)
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back

// Talk To Me //

The time has come
Before our yesterday is here
I said, the time has come now baby
For you and me to get a few things clear

I might be right or I might be wrong
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong
I might be rich I might be poor
Please don't ya ever close that door

Come home and talk to me
Tell me what is on your mind
You better tell me baby
Tell me while there's still enough time

Well I gave you everything that I had
Now you're sayin' you're a little bit mad at me
I taught ya everything I knew
There ain't too much more I can do for you
You feel there's somethin' wrong?
Then you'll have to tell me it's wrong

You know it too
There's somethin' wrong with you
Don't hold it in
Come on baby, I'm still your friend

Why don't you talk to me 
Tell me what is on your mind
Now ya better tell me baby
Tell me while there's still enough time

[Guitar break]

I might be right or I might be wrong
What does it matter if I'm weak or strong
I might be rich I might be poor
Please don't ya ever close that door

Come home and talk to me
Tell me what is on your mind
You better tell me baby
Tell me while there's still enough time

// Green Lights //

Any old time
You got your tuned in
Baby by your side
And your pretty little cool ride
It feels so good
You got the top pulled in
Wind in your hair
Destination you don't care

Now move it on up
You know it's steerin' all rite
Foot's to the floor
But you think that you can domore
Wind shield clean
And the nite is so brite
Baby so near
And She's givin' you a green lite

Great sound on the radio
She feels something
Now you know there's no place that you'd rather be

Great sounds..

Any old time
You got your tuned in
Baby by your side
And your pretty little cool ride
