// I Will Not Be Broken //

That was then this is now
Found my way back here somehow
Knew you'd have to let me go
Told you once I told you so

Take me down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But I know where I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken
I will not be...

Someone other than who I am
I will fight to make my stand
Cause what is livin' if I can't live free
What is freedom if I can't be me

Take me down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But I know where I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken
I will not be...

I won't let you near it
I will let my spirit fly
Fly
High
Oh take me down

Take me down
You can hold me but you
Can't hold what's within
Pull me round
Push me to the limit
Maybe I may bend
But I know where I'm not going
I will not be broken
I will not be broken
I will not be...

// God Was In The Water //

God was in the water that day
Pickin' through the roots and stones
Trippin' over sunken logs
Tryin' not to make his presence known

God was in the water that day
Wadin' in careful steps
Bubbles risin' from his feet
Comin' up from the muddy depths

Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the shadows
Castin' out a line but no one's biting

I am at my pitiful desk
Starin' at he colorless walls
Wishin' I was any place else
Down into a dream I fall

Sittin' in a tiny boat
Driftin' on the mindless sea
And if I disappear
At least I'm floating free

Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the darkness
Castin' out a line but no one's biting

God was in the air that day
Breathin' out a haunted breeze
Tryin' not to make a sound
Shufflin' through the dried up leaves

God was in the air that day
Circlin' like a drunken hawk
Sweepin' with a hungry eye
Over the ground I walk

Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the darkness
Castin' out a line but no one's biting

Castin' out a line
Castin' out a line to the shadows
Castin' out a line but no one's biting

// Love On One Condition //

I might forgive, but I won't forget
Believe me, baby
You swear you changed your ways
You ain't proved it yet

Well my friends try and tell me
Say that I must be mad
If I'm gonna take you back
After the pain I've had
Well, I explain my position
That I made my decision
I'll grant you love on one condition
Love on one condition

Do me right, don't do me wrong
Come home every night, no more carryin' on
I explain my position
I'll grant you love on one condition

Well my friends try and tell me
Say that I must be mad
If I'm gonna take you back
After the pain I've had
Well, I explain my position
That I made my decision
I'll grant you love on one condition
Love on one condition

// So Close //

So far
There was not a second thought
No heart
Ever got close enough
You are
Watching as I am caught
In a moment off-gaurd

So close
I can nearly taste it
Suppose
This is that one promised love
God knows
All that I've wasted now
Never letting it start

Now all my resistance
I feel it slip away
Now all of the distance
Ever less with every day by day

So far
There was no connection
No spark
Out of which a fire grows
I start
In your direction I'm
Ever so close

Now all my resistance
I feel it slip away
Now all of the distance
Ever less with every day by day

So far, I have never been
So close

// Trinkets //

When I was a kid
I had a little record
I played it over and over
Each and every day.
Sung by a man
Named Louie Armstrong.
Saint's marched right in from my Close and Play.

When I was a kid
I had a little picture
And I looked at that picture
All the time.
Painted by a man
Mama said his name was Vinnie.
A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day.

Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like
To help 'em be happy
Like that guy named Mike.
Yeah that groovy old man that fixes my bike
Down there on 'Dumaine Street, New Orleans Louisiana.

When I was a kid
I had a little wiener dog
I loved that little wiener dog
And she loved me.
Spent warm spring days feeding that little wiener dog
Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree.

(An') if I ever get older, if I ever die.
If I get to a gate at the end of the sky.
And a beautiful creature says
Now Bonnie what do you want?
Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog swear to God.

Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want
To help 'em be happy
Like that ol' gal named Betty.
Yeah that groovy old chick teaches Tai-Chi on the levee.
Rain or shine she's out there she's dedicated.
She wrinkled but she
Lovely.
She flexible and don't you wish we all were flexible enough to
Dance now?

Dance little children now
The whole round world is your neighborhood.
Dance little children now
Nekkid as a Jaybird.
Dance little children now
The whole round world is your neighborhood.
Dance little children now
Nekkid as a Jaybird.

They're just trinkets.
Little stepping stones
To let you know you was here.

// Crooked Crown //

I could say what I mean
(or I could dance around it)
It would feel good to scream
(I should quiet down)
I could be recognized
(or I could stay in bed)
Look the world in the eyes
(or just hang my head)

I'm holding steady this crooked crown
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down

When my ship has come in
(when it runs aground)
I'll be smiling again
(turn those corners down)
I've got something to say
(no one's listening)
It's my reckoning day
(so where's the reckoning?)

I'm holding steady this crooked crown
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down
I'm holding steady this crooked crown

My prodigy and my idiot play
For the prize of my delicate line
Somehow the score at the end of
The day is still 51-49

I'm holding steady this crooked crown
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down
I'm holding steady this crooked crown

// Unnecessarily Mercenary //

You're just into looking after #1
Only thing you worry 'bout is having your fun
First sign of trouble and it's understood
You'll get going while the going's still good
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a secret agent got a hidden agenda
Got me in your sights, think I'm a real big spender
Stick around baby pretty soon you'll see
I ain't got no money but my love's for free
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

You're a gun for hire when a war breaks out
Loving on the front line 'til the money runs out
Finger on the trigger, baby pull it and see
If your mercenary tactic's gonna work on me

You're a gun for hire when a war breaks out
Loving on the front line 'til the money runs out
Your finger's on the trigger, baby pull it and see
If your mercenary tactic's gonna work on me

You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
So very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary
You're so very unnecessarily mercenary

// I Don't Want Anything To Change //

Sleepless nights aren't so bad
I'm staying up, I'm staying sad
I don't want anything to change
I don't want anything to change
I like it lonely I like it strange
I don't want anything to change

You left a mess you're everywhere
I'd pick it up but I don't dare
I don't want anything to change
I don't want anything to change
There's nothing I would rearrange
I don't want anything to change

I can feel you fading
But until you're gone
I'm taking all the time I can borrow
The getting over is waiting
But I won't move on
And I'm gonna wanna feel the same tomorrow

I know the truth is right outside
But for the moment it's best denied
I don't want anything to change

I can feel you fading
But until you're gone
I'm taking all the time I can borrow
The getting over is waiting
But I won't move on
And I'm gonna wanna feel the same tomorrow

And I don't want anything to do
With what comes after you
I don't want anything to change
I don't want anything to change
I don't want anything to change

// Deep Water //

There are angels singing low inside my head
Cool tango blue and samba red
I want to scratch your name upon my wall
Cause I'm drowning here beneath love's waterfall

Deep water
Deep water

Baby you're love's got a hold on me
You row my boat right out to the sea
See the woman inside the girl
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world

We are walking like the waves beside the sea
There are oceans in my eyes that you can't see
And my arms reach out for you into the dark
I feel your skin where my nails left their mark

Deep water
Deep water

Baby you're love's got a hold on me
You row my boat right out to the sea
See the woman inside the girl
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world

Souls alike
Hands alike

Baby you're love's got a hold on me
You row my boat right out to the sea
See the woman inside the girl
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world

Baby you're love's got a hold on me
You row my boat right out to the sea
See the woman inside the girl
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world

Souls alike
Hands alike

// Two Lights In The Nighttime //

No river can hold you darlin'
No covers can hide you tying your shoes
My cupboards are overflowing
The wine is sublime I'm flyin' too

So slide on over and forget it's wrong
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Come on over and pick up your song it's new
And darlin' so are you
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do
No no no

My government owns the bible
My government owns the title too
The car that I got this mornin'
The car that I got for me and you

So what's comin' on down that road
It's two lights in the nighttime baby
You know that I'm gonna wanna
Share my load with you
And boy you know it's true
We'll stay together 'til the end of time
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do
No no no

So slide on over and forget it's wrong
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Come on over and pick up your song it's new
And darlin' so are you
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do
No no no

So what's comin' on down that road
It's two lights in the nighttime baby
You know that I'm gonna wanna
Share my load with you
And boy you know it's true
We'll stay together 'til the end of time
We're two lights in the nighttime baby
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do
Honey you know it's true

// The Bed I Made //

All the ways I cared for you
Are working like you want them to
As I break down and you stay strong
I write my own forgiveness song

I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
But it's not your concern
Another night and it's only right
I toss and I turn in the bed I made

The wine dark room the flashing eyes
That hung me from my string of lies
You said you were numb from wondering
I guess I wasn't listening

I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
But you're not concerned
Another night and it's only right
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made

With my own hands
I fashioned this frame
And into the wood
I carved out my name

I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
But you're not concerned
Another night and it's only right
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made

And it's only right
That I toss and I turn
In the bed I made

The bed I made
The bed I made
