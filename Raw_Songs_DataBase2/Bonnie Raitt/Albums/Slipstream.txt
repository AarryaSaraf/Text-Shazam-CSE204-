// Used To Rule The World //

Doctor Feelgood 
Sleepin' on a concrete bench
Can I get a witness?
Miss South Carolina 1975, 
Somebody stole your crown.
You were sleeping 
In your happy home, 
When you woke up baby,
Your life had come and gone. 
Now you're mystified, 
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world.

Brother Lovejoy 
Rappin' up a blue streak
Can I get a witness?
Miss Hurricane can't 
Keep your hands still 
Long enough to count your change.
You were wrapped up 
In your daily grind, 
The cost of living
It didn't even cross your mind. 
Now you're mystified, 
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world.

Mr. Blueprint 
Used to have it figured out
Now you can't find your car.
Miss Cocktaill dress 
Standing at the bathroom sink 
Looking for a back way out.
You can't believe your very eyes. 
Everything that you were counting on 
Was nothing but a pack of lies.
Now you're mystified, 
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule the world. 

Now you're mystified, 
Standing with the rest of us
Who used to rule, used to rule, used to rule the world.

// Right Down The Line //

You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line

I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you woman right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of tellin' you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
That every day I'm lovin' you so much more
'Cause you believed in me through my darkest night
Put somethin' better inside of me
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you woman
Right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way of tellin' you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
Everything I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of tellin' you
That every day I'm lovin' you so much more

If I should doubt myself, if I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line

// Million Miles //

You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep askin' myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie - that's alright, mama, I told myself one too
I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standin' out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

I'm driftin' in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwin' all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder 'til it's just what it's all coming to
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talkin' to somebody but I just don't know who
Well, I've tried to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

Yes, the last thing you said before ya hit the street
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
I said, "That's all right, mamma, you, you do what you gotta do"
Well, I've tried to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.

Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months
And I'll rock you too
I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

Well, there's voices in the night tryin' to be heard
I'm sittin' here listening to every mind-pollutin' word
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two
Yes, I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you.

// You Can't Fail Me Now //

I know that fan is moving air, I can see it in your hair
But I can't bear to breathe it in somehow
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now

Salt is sweet upon my mouth
And dark throws sparks against my house
The state of love is a smudge upon my brow
But you see through me and you can't fail me now
You see right through me, you can't fail me now

I've bit off more than I can chew
It's something that I tend to do
When fewer words are what we need and how
You bite my tongue and you can't fail me now
I rant and rail but you can't fail me now

I've lost the thread among the vines
And hung myself in storylines
That tell the tales I never would allow
God knows the name of every bird
That fills my mind like angry words
But you know all my secret heart avows

We're taught to love the worst of us
And mercy more than life but trust me
Mercy's just a warning shot across the bow
I live for yours and you can't fail me now
I live for your mercy, you can't fail me now
You can't fail me now

// Down To You //

Come around cryin' that you just can't win.
You thought this one was different, now it's gone again.
You just can't believe, baby.
"Why's it happenin' to me? "
Now...

You step out on the track in the pouring rain,
And when you get run over, well, you blame the train?
You just can't deny, baby,
Life is passing you by, baby.

Don't you think that you've had enough?
Ain't it time to get a different view?
Can't just wait around for what you want.
It's all about the way you choose.
Ain't nobody else that can make things right.
Baby, it's down to you.

Everywhere you look they're trying' to do you in.
You just can't understand, they used to be your friends.
It's always the same, baby.
Someone else is to blame, baby.

Still ain't got a clue the way it all goes down
'Cause what you're dishing out is coming back around.
Same old song, baby.
Gone all too long now

Don't'cha think that you've had enough?
Ain't it time to get a different view.
You can't just wait around for what you want.
It's all about the way you choose.
Ain't nobody else that can make things right.
Baby, it's down to you.

Down to you...

Don't'cha think that you've had enough?
Ain't it time to get a different view.
Can't just wait around for what you want.
It's all about the way you choose.
Ain't nobody else that can make things right.
Baby, it's down to you.

Down to you, honey...

// Take My Love With You //

Daylight, I think about you and wonder where you are
At night I'm wishing, looking at the stars,
But I don't worry 'bout you, I know that soon you'll be home.
But while you're gone

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do,
Take my love with you.

I'll be your talisman.
I'll be your lucky charm.
Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your heart.
Then in your weakness, baby, just let it help you along.
And make you strong

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.

And if the world around you begins to crumble and fall,
It wouldn't matter at all

Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do
Take my love with you.
Let it be the light that sees you through,
Chase away your blues.
Where you go and what you do,
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.
Take my love with you.

// Not Cause I Wanted To //

Well I'm calling you
'Cause you deserve to know
You were not the reason that I had to go,
Late at night in these hotel rooms
I think of all I've lost,
And what I put you through

And if I knew the reason
I would tell you why somehow
The feeling slipped away
I only did what I had to do
Not cause I wanted to.

I've got a guilty heart
And a troubled mind
No matter where I go
They're never far behind
I'd like to think
That you've forgiven me
But forgiveness ain't enough
To wash my conscience clean

Oh and if I knew the reason
I would tell you why somehow
The feeling slipped away
I only did what I had to do
Not cause I wanted to.
I only did what I had to do
Not cause I wanted to.

// Ain't Gonna Let You Go //

Love came and hit me
Straight on the lips
Nobody kisses
The better it gets, and baby that's all right
You got me standing beside myself
You know it ain't like me
It's like I'm somebody else
But baby that's all right

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go

I pled guilty, baby, of this terrible crime
You been lovin' me all of this time
And I must have been blind
What's gonna happen?
What'll I do?
Whatever it is, I wanna do it with you
I feel just fine

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you baby, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go

Ain't it peculiar how loves comes about?
When you're not lookin', you'd better look out!

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Feels so good
Now that I got you to myself
I'm gonna keep you for myself
Now that I got you
I don't wanna let you go

You're not the man I was looking for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you baby, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go
Now that I got you baby, I don't wanna let you go

// Marriage Made In Hollywood //

Jimmy's not a high concept guy
But he's front page news, let me tell you why
He's on the cover of the New York Post
Every network, coast to coast
All he needed was a hot night in June
'Cause he had the needle and he had the spoon
When he spiked it bit, and man, he flew
Into America's living room

[Chorus:]
We all love tragedy, it loves us too
It's a marriage made in Hollywood
Between greed and you
All you need to be a star is to die in open view
It's a marriage made in Hollywood
Between greed and you
Between greed and you
Between greed and you

Loved by women, admired by men
He walked down broadway with his best friend
His brain was wired like a light in a socket
With his old friend in his back pocket
That horse could kick, that horse could scream
Ride you out of here into a different scene
Unrequited love, and that makes it fair
But who keeps score when you're in mid-air?

[Chorus]

Like a free-fall chute that didn't open
He looked down to see his dream was broken
He stared back up at a hot grey sky
Re-ran his life and then he died
Well if you jump off a building, brother beware!
'Cause my friend Jimmy woke up mid-air
No time to smile, no time to wave
They buried him in a media grave

[Chorus]

// Split Decision //

It was more than just any old Friday night fight
With your mean left hook and my roundhouse right
We were both goin' for the heavyweight crown
TKO in the very first round

Thought you were gettin' the best of me
Floatin' like a butterfly, stingin' like a bee
Thought a good fight would get it out of our system
But we walked away with a split decision

Well, when we first met, you were a real knockout
I was head over heels, I was down for the count
But gettin' along got harder and harder
'Til we were nothin' more than sparrin' partners

I did my best to roll with the punches
You wore me out with fakin' and a-duckin'
Almost put me outta comission
But we walked away with a split decision

Split decision
Split decision
Everbody losin' and nobody winnin'
Just too tough, I had enough
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love
We took a split decision

I did my best to roll with the punches
You wore me out with fakin' and a-duckin'
Almost put me outta comission
But we walked away with a split decision

Split decision
Split decision
Everbody losin' and nobody winnin'
Just too tough, I had enough
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love

Split decision
Split decision
Everbody losin' and nobody winnin'
Just too tough, I had enough
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love
We took a split decision

// Standing In The Doorway //

I'm walkin' through the summer nights
Jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
Today it's moving too slow.

I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you
If I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
I got nothing to go back to now.

Maybe they'll get me, and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things that I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near.

I've been riding the midnight train
I've got ice water in my veins.

I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against any rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool.

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you're old no more
I can hear church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for?

Oh, I know I can't win
But my heart, it just won't give in.

I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation
There are no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head.

// God Only Knows //

Darkness settles on the ground
Leaves the day stumbling blind
Coming to a quiet close
And maybe just in time
We've almost lost the heart to know
How to keep our best in mind
We've almost lost the heart to know
How to keep our best in mind

Time has turned an angry face
Throws a dark eye back to sea
But what will pass for mercy now
We'll practice unforgivingly
As if might and will make right
Or either one could make us free
As if might and will make right
Or either one could make us free

Lovers laugh and cross this way
They're weaving out into the street
It seems we never were so young
Or it was never quite so sweet
But the world is always beautiful
When it's seen in full retreat
The worst of life looks beautiful
As it slips away in full retreat

God only knows that we can we do
No more or less than he'll allow
Well, God only knows that we mean well
God knows that we just don't know how
But I try to be your light in love
And pray that is enough for now
Well I try to be your light in love
And I'll pray that is enough for now
