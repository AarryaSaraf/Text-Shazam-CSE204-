Album: Fundamental

// The Fundamental Things //

Let's run naked through these city streets
We're all captives of captivity
Let's wear madness like a crucifix
Let's tattoo Bible quotes across both our hips

[Chorus:]
Let's get back to the fundamental things
Let's get back to the elements of style
Let's get back to simple skin on skin
Let's get back to the fundamental things

Let's dance barefoot over broken glass
Slither like a snake does through the wet, cold grass
Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind
Let's do the braindrain, leave it all behind

[Chorus]

You can sit in your room and worry
You can contemplate the end
Or let your house burn down behind you
Run bare-ass through the streets again

You can hide out on your rooftop
Wishing you had never been
Or go down to Hal's bar and grill
Find your innocence again

[Chorus]

// Cure For Love //

You bring me roses
You give me kisses
You bring me moons and stars
That shine so high up in the sky
My heart is beating wild and crazy
Hope that I can find
A cure for this love
Could be you want me
Could be you care
Could be the words you say,
Are things I just want to hear
You me nervous, got me shaking
Maybe I can find
A cure for this love
La la la la...

Doctor, doctor
Give me healing, so I can stop this feeling
It's getting so much stronger
And I just can't go on much longer
Doctor please
Find me a way out of love
When the phone rings
And no one answers
The letters comeback saying
Lover cannot be found
Don't go looking, don't bother searching
You see it's cuz your baby
Found herself a cure for love
La la la la...

// Round & Round //

There's a brand new dance
That just hit this town
Makes you feel so good
This dance they call the round and round

[Chorus:]
Round and round, up and down
Round and round, up and down

You know the kids got a bloodhound
Out on the playing ground
And when they want to have some fun
They start to goin round and round

[Chorus]

I got an elevator man
In the heart of town
And when he's feeling right
He will carry you round and round

[Chorus]

Baby don't be jealous
When I come to town
I'm just a country girl
Everybody's tryin to push poor me around

[Chorus]

// Spit Of Love //

There's a howlin at my window, baby
I hear him closin in
That green-eyed jackal's got the scent
Knows I'll let him in
He slinks in by me at the fire
More bitter than the cold
And it's a rage as old as hades
That'll sputter on these coals
I'm callin on the furies, to let the toast begin
I'm roasting on the spit of love again
I never have believed you
But I stick around for more
Somethin bout that hollow in your eyes
There's a darkness at the core
Well, it's got me slowly turnin
I'm basting on the bone
I'm skewered like some drunken fool
In juices all my own
Callin the furies' carrion choir
Singin me back upon the pyre
I'm roasting on that spit of love again
You can call it what you want
But it's lyin just the same
There's no mercy in these ashes, baby
When your love's a cryin shame
And they're howlin in moonlight, baby
They're here to call my bluff
They're wonderin if there'll ever come a day
When I'll have finally had enough
I'm callin on the furies, to let the toast begin
I'm roasting on that spit of love again

// Lover's Will //

Who'll take the only hearts they got
And throw them into the fire?
Who'll risk their own self respect
In the name of desire?
Who'll regret everything they've done
And who will get the bill?
Lovers will
Who'll hurt each other all the time
And never give it a thought?
Who'll lie about where they've been
And hope they never get caught?
Who'll say each other's kisses
No longer thrill?
Lovers will
Lovers will do almost anything
For the thrill that only love can bring
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?
Lovers will
Who'll never know what they've got
Until it's just about gone?
And whose arms will gather up what's left
To carry on?
And who'll stalk that little bit of love
That hasn't been killed?
Lovers will

// Blue For No Reason //

When I was a girl, my favorite thing
In the whole wide world
Was to see a field and
Run for no reason
And off I'd go, no one behind
Only earth below
Just a patch of green, green as the season

Don't ask why, your feet just fly
Green and sky is all that you're needin
Why ask why, when all that's true
The sky is blue, blue for no reason

Now that things have changed
Everything's carefully prearranged
Not a thing gets done
Except for a reason
Now I'm overrun, I'm startin to feel
Like a hired gun
Where's the chance, where's the fun
Where is the pleasin?

Try and try, you moan and sigh
You just can't find a thing to believe in
Why ask why, when all that's true
The sky is blue, blue for no reason

Don't ask why, your feet just fly
Green and sky is all that you're needin
Why ask why, when all that's true
You're just blue, blue for no reason

// Meet Me Half Way //

You come home late from work, baby
You wonder why it ain't on the table
After the day that I've had
I don't believe I'm able
You give me every little reason in the book
But there's one thing that I think you've overlooked
You say you're tired, well so am i
Baby you've got to try and
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby
Meet halfway if you want to get it right
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby
Meet halfway in the middle of the night
Our love is kind of stalled, baby
But it ain't about the sex
I'd trade the roses and the negligees
If we could just connect
I go deeper when you look into my eyes
There's a place where neither one of us can hide
And it's up to us to reinvent the game
Love it when you call my name and
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby
Meet halfway, and we're halfway home
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone

// I'm On Your Side //

Baby, won't you come and tell me
Tell me what we're gonna do...yeah, baby
I've tried everything I know just to,
Just to try and get along with you
Wake up in the morning and already
You are aimin for a fight
No matter what I say or do
I'm never gonna get it right

But ain't we gettin kind of tore down
Always layin it on the line
I don't think that when they called it love
This what they had in mind

[Chorus:]
(Hey) Baby, don't you know that
I'm on your side
All you got to do now, darlin...
Take my little heart and open wide
Hey baby, I know we can work it out
Might take a little mojo workin, baby
But ain't that what love is all about?

Hey, Baby, must be somethin bout this
push and pull
makes me wonder if we stir it up...
just to make sure things'll never get dull.

Come on baby take the gloves off
and then untie those shoes
I got something more tantalizin
For you left and right to do

[Chorus]

// Fearless Love //

Come my love
Come bravely to me
Let your heart be still
For our time
Has come my tender one
To be free of will

And fly
Blind on fearless love
Let them wild winds blow
We'll shine
On all we're fearful of
Then we'll let it go
Let it go

Skippin' stones
Across the great unknown
Safe at water's edge
Don't look down, baby
We're gonna leave this losin' town
And leap out from the ledge

And fly
Blind on fearless love
Let them wild winds blow
We'll shine
On all we're fearful of
Then we'll let it go
Let it go

// I Need Love //

I need love
And I search it everyplace I go
And lately I been in a zone
It's got a will of its own
But right now I'm here to discuss
Just what you think about us

I need love, I need love
And I'm checkin everything I see
You know at times I wanna take on three
That's just the way I could be
I let you know about that
Just so you know where I'm at
I need love, I need love

It's always been this way and ain't' nothin'
Gonna change it
And ain't nothing you can try

I need love, I need love
And I'm takin every chance I man
And baby you could make my day
There's just one thing I should say
Now that's it's all said and done
You know I do need to run
I need love, I need love

// One Belief Away //

Last night I thought I found you
I saw it in a dream
I was tangled in the rushes, baby
You were caught up in the stream
And the more I tried to reach you
The more you slipped away
And when I woke up in the darkness
I was callin' out your name

[Chorus:]
You and I we dance around it
Why is the truth so hard to say
We long for true love, well
We've found it, it's just
One belief away

There's a shadow in the garden
And it's coiled around our hearts
Won't you help me to believe you, baby
Won't you show me where to start

The more I try to reach you
The more you slip away
I want to wake up in the darkness
And hear you callin' out my name

[Chorus]
