Album: JustLikeThat

// Made Up Mind //

It starts out slow
With go ahead and go
Pretty soon the melody is like a rainstorm tin roof symphony
But it starts out slow

It goes on and on
For way too long
It always ends on a bad note
If you could dance at all, you'd dance alone
It goes on and on

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

There ain't no rhyme
Just wasted time
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong
There ain't no rhyme

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

The quiet behind a slamming door
The break of a heart that won't break no more
Get-away wheels in a straight line
Serenade of a made up mind

Of a made up mind
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong
Moonlight spotlight shining down on a made up mind and a love gone wrong

// Something's Got A Hold Of My Heart //

I'm stuck, stuck in the middle
Feel the quicksand pulling me down
Lovestruck, don't mean a little
Head keeps spinnin' round and round

Ain't natural, I'm walkin' sideways
Love potion goin' to my brain
Lights out, when you came my way
Feels good when you're going insane

And I don't feel like a fool
But I feel intoxicated
Never knew it could feel this good
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

No one, drive me crazy
Like the crazy you drive me
Blast off, planet Venus
Ain't no use to revive me

And I know just what I want to do
And when I want to do it
Never knew this could feel so bad
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Yes I truly do believe love is finally on the scene
Somethin's got a hold of my heart

And I don't feel like a fool
But I feel intoxicated
Never knew it could feel this good
Don't know why I waited
For the love of me

Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Somethin's got a hold of my heart
Yes I truly do believe love is finally on the scene
Somethin's got a hold of my heart

// Livin' For The Ones //

I can barely raise my head off the pillow
Some days I never get out of bed
I start out with the best of intentions
And then shuck it instead

I don't think we'll get back how we use to
No use in tryin' to measure the loss
We better start gettin' used to it
And damn the cost

Go ahead and ask me
How I make it through
Only way I know is

Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones

I'm livin' for the ones who didn't make it
Cut down through no fault of their own
Just keep 'em in mind, all the chances denied
If you ever start to bitch and moan

Just remember the ones who won't ever
Feel the sun on their faces again
Watch their grandkids collide, let it break you inside
Maybe this'll be the way you mend

Go ahead and ask me
How I make it through
Only way I know is

Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Keep livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)
Livin' for the ones (Ones who didn't make it)

// Just Like That //

I watched him circle 'round the block
Finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked
Like all he had was time
Excuse me, ma'am, maybe you can help
The directions weren't so clear
I'm looking for Olivia Zand
They said I might find her here

Well I looked real hard and asked him
What she's got he's looking for?

Said there's somethin' I think she'd want to know
And I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick
Caught me by surprise
But somethin' about him gave me ease
Right there in his eyes

And just like that your life can change
If I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now
He'd be 25 today
No knife can carve away the stain
No drink can drown regret
They say Jesus brings you peace and grace
Well he ain't found me yet

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

He sat down and took a deeper breath
Then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost
How you left without a trace
I've spent years just trying to find you
So I could finally let you know
It was your son's heart that saved me
And a life you gave us both

And just like that your life can change
Look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest
And I was with my boy again
Well I spent so long in darkness
I never thought the night would end
But somehow grace has found me
And I had to let him in

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

// When We Say Goodnight //

Two years of dust swept in the corner
Two years of junk and magazines
A picture of a sunset that you drew me
Folded in a box of memory

Damn, that winter nearly killed us
Cooped up every night and day
But we have this thing in common
Well, you know he likes it as much as me

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

Take down that picture from the wall
A blank canvas before our eyes
We don't need those things no more
Another day, a new sunrise

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

Release myself from earthly things
Well it's foolish, but it bears my name
It's grown to become part of me
We'll leave them behind just the same

I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

But I don't mind
One tear, one sigh
But keep me in your thoughts when we say goodnight

// Waitin' For You To Blow //

I keep her anger cocked and ready
Tucked in her stylin' holster
Draw the line in pretty colors
Just to dare some fool to cross her
I keep her righteousness on simmer
Though it's tastier on a boil
And her tongue stays nice'n sharp
The tighter she stays coiled

I love to let her lay around
Blowin' deadlines once again
Stock her up with lame excuses
For things she meant to send
I make her blow her diet
Till she slips to full-on binge
Then I up her shame about it
'Cause she looks so cute unhinged

I got her where she is today
But do I get respect?
She claims she's so above it now
She keeps all that mess in check
Recovery's a fickle beast
You better stick to what you know
And I'm always ridin' shotgun, baby
Just waitin' for you to you blow

Don't matter how much time you got
It's still a slippery ledge
You gotta keep an eye on every step
When there's no more bets to hedge
You can whine and boast, cut 'n run
And fall down on your knees
But if it ain't the full surrender, baby
It's all the same to me

It's funny how a little doubt'll muddle up her way
It only takes some darker thoughts to wreck her sunny day
I let her draw love close enough to see she really cares
But no way do they get inside in case there's no one there

No one there

I got her where she is today
But do I get respect?
She claims she's so above it now
She keeps all that mess in check
Recovery's a fickle beast
You better stick to what you know
'Cause I'm always ridin' shotgun, baby
Just waitin' for you to you blow

Da, na na na
Waitin' for you, baby
Waitin' for you to blow

// Blame It On Me //

Blame it on me
Hold up my faults for all to see
Truth is love's first casualty
Blame it on me

Blame it on me
It's not the way love is supposed to be
How can you so casually
Blame it on me

Blame it on stars
Shining like headlights from a million cars
Strung like jewels from here to Mars
Blame it on stars

Blame it on time
The fugitive, the vagabond, it's the perfect crime
Poured like sand through your hands and mine
Blame it on time

How can you talk that way?
Just turn around and walk away
Your words, they sting so heartlessly
So go ahead, be free, blame it all on me

But one summer night
When my door is open and the moon is new
And some sad melody comes stealing through
And my heart should break in two

If my heart should break in two
Oh baby, ooh
Oh baby, I'm gonna blame it on you
Blame it on you

I'll blame it on you, baby

// Love So Strong //

Every day you say
That you wish that I could go with you
Every night you keep on telling me
That you wish that I could follow you
Every time you keep on worrying me, yeah
You wish that I could go with you
But it's a good thing I didn't follow you
Do those funny things that you wanted me to do
You tried to bend my love, yeah
And you made a fool out of me

One time I know is not the same
When we used to play in the sun
We used to hold each other's hand
Remember, we'd play in the pond?
So all the good looks you have would not break my heart
My own heart still remains the same
Honey, you tried to bend my love
Make a big old fool out of me

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a look at my face
You will see that my future's still bright
Oh, bright as the sun in the sky, now honey
You're sure to see me shine
Shine as the stars in the morning
That brighten up the sky

Said my love is so strong (Said my love is so strong)
And my mind unchangeable (My mind's unchangeable)
You take a good look at my face (Take a look at my face)
You will see that my future is still bright (See that my future's still bright)

(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
Bright as the stars in the sky now, honey
(Treat her like the way you really should)
You're sure to see me shine
(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
Shine as the morning stars
(Treat her like the way you really should)
That brighten in the sky

Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good
(Treat her like the way you really should)
Treat her the way that you should
Ooooh, see me shine
(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
(Treat her like the way you really should)

// Here Comes Love //

Whoa... oh...
Yeah, yeah baby

In the beginning it was just for fun
Now you got me runnin' from sun to sun
Well the funny thing, baby is that I don't mind
You know a real good thing sure is hard to find

That's why I'm singing a song
Ooh yeah, yeah
Oh no, no
Oh my, my
Here comes love again

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh no, no
Ooh my, my
Here comes love again

So you thought you left the game
But you're fallin' just the same
Well, some things don't ever change
Here comes love again

Chicken and dumplings that's all it's gonna take
Just to make you stay for the ice cream cake
You think you don't want sugar, baby, in your tea
Hmm honey, but the right kind of sugar, yeah, yeah, we'll see

That's why I'm singing a song
Oh yeah, yeah
Whoa, oh no, no
My, my here comes love again
Ooh (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Oh no, no)
(Oh my, my)

You're all out of tokens, think you're out of the game
But a kind soul'll come around and buy you right back in
Ooh, you wanna jump off the train and stay a while in town
But don't you know long as the world keeps turnin'
Love is comin' 'round
It's comin' around

// Down The Hall //

I had the flu in the prison infirmary
My last day I looked up and saw
A man wheeled round the corner
Down to skin and bones, that's all

I asked the nurse where he was goin'
She said, "Hospice down the hall
He probably won't be in there long
Any day we'll get the call"

I asked if they let family in
She said, "Not really at the end
Truth is, a lot don't have someone
No friends or next of kin"

The thought of those guys goin' out alone
It hit me somewhere deep
I asked, could I go sit with 'em
For some comfort and relief?

Next thing you know, I'm on the ward
Doin' things you can't believe
Like shavin' Julio's bony head
Crackin' him up when I wash his feet

Oh well, I used to run when I saw Tyrone
Knowin' your place's what it's all about
And now he's here doubled up in pain
Cancer eatin' him from the inside out

I sit and wait outside his stall
To help him when he's done
Whatever shame we might have felt
Well, all that's come undone

Well, I can't undo the wrong I did
Give back the life I took
But maybe when it comes my turn
I'll get a second look

I don't know 'bout religion
Only know what I see
And in the end when I hold their hand
It's both of us set free
