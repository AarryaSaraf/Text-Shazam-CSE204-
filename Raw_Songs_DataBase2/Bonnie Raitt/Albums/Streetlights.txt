// That Song About The Midway //

Met you on a midaway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses
You were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like the devil wearing wings
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?
Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky

I followed through a sideshow to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?

Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine
But I feel like I've been working overtime
Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime
And I envy you the valley that you've found

'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down

// Rainy Day Man //

What good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry

Well it looks like another fall
My friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man

And it does me no good to pretend
When he's made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like I lose again my friend
Guess I'll have to look up my rainy day man

Rainy day man 
He don't like sunshine
Don't chase rainbows 
He don't need good times
Grey days roll in 
And then you'll see him
It's an empty feelin'
Now I need him

All those noble thoughts they don't belong
If you can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since I knew where I stood all along
Think I'll look up my rainy day man

Simple pleasures all evade you
And the store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
I said, ask again
Why don't you pray for rain

Oh, it looks like another fall
And my friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man
All I have to do is look at my baby
Look up my rainy day man
Oooo, look up my rainy day man
All I have to do
Is look up my rainy day man...

// Angel From Montgomery //

I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old

If dreams were thunder
And lightning was desire
This old house woulda burnt down
A long time ago

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl
Well I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I tried
Those years just flow by
Like a broken down dam

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear them there buzzin'
And I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today
But how the hell can a person
Go to work in the mornin'
And come home in the evenin'
And have nothin' to say

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

// I Got Plenty //

Did you get enough today
Did you give out any
Had a lots of things to do
Maybe just too many
Any now the world is you
Taken all the dreams you knew
Come to me, I got plenty

Did you feel alone today
with your one and only
I had a lot of things to say
People make you lonely
You wonder what you're living on
You left with all your reasons gone
Count on me, I got plenty

You can count on me, I got plenty
Count on me

Got an invitation now
To come and join the party
Come in your individual,
Not your everybody
And don't worry that you won't you will
You've got an empty cup to fill

Count on me x2
Coz I got plenty

I got plenty to end

// Streetlights //

I heard a voice come through on my telephone line
Told me that it was your time
I thought that they were fooling
They were fooling me
And then I remember having this dream of mine
When it came down on me

I was told by a friend of mine
That it don't matter if your dreams, they bother you
Your dreams won't happen unless you only want them to
So I asked him for a ride
He said, "Hop on board, girl
I been waitin' here for you"
I thought I had nothin' left to lose

Where'd you say you'd be tonight
Streetlights are all I see

All I wanted on that ride
Was just a little kindness, a little kindness shown my way
I found myself runnin' out of ideas on how to say
It just got to be somethin' more than I could take
But that summer somehow we were havin' fun
Your magic took me by surprise

Where'd you say you'd be tonight
Streetlights are all I see
And now I know the feelin's right
Yes I know the feelin's right
'Cause just last night you came into my dreams

Yes you did, yes you did

I heard a voice come through on my telephone line
Told me that it was your time
I thought that they were fooling
They were fooling me
And then I remember having this dream of mine
When it came down on me
I said it came down on meâ€”Oh

Where'd you say you'd be tonight
Streetlights are all I see

And now I know the feelin's right
'Cause just last night you came into my dreams

I heard a voice come through on my telephone line
Told me that it was your time

// What Is Success //

How does one decide
That the methods he's using,
They just don't jive
To truly believe and keep trying
Over and over again
Living in hopes,
That someday you'll be in with the winners

When will one change his mind
And jump the fence
For the dial a sign
Its a sad thing, its a bad thing
But so necessary
Living in hopes,
That someday you'll be in with the winners

Now what, what, (I don't know, can you tell me what)
What is success?
Is it do your own thing?
Or to join the rest
And if you truly believe it,
And try over and over again
Living in hopes
That someday you'll be in with the winners

Oooh, tell me what it is
Sweet success

Oooh, tell me what it is
Sweet success

// Ain't Nobody Home //

Once upon a time, a long long time ago,
wherever you would lead me, I would surely follow
Boy, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing at my doorstep,
Telling me how much you need me

Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home,
But you laughed at me and said to let you alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you,
But this time, baby, it's your turn to pay

Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

Boy, I used to love you,
I placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I owned
But baby you can't come back here
'cause there ain't nobody home

Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way
How I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
But time has made some changes, and turned me upside down
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you,
But this time, baby, you can turn right around

'Cause there ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

// Everything That Touches You //

You say you're all alone
With visions all your own
The things you feel nobody feels the same
But you know me
You know what I've been through

And everything that touches me
And everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Touches you

Friends along the road
May lighten up your load
By sayin' what they think you really want to hear
But I'll only tell you
What I feel is true

And everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
And everything that touches me
Touches you

Share, 'cause I can't take you there
Unless I know a part of what you're thinking
Care, 'cause it's only fair
Darlin' can't you feel my heart is breaking
My heart is breaking

Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Everything that touches me
Touches you...

// Got You On My Mind //

I saw you this mornin'
Though you were nowhere in sight
But I've got to admit
That the thought of you hangs around me
Like a hand on my shoulder, like a fly on my nose

I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind

Well I tried to catch the moon in a butterfly net
But I tripped and it slipped from my hand
And it fell into the sea
But at least I know where the moon is hiding
And just like the moon

I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind

Now some nights I'll be sitting at home
Starin' at some old magazines
And I wonder could somebody tell me
Whatever happened to those back seat plans
Did they drive off with the man?

I tell you, a girl stays single 'cause she don't like men
Or maybe she likes them too much
Me, I like them not too much or too little
But times were easy and so was I
Was I in love with you or just in love with love...?

I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind

[Instrumental break]

Got you on my mind 
I got you on my mind

There were days when I was feelin' so low
Brought us close as no good times could
There were moments so full of understanding
And I couldn't bear to see them end
Ooo, I'd like to be in love again

I got you on my mind 
I got you on my mind
Said, I gotchu, can't seem to get you off my mind
I got you on my mind
Just like a hand on my shoulder, like a fly on my nose
I got you on my mind...

// You Got To Be Ready For Love (If You Wanna Be Mine) //

You got to be ready
You got to be ready, yeah

This woman don't like no nonsense
I like lovin' every day
And I don't like to find no evidence, no
To proove you're giving my love away
What more can I say

Except you got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine (ready baby)
You got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine
You got to be ready
You got to be ready

This woman don't do no handpickin'
And I don't think one look is a fellony
And I don't appreciate no rubberneckin', no
'Bout a man, when he's with me
Out in the street

Except you got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)
I said you got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine
You got to be ready
You got to be ready

Ready for love
Ready for love
Got to be ready for love

You got to be ready
You got to be ready
You got to be ready
You got to be ready, yeah

You got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine
You got to be ready for love
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)

Can't be a cold lover
Just like my old lover
If you wanna be mine
You got to get ready
You got to stay ready
If you wanna be mine (be ready baby)
