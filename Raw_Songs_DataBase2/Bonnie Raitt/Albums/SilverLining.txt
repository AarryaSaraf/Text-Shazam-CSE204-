// Fool's Game //

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Stopping thinking about what you want to do
Then taking a good look what's looking real good to you
I think we're hard about what it is you see
Is that really where you want to be

Look were hard alone
Seeing what's going on
It's a fool's game

Well, you're living rough, you're living on the street
When you're mind and your body and soul it ain't what you think
Well, you got a good parade energy use it if you can
You're gonna lie yourself to be a ragged on by the man

But there's a lot of jungle
There's a lot of land, to get caught in the middle
To try to make the best you can

It's a fool's game
It's a damn fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a damn fool's game

But there's a lot of jungle
There's a lot of land, to get caught in the middle
To try to make the best you can

It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game

It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game
It's a fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game
Bad mistake is a crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

Bad mistake, crying shame
Get on playing that damn fool's game

// I Can't Help You Now //

Where were you when I was fallin down
Buzzin round your heart
Why'd you wait till I was moving on
To come out of the dark

To say I'm what you need
And you could spend your life with me

[Chorus:]
Well I can't help you now
(Sorry baby, I can't help you)
No, I can't help you now
(Keep away, I've fallen in love)
Maybe there was a time
But sometimes time runs out
And I can't help you know

Forty days since I stopped countin' the days
And countin' the ways that I loved you
Good long while since I found
Good enough reasons to stop believin' that you
Are what I really want
And now that you you do baby, I don't

[Chorus]

Now you say I'm the one you need
And you could spend your life with me
But I can't help you know,no

I can't help you know

Baby there was a time
And I wish I could somehow
But I can't help you
Can't help you know

// Silver Lining //

Take this silver lining
Keep it in your own
Sweet head
And shine it when the night is
Burning red
Shine it in the twilight
Shine it on the cold, cold ground
Shine it till these walls
Come tumbling down

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkest deep
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

Step into the silence
Take it in your own
Two hands
And sprinkle it like diamonds
All across these lands
Blaze it in the morning
Wear it like an iron skin
Only things worth living for are
Innocence and magic, amen

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkest deep
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

Woah, wooah

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the talk so cheap
Fools and their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleep

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleep

// Time Of Our Lives //

Who'll take the only hearts they got
And throw them into the fire?
Who'll risk their own self respect
In the name of desire?
Who'll regret everything they've done
And who will get the bill?
Lovers will
Who'll hurt each other all the time
And never give it a thought?
Who'll lie about where they've been
And hope they never get caught?
Who'll say each other's kisses
No longer thrill?
Lovers will
Lovers will do almost anything
For the thrill that only love can bring
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?
Lovers will
Who'll never know what they've got
Until it's just about gone?
And whose arms will gather up what's left
To carry on?
And who'll stalk that little bit of love
That hasn't been killed?
Lovers will

// Gnawin' On It //

I'm down here workin' at my job
But I just can't concentrate
You keep messin' with my mind
Yeah, I'm circlin' round the bait
I got to take off early
I got to get you home
Gonna show you little woman why a dog loves a bone

We'll be gnawin' on it
Yeah, gnawin' on it
We be gnawin' on it
Ah, nah, baby don't do that

I dropped the kids at school this morning
Hung the clothes in the back
I'm trying to take care of my business
Nut my mind ain't on the track
You got me feeling kind of squirrelly
I got to get you in this place,
'Cause what I got in mind'll put a grin on your face.

We'll be gnawin' on it
Yeah, gnawin' on it
We be gnawin' on it
Ah, nah, baby don't do that

They say it's hard to keep it going
When you're together for so long
They say combustion's for the youngsters
We should be glad we get along
But they don't know nothin' 'bout it
They way you love me it's a shame
'Cause there ain't nobody better
Blowin' embers to a flame

We'll be gnawin' on it
Yeah, gnawin' on it
We be gnawin' on it
Ah, nah, baby don't do that

// Monkey Business //

Someone's up to monkey business
Someone just ain't acting right
Someone's up to monkey business
Playing monkey wi'cho mind

Monkey men in monkey boots
Dressed up in their monkey boots
Plenty monkey up a tree
Ain't no mug gohn monkey me

Someone's up to monkey business
Someone's out there doing the do
Someone's up to monkey business
Is that monkey you, you, you?

Monkey see, monkey do
Makin' monkey outta you
Monkey do, monkey see
Can't make a monkey outta me

Monkey see, monkey do
Makin' monkey outta you
Monkey do, monkey see
Can't make a monkey outta me

Someone's up to monkey business
Don't let them make a monkey outta you

// Wherever You May Be //

As simple as breathing
I picture your face,
All tangled in daydreams
And shielded with grace.

I feel you beside me.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart
Only for you.

If I must do without
I'll let these sparks fly out
Across the wilderness
From me to you.

As certain as sunrise
Your image unwinds.
You're clearer than crystal.
You fill up my mind.

Now I have you by my side.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart
Only for you.

Though Continents devide,
And lonely thoughts collide
Our heaven will allow no distance now.

I can always close my eyes
Take your absence by surprise,
Hold my breath and make believe.

As simple as breathing
I picture your face,
All tangled in daydreams
And sheilded with grace.

There's somewhere in my heart only for you.

If I must do without
I'll let these sparks fly out
Across this wilderness
From me to you.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart only for you.

// Valley Of Pain //

Ah... don't let me grow bitter I pray
Give me strength to carry on my way

I'm leanin on you like a wooden cane
Well, I'm walkin through; I'm walkin through the valley of the pain

I'm believin there's a reason for this trial'
This too shall pass in a little while
Woh, Lord have mercy if I complain
I'm  walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain
Yes, I'm  walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain

Paint me in a river of my tears
Whisper hope and truth - courage in my ears

Well, when I'm hurtin I have a dangerous tongue
I lose it and use it like a gun
Oh wont you stop me if you see me takin aim
I'm  walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain
If I'm walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain
Yes, I'm walkin through; I'm walkin through the valley of the pain

Paint me in a river of my tears
Whisper hope and truth - courage in my ears
Remind me when I reach the other side
I'll b thankful for every tear that I cries

Don't let the darkness drive me insane
I'm  walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain
If I'm walkin through, I'm walkin through the valley of the pain
Yes, I'm walkin through; I'm walkin through the valley of the pain

// Hear Me Lord //

Hear me Lord 
Hear me I pray 
Help me now, help me Lord 
Help me Lord I'm feeling low 
Help me now, help me Lord 
Help me Lord I'm feeling low 

I'm feeling low, I'm feeling low 
Help me Lord, I'm feeling low 
I'm feeling low, I'm feeling low 
Help me Lord, I'm feeling low 

Help me Lord, I'm feeling low 
Have mercy, have mercy on me 
Help me Lord, Help me I pray

// No Gettin' Over You //

Well I went and gave away my TV
Told the man "cut off the phone"
I put an ad in the paper, baby,
Gonna sell everything I own
Done everything in the world I know
To try to make it through
There's just no getting over you

Well I went and bought myself a new straw hat
One eye pokin' under the brim
Bought myself a little seaside shack
In case I might just want to swim
Done everything I know in the world I know
To try to shake these blues but
There's just no getting over you

Well I try and try
But honey it ain't no use
Cry and cry
I just can't turn you loose
Why oh why
Can't I get you off my mind
You got that hook so far in
I gotta get you off my line

Well I got some transcendental meditation
And I'm taking up Japanese
I signed up at the cooking school
I'm going to pick up on some hard cuisine
Done everything in the world
Just to try to make it through
There's just no getting over you

Well I try and try
But honey it ain't no use
Cry and cry
Just can't turn you loose
Why oh why
Can't I get you off my mind
You got that hook so far in
I just got to get you off my line

Now listen to this one time
You know the way you do, honey

Well I just can't make it over
Can't seem to make it baby
No matter what I say or do baby
I can't make it over
Oooh
Well there's just no getting over you

// Back Around //

Turning into something 
Drifting off to old ways 
Got to pull myself back in 

Holding back the questions 
We're bruised with all rejection 
Gotta pull myself back in 

[Chorus:] 
Suffer the breaks 
You know I still remember it 
It keeps burning away 
I know that you may take a while 
To come back around 

Come back around 
I miss you around 

Reaching out for someone 
Burning out for so long 
Got to pull myself back in 
There's no new religion 
And there's no real solution 
Gotta pull myself back in 

[Chorus 2x] 

Come back around 
Come back around 

Feel you're going under 
So keep on treading water 
Got to pull myself back in 
Feel no obligation 
But no more indecision 
Gotta pull myself back in

// Wounded Heart //

Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself
Though I wanted to be brave, it never helped.
'Cause your trouble's like a flood raging through your veins
No amount of love's enough to end the pain

Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong,
But the anger that you feel goes on and on.
And it's not enough to know that I love you still
So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill

[Instrumental break]

If you listen you can hear the angel's wings
Up above our heads so near they are hovering
Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.

When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.
