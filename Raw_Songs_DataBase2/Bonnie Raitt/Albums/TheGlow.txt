// I Thank You //

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did
Yes you did
And I thank you

You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did
Yes you did
And I thank you

If you took your love somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You make me feel, Like I've never felt
Kisses so good I've got to holler for help
You didn't have to shake it like you did
But you did
Yes you did
And I thank you

You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did
Yes you did
And I thank you

All my life I've been short changed
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
Now I know what the girls were talking about
When they say that ya.....oooooooooooooh
I wanna thank you baby
Thank you honey
I've got to thank you Oooooh hoooooo
Baby yeaahhhh

// Your Good Thing (Is About To End) //

I don't have to beg you to hold me
'Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it, no
'Cause somebody else will

Some kind friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're tryin' to get it
Look out, your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about to come to an end

All those nights I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch 'em all alone
When other men said they wanted me, baby
I didn't have to tell them I was 
Your very own

You have all the love that I've got
Even ice melts to water and gets hot
Look out, your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
It's about to end

[Saxophone break]

Gettin' myself back together
Is gonna be a be problem I know
But when the right man says he wants me
Boy, you can bet I won't tell him no
'Cause your real good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real, your good thing
Your good thing baby
Your good thing
Your good thing
Your good thing baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Standin' By The Same Old Love //

I told you before
You know it may take a little while
I'd like to go there with you but
Runnin' just ain't my style
You want me to stay, well
You got to take it nice and slow
I'll show you the way
Just tell me if you want to know

I remember the time 
When we thought we'd never get enough
Tryin' to make a new love
And makin' it all at once
We wonder how we keep it up
After all these years
You worry 'bout your end, baby
I'll bring up the rear

I love you baby 
Don't you put me up against the wall
I ain't gonna jump every time
You need an overhaul
Maybe it'll take all night
But we'll do it 'til we get it right
And we'll be standin' by the same old love
That made us fall

There's a lot more to love
Than seein' how much love we can make
There's the kindness that makes it
So sweet 'til your little heart could break
And I want you to know
That I'm not just along for the ride
And I won't settle for less than
Everything I've got inside

I love you baby 
Don't you put me up against the wall
I ain't gonna jump every time
You need an overhaul
Maybe it'll take all night
But we'll do it 'til we get it right
And we'll be standin' by the same,
Standin' by the same
Well, we'll be standin' by the same old
Oughta be standin' by the same old love
Oooo, standin'
Standin'

[Starts to fade...]

Why aren't ya standin'?
Oughta be standin'
Why aren't you just standin'?
Why aren't you just standin'?
Why aren't you just standin'?...

// Sleep's Dark And Silent Gate //

Sometimes I lie awake at night
And wonder
Where my life will lead me
Waiting to pass under
Sleep's dark and silent gate

I found my love today
Runnin' round day after day
Lookin' for the time to play
While my old friends
They slipped away

Never should've had to try so hard
To make a love work out, I guess
I don't know what love has got to do
With happiness

But the times when we were happy
Were the times we'd never tried

Sittin' down by the highway
I don't know where I been
I don't know where I'm going
Oh, God this is some kind of shape I'm in
When the only thing that makes me cry
Is the kindness in my baby's eyes

[Guitar break]

Sometimes I lie awake at night
And wonder
Where the years have gone
They have all passed under
Sleep's dark and silent gate
I've found my love today
I've found my love today
I've found my love today
Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't know where I been
(I found my love)
Oooooo, I found my love
I found my love today.

// The Glow //

I need a drink
Don't want to think
I drink too much
But who's to say
What's right or wrong?

I guess you think you see
You're tellin' me
That I don't know
When it's passed the point
Of feelin' good
I run around and find
I just can't get satisfied
Tonight

Now there's a phone
I hear the sound
I needed to talk
But it's too late
For talkin' now

I guess I'll go alone
I feel a glow...
Here i am
Here i am
Here i am
What I need is a friend tonight
What I need is a friend
What I need is someone
What I really deed is just one more drink
Tonight
Tonight...

// Bye Bye Baby //

Well, you took my heart
And you broke it apart
Why did a love, baby, yeah
Have to ever start?
You know you took my love
You threw it away
And you're gonna want
My love someday
Well, bye bye baby

Well, I thought your love
Was oh so true
And you made me, baby
Start lovin' you
And then you took my love
You threw it away
Well, you're gonna want
My love someday
So, bye bye baby

Well, your love was sweeter than
Any I know so
Don't come back runnin' or
Knockin' on my front door

Well, you said that I
Was your only girl
And that there was no other, yeah
In this whole wild world
Well, you took my love
You threw it away
Now you're gonna want
My love someday
Well, bye bye baby

// The Boy Can't Help It //

If he walks by and the women get engrosed
If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast
He's got a lot of what they call the most

You know the boy can't help it
He was born to please
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it

If he mezmerizes each and every one
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twentyone

You know the boy can't help it
He was born to please
And if i got to go down to him on bended knees
It's because I'm hoping, obviously
That some day his answer will be
The boy can't help it
He's in love with me.

// (I Could Have Been Your) Best Old Friend //

Fate is mighty cruel
Where true love is concerned
It seems you give out more
Than you ever have returned
Lately I have tried
To make it on my own
Another nite has passed
Looks like I'm bound to be alone
Bound to be alone

Now solitude is fine
When you really need it
When your soul is dry
Sometimes loneliness can feed it
When you need a lover
You know there's nothin' else will do
When you need love most
You know it turns it's back on you

Oh, I can make it thru without your company
I only wish I knew why you won't comfort me
I thot that I could count on you
To hear me cryin' out
I guess that's one comfort
I will learn to do without

Fallin love too easily
But never quite so fast
So you are not the first and, lord
You sure won't be the last
The thing about the situation
That makes me feel so sad
I could've been the best old friend
That you have ever had
I could've been the best old friend
That you have ever had

// You're Gonna Get What's Coming //

You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it
I've got a Thunderbird parked right outside
Give me a minute to finish this thing and we'll light it

In all this heat it's a job keepin' cool
And I could fry an egg on you

You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it

[Chorus:]
You're gonna get what's comin'
You been asking for it two days running
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's comin' to you

I hope that you're half as intrepid as you make out
Often or not, but you never got what you asked for
Keep on pouring until you hear me shout
And turn up the sound if you want me to drive any faster

Caution went out when you walked in the room
If it never came back it would be too soon.

[Chorus]

You came upon me like a landslide,
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it

[Chorus]

// (Goin') Wild For You Baby //

Struck by the moon, rising too soon
I feel a pain deep inside me
Cold nothern wind, a fist in my chin
Makin' me wild for you baby

What can I do to get back to you
I'm feelin' desperate and lonely
The city's a river of cold misery
Makin' me wild for you baby

I'm down on my knees
Hear me cry for you baby
Cold misery
I would die for you baby
I pray you will see
These tears I cry

Struck by the moon, rising too soon
I feel a pain deep inside me
Cold nothern wind, a fist in my chin
Makin' me wild for you baby

What can I do to get back to you
I'm feelin' desperate and lonely
The city's a river of cold misery
Makin' me wild for you baby

I'm down on my knees
Hear me cry for you baby
Cold misery
I would die for you baby
I pray you will see
These tears I cry
