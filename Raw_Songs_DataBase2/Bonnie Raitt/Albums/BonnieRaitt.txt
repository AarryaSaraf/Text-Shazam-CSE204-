// Bluebird //

Listen to my blue bird laugh she can tell you why,
Deep within her heart you see, she knows only right
Whoa-oo just light
There she sits this lofty bird the strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now she thinks only of you
Woo just you
So get all those blues, must be a thousand hues, and each is differently used
You just know, you sit there mezmerized by the deepth of her eyes
And if you categorize she got soul, she got soul, she got soul

Soon she's gon' to fly away, her sadness is her own
Leave beside her bath of tears, she'll go home

// Mighty Tight Woman //

I come to you, sweet man
And I'm, I'm fallin' on my knees
I come to you, pretty papa
Fallin' on my knees
Ask if you don't have nobody
Won't you kindly take me please

Cause I'm a mighty tight woman
I'm a real tight woman
Lord I'm a jack of all trades
I can be your sweet woman
Also be your slave
Lord I can do things so good
You will swear that I behave

I got all of them sayin'
That I'm tight in everything I do
I got all the men cryin'
I'm a broad that will never be blue
What I need is a good man
And I will make him happy too

If you're a married man
You ain't got no business here
Cause when you're out with me
I might make your wife shed a tear
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman
There is nothing, nothing that I fear

// Thank You //

Sittin' here thinkin' baby about you
I'm wonderin' how I ever got through my life without you
Days pass me by, left my life somewhere behind
Games I was tryin' out, oh before my time

You came into my life almost like you knew
That time was runnin' out, oh I came runnin' home to you
You taught me how to love you, you helped me too
You could even love me, I was all you'd ever need

[Instrumental break]

Sometimes when you're sleepin' I wonder if it's true
I'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream of you
Then you'll wake and hold me and love me through the night
Then I'll know that somehow everything will be alright

Thank you baby, for giving me my life
I love you honey. you've given me my life
Ooooooo 
Thank you baby, for giving me my life.

// Finest Lovin' Man //

The man I'm lovin'
Don't worry 'bout me runnin' around
You won't ever find my baby
Hustlin' after me all over town
He don't have to shout
He don't even have to call
Knows I'm comin' home
Even if I got to crawl
He'll get me when he wants me
He's the finest lovin' man around

When he gets up in the morning
Or when he comes home late at night
You know the man's always hungry
Knows I'm gonna cook it up just right
He don't ever hurry
He just takes his time
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine
He'll get it when he wants it
He's the finest lovin' man around

Some women they act just
Like their men will never come to no good
You know they are always on the cheat
And never treat him like a good woman should
You want him to do you right
Honey, that ain't the way
You got to love him all night
You do just what he say
And you get just what you give out
That's the only way to gain his faith

[Solo]

Now me and my baby
We always know just what we're puttin' down
And we know we'll be together
Til the day when something better comes around
Til that day comes
You won't hear me complaining
I'll take him as like he is
Cause you know I can't change him
I'll love him best I can
He's the finest lovin' man around

// Any Day Woman //

If you don't love her you'd better let her go
You'll never fool her you're bound to let it show
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake
Everything in return
You just preserve her
When you serve her a little tenderness.

If she's a woman she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here
Just the way a womans mind
Well she has no name, she has no shame
She just loves you

It's not easy to undo what's done
Or to speak too freely to just anyone
And if this takes more than you bargained for
Boy it's time you learned
Not to talk so loud, not to walk so proud
When you're comin' on.

// Big Road //

Well I ain't goin' down that big long lonesome road
Pretty baby don't you hear me talkin'
No I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
If I can't carrry you baby
I'm gonna get me someone else

Alright boys
Well the sun is gonna shine in my back door some
My back door some, my door someday
You know the sun is gonna shine in
My back door some day
That big wind is gonna come up and blow my blues away

Now if you don't want me baby
Now why don't you tell me
Now why don't you tell me, tell me so
If you don't want me baby why don't you tell me so
It ain't like I'm a woman who ain't got no place to go

Play it right now
Now what good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or
He won't fuss or fight pretty baby
What good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or fight.
And what good is a man can't make his wolf stay all night

// Danger Heartbreak Dead Ahead //

When you give more than you get
You're in danger
You may find that you're in love
With a stranger

But who knows what evil
Lurks within the hearts of men?
It's vanity, insanity
You play what you can't win

If you find that you're losing
Girl, it's time to get on moving
'Cause there's danger
Heartbreak dead ahead

Well, it only takes one second, girl, to learn
That playing with fire will get you burned
So girl, don't you be foolish

They say that love is blind
But it's clear as the highway sign
That reads 'Danger, heartbreak dead ahead'
Heartbreak dead ahead

Better mind, girl, read the sign, girl
Yeah, danger and heartbreak dead ahead

I want somebody's boy
(Heartbreak dead ahead)
Start packing up your heart
Now listen to me, girl

There's nothing to be gained
So don't keep going on in vain
There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead
Yeah, I said, "There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead"

Danger, I said, "There's danger"
(Heartbreak dead ahead)
I said, "There's danger and heartbreak dead ahead"
Baby, yeah, I said, "There's danger"
(Heartbreak dead ahead)

// Since I Fell For You //

When you just give love, and never get love,
You'd better let love depart.

I know it's so, and still I know,
I can't get you out of my heart.

You made me leave my happy home.
You took my love, and now you've gone,
Since I fell for you ...

My life has been such misery and pain.
I guess I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you ...

When you love me, and then you snub me.
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light.
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you...

When you love me, and then you snub me.
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light.
I get those blues most every night,
Since I fell for you ...

Since you loved me, then you snubbed me
I prayed you put no one above me
Now I'm black and blue since I fell for you

Since I fell for you, for you, yeah

// I Ain't Blue //

I ain't blue, baby
Just a little bit lonesome for some lovin'
Everything is fine
Just don't want to be all by myself

On a rainy day
I'm feelin' kind of funny
Dreaming 'bout some loverman who'll call me honey
Yeah and a good lookin' man
My heart inside
A lonely smile and lovin' in his eyes

No I ain't blue, baby
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again
Everything is fine
Just don't want to be all by myself

Sit around the house
Readin' magazines
All the time thinkin' 'bout those same sweet dreams
Yeah, walk down the street
My heart jumps a beat
Every time I see some sweet man I want to meet

No I ain't blue, baby
But I'm just a little bit lonesome for some love again
Everything is fine
I just don't want to be all by myself

// Women Be Wise //

Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man
Don't sit around gossiping, explaining what your good man really can do
Some women nowadays, Lord they ain't no good
They will laugh in your face, Then try to steal your man from you
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man

Your best girlfriend, she might be a highbrow, she changes clothes 3 times a day
What do you think she's doing now, while you're so far away
She's loving your man in your own damn bed
You better call for the doctor, mama, try to investigate your head
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man

Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man
Don't sit around, girl, telling all your secrets,
Telling all those good things he really can do
If you talk about your baby, you tell me he's so fine
Lord honey, I just might sneek up and try to make him mine
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man

Don't be no fool, don't advertise your man (baby don't do it)
