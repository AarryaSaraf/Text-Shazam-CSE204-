Well I went and gave away my TV
Told the man "cut off the phone"
I put an ad in the paper, baby,
Gonna sell everything I own
Done everything in the world I know
To try to make it through
There's just no getting over you

Well I went and bought myself a new straw hat
One eye pokin' under the brim
Bought myself a little seaside shack
In case I might just want to swim
Done everything I know in the world I know
To try to shake these blues but
There's just no getting over you

Well I try and try
But honey it ain't no use
Cry and cry
I just can't turn you loose
Why oh why
Can't I get you off my mind
You got that hook so far in
I gotta get you off my line

Well I got some transcendental meditation
And I'm taking up Japanese
I signed up at the cooking school
I'm going to pick up on some hard cuisine
Done everything in the world
Just to try to make it through
There's just no getting over you

Well I try and try
But honey it ain't no use
Cry and cry
Just can't turn you loose
Why oh why
Can't I get you off my mind
You got that hook so far in
I just got to get you off my line

Now listen to this one time
You know the way you do, honey

Well I just can't make it over
Can't seem to make it baby
No matter what I say or do baby
I can't make it over
Oooh
Well there's just no getting over you
