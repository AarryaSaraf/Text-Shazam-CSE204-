When you get home baby
Write me a few of your lines
When you get home little baby
Write me a few of your lines
That'll be consolation
Lord honey oh my worried mind

Left my baby
Standin' in the backdoor cryin'
Well I left my little baby
Standing in the backdoor cryin'
I never felt so sorry
Lord honey till he said goodbye

Kokomo me baby
Kokomo me right
Kokomo your mama,
She'll be back tomorrow night
I'd like to cry in your arms tonight
Baby don't you wanna go?
Right on to lemon light city
Sweet home kokomo

Go on down to the river baby
Goin' to sit down on the ground
Well I'm goin' down to the river baby
Goin' to sit down on the ground
And let the way of the water
Lord honey wash my troubles down

Kokomo me baby
Kokomo me right
Kokomo your mama,
She'll be back tomorrow night
I gotta cry with you baby
Baby don't you wanna go?
Right on to lemon light city
Sweet home kokomo
