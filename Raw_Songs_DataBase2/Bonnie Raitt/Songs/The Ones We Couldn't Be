It's hard to say now who left first, it used to seem so clear
You and I were tangled from the start
Somehow the scales just fell away and I'm left standing here
Blown open in the hole that was my part

I wrap the dark around me, there's no solace here tonight
Just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways we tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones we couldn't be

Looking through these photographs searching for a clue
How you and I got tangled from the start
Not even blood could forge a bond enough to get us through
Or stem the tides that pulled us far apart

I'm sorry for the ways I couldn't give you what you needed
For all the ways I strung us both along
They say it goes both ways and I suppose I could concede it
Seems to matter more now that you're gone

And though it seems much kinder just to leave some things unsaid
Like all the ways I tore myself apart
If you really want forgiveness, you better try the truth instead
It may not be enough, but it's a start

I wrap the dark around me and there's no solace here tonight
There's just wishing and regret for company
My glass is raised for all the ways we tried to get it right
And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
I'm so sorry for the ones
Sorry for the ones
I'm sorry for the one I couldn't be
