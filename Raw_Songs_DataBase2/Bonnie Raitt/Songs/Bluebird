Listen to my blue bird laugh she can tell you why,
Deep within her heart you see, she knows only right
Whoa-oo just light
There she sits this lofty bird the strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now she thinks only of you
Woo just you
So get all those blues, must be a thousand hues, and each is differently used
You just know, you sit there mezmerized by the deepth of her eyes
And if you categorize she got soul, she got soul, she got soul

Soon she's gon' to fly away, her sadness is her own
Leave beside her bath of tears, she'll go home
