Hey mister, we want you to know
We think you've taken this about as far as it can go
It's about to blow
You got nowhere to run
Why don't you sit back and watch the show

Used to drop your little darlin' off at Sunday School
Family values while you're gettin' some Behind the pool
She's nobody's fool
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter
Wants it bad as you

You jack up the rent, you call in a loan
Clear your intent is to screw 'em out of all they own
Throw the dog a bone
Well you'll be cryin' for mercy when your karma
Calls you On the Phone

Times are hard...Ain't it a bitch
Japanese are makin' you twitch
All your investments are turnin' sour
Kinda spoils your happy hour

Look around, we're comin' your way
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought you'd
Get away
What you say
Well, the way it looks from here
You won't have to wait
The way it looks from here

No need to hesitate
Have a party celebrate
The way it looks from here
You won't have to wait for hell to pay....
