Let me in

I can see the dancin', (let me in).
The silhouettes on the shade (silhouettes).
I hear the music (music),
All the lovers on parade (oh).
Open up (let me in), I wanna come in again,
I thought you were my friend.

Pitter patter of those fee-ee-ee-ee-eet.
Movin' and a-groovin' with that be-eat.
Jumpin' and stompin' on the flo-o-o-o-oor.
(Lemme in ) Let me in! (Open up.) Open up!
Why won't you open up that door? (Let me in.)

I hear (open up) music let me in (music).
I wanna come in again.
Let me in (let me in), a-well I heard it just then.
I thought you were my friend.

Pitter patter of those feet.
Movin' and a-groovin' with that beat.
Jumpin' and stompin' on the floor.
(Lemme in.) Let me in!. (Open up.) Open up!
Why don't you open up that door? (Let me in.)

I-ah-I (open up) hear music, let me in (music).
Oh, I heard it just then. Let me in. (Let me in.)
I wanna come in again
I thought you were my friend
