I watched him circle 'round the block
Finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked
Like all he had was time
Excuse me, ma'am, maybe you can help
The directions weren't so clear
I'm looking for Olivia Zand
They said I might find her here

Well I looked real hard and asked him
What she's got he's looking for?

Said there's somethin' I think she'd want to know
And I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick
Caught me by surprise
But somethin' about him gave me ease
Right there in his eyes

And just like that your life can change
If I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now
He'd be 25 today
No knife can carve away the stain
No drink can drown regret
They say Jesus brings you peace and grace
Well he ain't found me yet

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

He sat down and took a deeper breath
Then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost
How you left without a trace
I've spent years just trying to find you
So I could finally let you know
It was your son's heart that saved me
And a life you gave us both

And just like that your life can change
Look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest
And I was with my boy again
Well I spent so long in darkness
I never thought the night would end
But somehow grace has found me
And I had to let him in

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
