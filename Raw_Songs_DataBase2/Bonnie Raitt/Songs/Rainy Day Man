What good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry

Well it looks like another fall
My friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man

And it does me no good to pretend
When he's made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like I lose again my friend
Guess I'll have to look up my rainy day man

Rainy day man 
He don't like sunshine
Don't chase rainbows 
He don't need good times
Grey days roll in 
And then you'll see him
It's an empty feelin'
Now I need him

All those noble thoughts they don't belong
If you can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since I knew where I stood all along
Think I'll look up my rainy day man

Simple pleasures all evade you
And the store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
I said, ask again
Why don't you pray for rain

Oh, it looks like another fall
And my friends they don't help at all
And I'm feeling kind of cold and small
Think I'll look up my rainy day man
All I have to do is look at my baby
Look up my rainy day man
Oooo, look up my rainy day man
All I have to do
Is look up my rainy day man...
