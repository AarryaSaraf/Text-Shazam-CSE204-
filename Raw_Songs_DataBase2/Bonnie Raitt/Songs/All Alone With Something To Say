Like a heartbeat, timing is everything
I took a look at love when love looked away
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say

I've been thinking, tweaking, and rethinking
All the things that I would tell you someday
I can hear it while I'm sitting here
All alone with something to say

I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I should be writing a column to the people
On how not to let your love life slip away
It would be clever, witty, and titled
All alone with something to say

I wanna tell you I love you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
I'm sorry

All the nuggets of gold on my tongue
Pearls of wisdom coming in waves
How cruel is it that fate has to find me
All alone with something to say
All alone with something to say
