Traveling at night, the headlights were bright
And we'd been up many an hour
All through my brain
Came the refrain
Of home and its warming fire

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen
They come in between
The city's a tiring life
And the trains come and go
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

Traveling at night,
The headlights were bright.
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend
The flowers will send
The sweet smell of home in the breeze

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still
