Come back
Baby come back

Come back
Baby come back

This is the first time until today
That you have gone away
I'm asking you for the first time
Love me and love that stay

Stay, stay, stay, Yeeeah

Come back
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back

There is no use in crying
Because I'm more hurt than you
I shouldn't have been a virgin
But now my love is true

Uh, (yeah), uh, (all right), uh, yeah

Come back
Baby come back
Baby come back
Baby come back

Come back baby, don't you leave me
Baby baby don't you go
I want you to give me a second chance
You know I love you so (yeah)

Oh (all right), oh (come out), oh yeah

Come back
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back

Oh, won't you please come back (auh)

Come back
Baby come back
I said, baby come back
Oh, won't you please come back

Come back (don't wait too long)
I said, baby come back (oh yes)
I said, baby come back
I said, baby come back
