All my life, I tried to find someone to love me
And though the night is lonely when no one's there to hold me
I'd rather be alone than be without you
'Cause no one else will do

And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

All my days are spent this way no one to talk to
And oh, the rain keeps fallin' and I hear your voice keep on callin'
I'd rather be alone then be without you
'Cause no one else will do

And once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love like you
And nobody else will do

Nobody else will do
