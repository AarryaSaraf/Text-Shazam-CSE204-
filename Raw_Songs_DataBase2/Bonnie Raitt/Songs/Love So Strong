Every day you say
That you wish that I could go with you
Every night you keep on telling me
That you wish that I could follow you
Every time you keep on worrying me, yeah
You wish that I could go with you
But it's a good thing I didn't follow you
Do those funny things that you wanted me to do
You tried to bend my love, yeah
And you made a fool out of me

One time I know is not the same
When we used to play in the sun
We used to hold each other's hand
Remember, we'd play in the pond?
So all the good looks you have would not break my heart
My own heart still remains the same
Honey, you tried to bend my love
Make a big old fool out of me

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a look at my face
You will see that my future's still bright
Oh, bright as the sun in the sky, now honey
You're sure to see me shine
Shine as the stars in the morning
That brighten up the sky

Said my love is so strong (Said my love is so strong)
And my mind unchangeable (My mind's unchangeable)
You take a good look at my face (Take a look at my face)
You will see that my future is still bright (See that my future's still bright)

(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
Bright as the stars in the sky now, honey
(Treat her like the way you really should)
You're sure to see me shine
(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
Shine as the morning stars
(Treat her like the way you really should)
That brighten in the sky

Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good
(Treat her like the way you really should)
Treat her the way that you should
Ooooh, see me shine
(Treat her good, treat her good, treat her good)
(Treat her like the way you really should)
