Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine
He's a short order cook
Long on speed, short on spice
He reads his customers like a book
He's seen this, and he's done that
Now he's makin' fried eggs an art
But there's one thing he can't fix no how
There's a longing in his heart
He's tried for years to work it out
At the grill and at his home
Well he talks to his friends, talks to himself
He talks the chicken right off the bone
Talks to his woman and she understands
You know they're always eye to eye
She runs the join, They live out back
Small House under a Big sky
Well even the stars at night agree
The sky is falling apart
She knows cause she can feel it too
There's a longing in her heart
A longing in her heart
Longing in her heart
Well now you and me, we're just like them
We never wanted to be alone,
So we made a pact, sealed with desire
For a happier house and home
Only to find it doens't untie
The know where feelings die
There's a longing deep inside our hearts
And no one to tell us why
Our friends aren't looking for anything new
They wouldn't know where to look
Well her, she like running the joint
And he likes being a cook
Together they're doing very well
They're might glad they could
But there's a fire burning towards them now
Coming from a distant wood
And eve the stars at night agree
That the sky is falling apart
We know 'cause we can feel it too
There's a longing in our hearts
