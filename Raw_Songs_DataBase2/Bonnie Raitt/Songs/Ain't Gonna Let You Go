Love came and hit me
Straight on the lips
Nobody kisses
The better it gets, and baby that's all right
You got me standing beside myself
You know it ain't like me
It's like I'm somebody else
But baby that's all right

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go

I pled guilty, baby, of this terrible crime
You been lovin' me all of this time
And I must have been blind
What's gonna happen?
What'll I do?
Whatever it is, I wanna do it with you
I feel just fine

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you baby, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go

Ain't it peculiar how loves comes about?
When you're not lookin', you'd better look out!

You're not the man I was lookin' for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Feels so good
Now that I got you to myself
I'm gonna keep you for myself
Now that I got you
I don't wanna let you go

You're not the man I was looking for
You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more
Now that I got you baby, it feels so good
I don't wanna let you go
Now that I got you baby, I don't wanna let you go
