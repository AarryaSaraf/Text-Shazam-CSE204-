These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat, middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad, laying in a ditch?
I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on

And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fucking shit up, come on

Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement
Black folks grieving, headlines reading
Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear, but I'm holding him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear, but I'm holding him tight

Damn, why the fuck are they after me? Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid
But I'm a product of the system, raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton, wondering, 'who could save us?'
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, "Stay back, nigga!"
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done
Fuck you!

And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane
But you don't know our pain

And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fucking shit up, come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we're all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fucking shit up, come on

These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
