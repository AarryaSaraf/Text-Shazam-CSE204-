(I heard Sam was going solo)
Hot damn, you didn't know, so?
Well, I can blast fast or freak an ill type of slow flow
I'm hitting harder than Barry Bonds, so check the golden child
Throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild
With truck-tracks, rhymes on deck, breaking off niggas proper
Did dirt, dipped West 'cause I clown coppers (Yeah)
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em, most 'em couldn't see me
Mad advanced in my skills, I'm all about the dollar bills
From Pittsburgh to Cali, dropping bombs like that
Was on the D.L. with the squad, so I couldn't hold it back
Black, I regulate, I bust a big gate figure
Mobbing with that ill nigga with his finger on a bigger trigger
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps)
Making dough, eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (Yeah)
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
That's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(That's right)
So bust my sound, I put it down for the underground
I got the women 'cause I'm slamming, jamming
Got it going on, it's time for this new producer to rise
So open your eyes, I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

I remember days on the blocks
Where I slang slung, played punk cops
And mad props 'cause I ran with hard rocks (Yeah)
From 8-Balls to O-Zs, I made Gs (Say what?)
Then built up enough loot to buy keys
No gang affiliation, yo, I stood on my own two, pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (Right)
I mack, on top of that, I'm used to staying wicked, which is 24/7
You can ask my ex-hooker
But now I'm on some new improved shit
Making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate
I flipped the script a long time ago, on the five-o
When I discovered this new way to make my cash flow (Mm)
Yes, indeed-y, I wasn't greedy, got my niggas out the gutter
Now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy
Hip-hop fanatic causing static in the industry
These whack creators, I call 'em imitators (Uh, yeah)
Be trying to see me
But see, I'm unexplanatory with the fame and glory
That's why I gotta tell my story
With no disguise, a lot of niggas despise me
Because I'm on the up-rise, so I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Think you better recognize
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Think you better recognize

Well, I'm back in the mix with a bottle of Hennessey
So fire up a blunt, who's ever in the vicinity
Crazy shout-outs, giving pounds to all my niggas
Hitting all the hookers by the dozen 'cause they dig us (Trick)
Fuck what you heard, recognize what you be seeing
This down-to-Earth, true-to-the-game human being
I'm that little beige nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine
'Cause I'll incline with the mastermind
I got my crew in my corner so I can't lose
Plus, I'm paying mad dues in this record biz, I don't snooze
And suckers be popping that ol' idiotic egotistical type of flimflam
I can't be faded, Sam-I-Am
Blending with the hustlers
Never dealing with them knucklehead ballers
'Cause boys play with toys, and scholars play with dollars
I'm a mack on my own right, plus my game is tight
Baby, get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight
Bitches give me mad rhythm, but their brains are off-tempo
Thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots
I gotta be wise when time to dip between the thighs
All eyes on the prize, so I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
