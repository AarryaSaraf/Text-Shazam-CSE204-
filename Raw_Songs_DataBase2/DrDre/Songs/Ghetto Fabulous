Once again, we tango for cash
Ras Kass, Dr. Dre and Mack 10 connected
We ghetto fabulous baby
The best food, drink and pussy that money can buy

Every day of my life is off the ringer
That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava
So holler, we all hustle for dollar dollars
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C
We drinking V-S-O-P the beats be
Banging, catch me with a dime piece next to me
My body all over your body like LSG
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor
Rookies asking us how to be a player
Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked
No matter how much money you make
Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes
In jeans and tennis shoes, breaking your strict dress codes
Spit lyrical bricks, 13G
So I can be richer than Master P selling 'Ghetto D'

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles

You ain't heard of me, you ain't listening hard enough
Started in Compton serving from a ice cream truck
Now ten years later whipping a custom Navigator
Stepping on your toes player, scuffing up your alligators
I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me
Boom bap and slap that ass silly
This is for the full-time students slash part-time strippers
And young niggas, clocking at least five figures
Some of us pro athletes, some of us rap over fat beats
Some of us hustle in the streets
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
Tricking off a pocket full of singles, huh
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra
Pop a thirteen shot Glock to make you Go See the Doctor
Ain't nothing nice
From hood to hood, love living the lavish life

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this

Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS300 playing number-two Tekken
Zero to sixty in six point seven seconds
Hanging out the window acting up
Chicken heads like "You're doing four much!"
Flexing the Rolex oyster perpetual
Thirty-five diamonds across the face
Still eating out foam cups and paper plates
We don't call it player hating in the nine-eight, it's P.I
That's pass interference, automatic first down
Want Juice like 2Pac, then Obey Your Thirst clown
Be in the PJs in NY, rocking DK
Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say
"L.A. niggas got crazy game
Like John Elway got a Superbowl ring"
The homies down for whatever, we stack the cheddar
Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this

Ugh! And it don't stop!
Ha ha, west-side riders baby, ha ha!
