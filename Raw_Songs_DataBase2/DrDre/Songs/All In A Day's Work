Fear. Fear's a powerful thing. I mean, it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know. I just... go in

Sitting 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just looking at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles, looking like a villain laying low
Nothing I can do but pack it all up
Going up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feeling so rare tonight
Acting a fool and feeling alive
I'm fucking flawless like I live in a vault

Only type of living I know
(Only type of living I, only type of living I)
Yeah, see, if it was you, you would've killed yourself by now
(Only type of living I, only type of living I know)
It takes a special kind of motherfucker to live like this
(Only type of living I)
And they ask me how I do it
(Only type of living I know)
Motherfucker, just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the building
Ha, I hear you motherfuckers talking and all that, but uh
No, no, don't mention me at all
Yeah, coming live and direct
And I know you feeling some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say something
I thought it was all good (Hey)
But now you motherfuckers crossed the line and
Kinda pissing me off
All the fans and all the fame
And though I gave everything to this game, they still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fucking pressure
There's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

Work, hard
Working so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

My whole life, all I ever thought about is grinding
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylist
And that was back when I felt like
Rappers was true motherfucking riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fucking youngster, man
Shit I was still saying, "Fuck the police"
(Man, fuck the police)
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
(Motherfucking Hub City)
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong, so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV is talking 'bout pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck
When they running their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton, sick and tired
And some of these housewives way too fucking desperate
These bitches thinking fame first
I can't knock the hustle, shit, it's (All in a day's work)
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit, it's just something about that Hollywood curse
They just thirsty

Hard times
I double my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm getting the feeling like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
(Only type of living I) Only type of living I know
(Only type of living I) Only type of living I know
(Only type of living I) Only type of living I know
(Only type of living I know)

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work
Let's work

Rich as fuck, but, guess what?
I'm back to work (Yeah, I'm back to work)
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep
I'm back to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
So many people that I love, they want my time
But I got to work (I'm sorry, I'm back to work)
Some of my friends don't understand, shit
I got to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
Always talking 'bout busting the club
But I'm like, "Fuck that, I gotta work" (Fuck that, I'm working)
If you really wanna do it like this, shit
You better get back to work (I'm working, huh)
Back to work, right back to work (Right back to work)
Gotta get back to work (Right back to work)
Shit, right back to work (Right back to work, huh)
