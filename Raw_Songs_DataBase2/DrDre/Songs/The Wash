As the wheels turn city to city, hundred-spoke
Chronic smoke, twist up another Phillie (Done dilly)
(Them niggas still tripping off that old shit) Really? (How silly)
It's a whole another day (Yeah it is)
Snoop Dogg (and Doc Motherfucking Dre) Nigga can ya feel this?
(It's the D-O-double, ya don't run up ya won't see no trouble)
If you caught up in these fucking streets
(Who you gon' call when them niggas getting ready to blast?)
Yeah, and if that shit's getting ugly
(Who you gon' call when them niggas come to get in ya ass?)

I came to get in that ass, Bigg Di-Dogg, push the big hid-ogg
You're hopping and popping, how bout you hop up off my bid-alls
Got dirt on my pid-aws, I broke a few lid-aws
It really don't matter cause I'm only here to spit on
And get on and shit on niggas
Do it to 'em D-O-double, right on nigga
I'm sagging it, bagging it, slanging dubs
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds?
What's up cuz?

If you trying to get a dub sack page me
The hoes say "Dee Loc, you so crazy"
Popping that shit don't faze me
I need my chips and the dip, it's like gravy

Now back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feeling that demand
Los Ang', broad day gunning
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre coming
If this shit ain't played the party ain't bumping
If I don't show up the hoes ain't fucking
(Real talk) Cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All-Star League, you riding benches
I handles my business, fuck fake niggas
I sell game a quarter million a track
Snoop and the Good Doc back with a brand-new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I'll blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Running up, talking shit, get smashed
(Shoot first) Ask questions last

Falling back on that ass
Hit the switch and let the ass just drag
2001 & 2002 tags
My nigga what you holding?
Step out with the Stacey's and the Snoop Dogg Clothing
Rolling, with the braids in my hair
Cripped out, way pimped out, oh yeah
You gots to pay the cost to be the boss
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed
The Wash

The Wash
