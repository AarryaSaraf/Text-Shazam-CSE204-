My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low, bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol I think, but what do I know
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the body-bag
The shotty, the Mag Los Angeles, where the party at
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black Raiders starter cap
Gangster rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on a track

Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no starting I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky's the limit I'm paid to run the city now

Your skin's your traveling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistening
Vivid on my skin how many continents I've visit then
You could journey with me to different places by listening
Shitting on 'em, ya brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit the grind
My genetic code make-up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time when night meets day
I'm in a light grey Bugatti like a high-speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place
The Muhammad Ali hobbies no Pilates tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, baguette's glowing
Keep your lid yet dawg the private jet Boeing topless

Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no starting I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky's the limit I'm paid to run the city now
