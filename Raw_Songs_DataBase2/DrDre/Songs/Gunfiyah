Now will there ever be a day that my niggas won't ride for me? For me?
Nah, nah, nah
And will there ever be a day that your bitch won't slide with me? Homie?
Nah, nah, nah
And will it ever be a day that your hands ain't up when a nigga on stage
I been rolling up haze in the studio for days just to work for a wage
Now I'm on, fucking paid in this motherfucker
Who got a hit just like this? And got heart and rich like this?
Never failed, 20 years and he still got grip like this
And got kids with a super hot bitch like this
You spending time tryna get like this
I wrote a script like this, I'm on some shit like
I'm at home on the track, nigga, this my shit
Try to spit my clip, you might get hit and divided

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, or a enemy
Me got a few chains worth a hundred kis
Them say they waan romp, me say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on the streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, no wan romp with me

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid it out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

How you spell C.E.O.? D.R.E
What a nigga dream he could try to be
Uh, even though I'm from a place where
Niggas got TECs, don't mean technology
Grew up 'round Blood niggas, real camaraderie
Plus Crip niggas on the other side of me
But I'm the only nigga that I ever tried to be
Winner never sins, you know these niggas tired of me
Not to it if you want crap shooting in your home
Where a nigga came from, my life changed
'Cause a nigga made hits while my homies flipped bricks
Lot of them ain't here, can't complain
Tried to survive 9 to the 5
You ain't alive if you ain't not willing to die
The lower the low, the higher the high
Do or you don't, you fall or you fly
I mean you ride or die, nigga

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, those our enemies
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys
Them say they waan ride, mi say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on hundred streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, now I walk with weed
