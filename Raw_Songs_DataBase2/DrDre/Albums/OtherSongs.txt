// 12 Steps To Recovery //

Break out your fucking swishers
Light up your fucking weed
I'd like to introduce you all to The Chronic III
It's D R period Dre motherfucker
Back to set the record straight for motherfuckers

I gotta be the number one supplier
I keep you higher than Richard Pryor
I been the dope man since '86 ('86)
From a nigga with a attitude to a nigga that's fucking rich
I'm feeling better than I've ever been
A lot stronger, plus I got a bet I win (bet I win)
I'm taking all bets, fuck it I'm all in
And when I'm finished with this business I will be number
(One, one, one)
Started out on the turn tables, but look how the tables turned
You can't imagine what my label earned
I gross more in a year than most niggas make in their whole career
I'm only here (two, two, two) make sure I shake up your rear view
And you niggas could not see me with a clear view
If I was you I'd probably hate me too
'Cause yeah you got a budget but you can't fit Dre in it
It's (three) album solo, the Aftermath logo
Platinum plus 'cause I don't go gold, you know
My stats, ain't got enough wall for all my plaques
Niggas acting like I wasn't coming back
(Four) more, I'm too in love with this shit, plus I came too far to quit
And it was in nine (five) I got sick of niggas tripping and shit
So I started building my label, sometime in 9 (six)
Adjust the levels on my mic so it's loud and clear (testing)
This is something that I want the whole world to hear (world to hear)
(Seven) I'm tired of niggas blaming sales on the industry
The music ain't shit, and personally it's offending me

Twelve steps to recovery

Fucking with the D-R, find yourself an E-R
Need C-P-R, do you know who we are?
Love cognac and cigars, so high I don't see y'all
On a whole 'nother level, that's why I couldn't be y'all
(Eight) straight summers they've been patiently waiting
And I-, I'd like to thank you all for being patient
I-, I'd like to shout out all the critics for hating
'Cause you've only been the fuel for my motivation
(Nine) you cat's lives is limited
While I got black cards for all of my businesses
And there's (ten) million reasons why you can't fuck with Detox
And I'm the biggest influence in hip-hop
(Eleven) I can't stop (can't stop), look what I started (thanks to hip-hop)
I get the most pay, because I work the hardest
(Twelve) "Should've been Number 1 to me"
It's hard work to you, but it's fun for me

Twelve steps to recovery

// 187um (Deep Cover Remix) //

(I can feel it!)
Yeah, and you don't stop
It's still 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop

Niggas that I used to know and sold dope with
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit
And let me know it's something they can blast on
Thinking about the homies that passed on
Death Row come to show you where all the game at
And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me in, time is money
But never in the P-E-N, yo
Welcome back to Vietnam, California
Ain't a damn thing changed, so let me warn ya
Every motherfucking minute you on the Westside
The best side, 20 niggas done just died
Walking down the streets of L.A
Stay strapped 'cause niggas bust caps every day, yo
The 1-8-7 don't stop
On undercover cops up on the spot getting popped, shot
Dropping like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peeling back
So creep when you in the C-P-T
You catch heat for fucking with' the D-R-E
I got my eyes on the shit unfolding
And there ain't gonna be no tripping
'Cause they know the type of shit that I be holding
If there's another word said
I'll let my .44 go buck to the head, nigga

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop

3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1
Head away, sent away, get away, Snoop's got a gun
And he's looking for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix
Back on the streets with my khakis and my stars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar
Scared than a motherfucker, 'cause I'm fresh out
But I gots to make my green, and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yelling murder, but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop
Another nigga out, but I doubt
That you really give a fuck what it's about
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a motherfucking cop wanna knock with me
A C-O-N-V-I-C-T
The motherfucking D-O-G, coming from the L-B-C
Look at what the Doc brought in
A chrome .38, a .44 mag, and Mac 10
So what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi and my motherfucking .22
So if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!
(I can feel it!)

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop

Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall
Strong motherfucker 'cause he starts to crawl
I guess I gots to load the Glock again
Hit him with the hollow points and watch him spin
Fuck it, I had to do this quick
Grabbed the Glock 17, the clip went click
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him
That ought to stop from beating up blacks
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack
Relax, 'cause I'm about to take my respect
I aimed the 12 gauge straight for his neck
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! Then I fade into the wind
1-8-7 and it's on again
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
four-four Desert Eagle to your motherfucking dome
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
four-four Desert Eagle to your motherfucking dome
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip
Niggas, keep your hands on your motherfucking shit

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you
Pour my feelings out and spill it with you
That's a no-no, but what he don't know
Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pulling your weave
No, I'm kidding, I'm knowing my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept coming over and stayed persistent
You biting your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steaming up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you using my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest
But, fuck it, I'm going all out
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They trying to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fucking you on a chair

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

// Ask Yourself A Question (Bonus Cut) //

Check it out
Here's a penny for your thoughts, a nicklebag of bliss
An M-16 with eighteen clips
I'm all set to bust, treacherous
Illustrious, homie don't question us

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggas can I blast on sight?

I'm ferocious, and you knows this nigga
Bitches wear skirts, shake ass and bump
I pop pistols, that's all I do
I pop one at him and pop two at you
I'm illusive, I'm a glutton
Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance, I'm in my G4 stance
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at, or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and aah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
That I'm addicted to the fast life (Addicted to the fast life)
Shouts out to my homeboys Mad and Quell
You go on and fuck Misty, while I fuck Michelle

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggas can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
Is it cool to ride, or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us

What you wanna do, penetrate me?
Bump my crib? Bust and fuck my bitch, nigga?
I never thought a nigga would trip
Off a little piece of ass that he know he could get
Any day (Any day) and any time (Any time)
You'se a vegetarian (what?), I like beef, turkey and pork
Fish and chips, chips and dip
Fuck it, hand me my knife and my fork
I'm not too picky nigga, Kurupt young Gotti
A.k.a. Low Ricky nigga (what up momma?)
Substantialar, tyrannosaurus, gigantic, titanic tarantula
On a creep homie, wake up
Don't sleep homie, supposed to know it
Look, I'm hazardous to health, nigga, bitch, nigga
Don't ask me shit 'til you ask yourself

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggas can I blast on sight?

(Fuck is up?)
Man, life's a bitch
You gotta put your pistol to the sky
Kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
Man, you'se a motherfucking fool (Speak to these niggas)
I thought the same way back in the days
Young with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much, homie, never trip
I got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggas out to get you
It's a mistake forgetting to take your pistol with you (Your pistol, nigga)
Niggas get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
Yo nigga, that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the Indica without the Thai with it
Niggas look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone, you spit the harpoon
Wiping shit the fuck out, like typhoons
With the little homeboys, T-bone and cartoons (C'mon)
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit
Fuck everything you believe in, little bitch

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggas can I blast on sight?

// Back To Business //

They've been wondering if I'm gon' show
Shit, you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? Where you at? Where you headed?
This shit started to disappear, oh no-o-o-o
I'm right here, yeah
Shit, right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning (Yeah, six in the morning)
Until six in the morning (Best believe I'm on it)
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice
I live in the future
I'm blind to the moment
I, I, you ain't gotta say
Oh you ain't gotta lay around, we own it

And I remember when I was young, just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homies couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way, no how, can't stop
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we, bringing crowds like it's Woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it, yeah, god damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it? Hold up, homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
And if we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts
So they can start with the bank accounts

I've been away
But I see y'all still ain't catch us
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
They gonna say
Anything because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going, yeah I'm going
(I'm going, better believe I'm going) Oh
(I'm going) Oh
It's time to get back to business

This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I keep this bitch with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas, was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I gross
Getting back to the business and in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking, "Damn how far can I go?"
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill
That let me know that it's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL, the trap shit is on board, hold up (Bankhead!)
Think they gave the wrong nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't meant for me, they shouldn't have let me sit
The explanation for all the devilish shit we did
I'm grinding, handling my business nigga

So many miles in the air
Pardon me, I'm standing on my paper
Up, up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no mid around?
Take you to another atmosphere, smoke this
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
I can change your atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get your girl to feel my Johnson (Roll it up)
Smoke this (Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, get a lighter)
I can change your atmosphere, atmosphere
Smoke this

// Bad Intentions //

Super ugly!

Put your cups up, get your smoke in
Baby, we partying, ain't nobody loc'n
Who you provoking, what you want now?
Take a look around, it's pimp shit going down
It's a lot of bitches, a whole lot of freaks
Top notch hoes, they flock in every week
What you wan' do, get your next thrill
Take an X pill, how the sex feel?
Damn you looking good, all ten of y'all
Wanna roll (yeah!), I'm dicking y'all
Keep your face down, keep your ass up
You know what you're doing, keep that shit moving
Keep them titties jumping, keep the Henny coming
Every bitch in here need to be touching something
I know they like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?

I don't give a fuck cause I'm just
Drinking, smoking, straight West-coasting
Bitches putting ass in motion
Pussy popping, sex promoting
Got a cup? (Raise it up)
Got a blunt? (Blaze it up)
That's your bitch? (On these nuts)
Really I don't (Give a fuck)
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me, and she ain't playing
And what I'm saying
She creeps with me
And sleeps, between the sheets

Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes, they all wanna get chose
We never love y'all, my niggas all macks
We sip a lot of Yak, fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black
Thugs on their block wondering where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath
No talking, fuck how your day go
You want dick (yeah!), will bitch say so
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeah)
Time to get it cracking, show me them bad habits (ooh)

I don't give a fuck cause I'm just
Drinking, smoking, straight West-coasting
Bitches putting ass in motion
Pussy popping, sex promoting
Got a cup? (Raise it up)
Got a blunt? (Blaze it up)
That's your bitch? (On these nuts)
Really I don't (Give a fuck)
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me, and she ain't playing
And what I'm saying
She creeps with me
And sleeps, between the sheets

When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm saying is she ain't playing (she creeps with me)
And sleeps, between the sheets

Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeah!)
Nocturnal, L.A. Confidential (yeah!)
What up Infinite, Mahogany dropping the instrumental (yeah!)
Do the math, Aftermath gets the last laugh (yeah!)

// California Love //

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for California

California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we're wearing Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking

South Central
Uh, that's right
Now make it shake

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Shake it, Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco

And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West Coast, West Coast

// Deep Cover //

Hit this motherfucker, G
No, naw, man, I can't fuck with that
Aw, man, I been dealing with you for three motherfucking months, you ain't hit the pipe in front of me yet!
So, what you saying?
I think you 5-0!
5-0? Man, I ain't no motherfucking cop!
Well, hit this motherfucker then

"I can feel it!"

Tonight's the night I get in some shit (Yeah)
Deep Cover on the incognito tip
Killing motherfuckers if I have to, peeling caps too
'Cause you niggas know I'm coming at you
I guess that's part of the game, but I feel for the nigga
Who think he just gonna come
And change things with the swiftness
So get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission, and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxing at the top
I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop
Kingpin kicking back while his workers slang his rocks
Coming up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
But I got the hook up with somebody
Who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm looking for a big fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
'Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck, 'cause I'm going Deep Cover

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call him Snoop Eastwood
Kicking dust as I bust, fuck peace
And the motherfucking punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take yo ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre! (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feeling
Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chilling
Killing, feeling no remorse
Yeah, so let's go straight to the motherfucking source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be getting niggas a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on their team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock
So, what's up, nigga?
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfucking twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!
("I can feel it!")

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

Six-four-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie belled in the parking lot
The scene looked strange and it felt like a setup
Better not be, 'cause if it is, they're getting lit up!
Oh, here they come from the back in their 'llacs
I'm checking for the gats they strap, so what's up, black?
Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wanting none of my grip
'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?)
"We give you 20 Gs if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us."
Hmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him before I shot it
If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah
I'm letting my gat pop, 'cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

// Die Hard //

I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight

My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacing
Don't know if I'll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre's in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I'm sick

I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight

It's on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep'
Yep, face it, the fans they've been upset yet patient, I love 'em for that

I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won't go down without a fight

// Ghetto Fabulous //

Once again, we tango for cash
Ras Kass, Dr. Dre and Mack 10 connected
We ghetto fabulous baby
The best food, drink and pussy that money can buy

Every day of my life is off the ringer
That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava
So holler, we all hustle for dollar dollars
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C
We drinking V-S-O-P the beats be
Banging, catch me with a dime piece next to me
My body all over your body like LSG
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor
Rookies asking us how to be a player
Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked
No matter how much money you make
Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes
In jeans and tennis shoes, breaking your strict dress codes
Spit lyrical bricks, 13G
So I can be richer than Master P selling 'Ghetto D'

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles
We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles

You ain't heard of me, you ain't listening hard enough
Started in Compton serving from a ice cream truck
Now ten years later whipping a custom Navigator
Stepping on your toes player, scuffing up your alligators
I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me
Boom bap and slap that ass silly
This is for the full-time students slash part-time strippers
And young niggas, clocking at least five figures
Some of us pro athletes, some of us rap over fat beats
Some of us hustle in the streets
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
Tricking off a pocket full of singles, huh
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra
Pop a thirteen shot Glock to make you Go See the Doctor
Ain't nothing nice
From hood to hood, love living the lavish life

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles
We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles

Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS300 playing number-two Tekken
Zero to sixty in six point seven seconds
Hanging out the window acting up
Chicken heads like "You're doing four much!"
Flexing the Rolex oyster perpetual
Thirty-five diamonds across the face
Still eating out foam cups and paper plates
We don't call it player hating in the nine-eight, it's P.I
That's pass interference, automatic first down
Want Juice like 2Pac, then Obey Your Thirst clown
Be in the PJs in NY, rocking DK
Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say
"L.A. niggas got crazy game
Like John Elway got a Superbowl ring"
The homies down for whatever, we stack the cheddar
Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella

We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles
We ghetto, fabulous
Money make the world go round so let's handle this
Ghetto, fabulous
Broadcasting live from Los Angeles

Ugh! And it don't stop!
Ha ha, west-side riders baby, ha ha!

// Gunfiyah //

Now will there ever be a day that my niggas won't ride for me? For me?
Nah, nah, nah
And will there ever be a day that your bitch won't slide with me? Homie?
Nah, nah, nah
And will it ever be a day that your hands ain't up when a nigga on stage
I been rolling up haze in the studio for days just to work for a wage
Now I'm on, fucking paid in this motherfucker
Who got a hit just like this? And got heart and rich like this?
Never failed, 20 years and he still got grip like this
And got kids with a super hot bitch like this
You spending time tryna get like this
I wrote a script like this, I'm on some shit like
I'm at home on the track, nigga, this my shit
Try to spit my clip, you might get hit and divided

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, or a enemy
Me got a few chains worth a hundred kis
Them say they waan romp, me say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on the streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, no wan romp with me

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid it out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

How you spell C.E.O.? D.R.E
What a nigga dream he could try to be
Uh, even though I'm from a place where
Niggas got TECs, don't mean technology
Grew up 'round Blood niggas, real camaraderie
Plus Crip niggas on the other side of me
But I'm the only nigga that I ever tried to be
Winner never sins, you know these niggas tired of me
Not to it if you want crap shooting in your home
Where a nigga came from, my life changed
'Cause a nigga made hits while my homies flipped bricks
Lot of them ain't here, can't complain
Tried to survive 9 to the 5
You ain't alive if you ain't not willing to die
The lower the low, the higher the high
Do or you don't, you fall or you fly
I mean you ride or die, nigga

Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it
Laid out with the chalk around him
Came back as kings, came back with rings
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga

Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah
Set fire to my enemies
Fuck a rasclaat, those our enemies
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys
Them say they waan ride, mi say, "Pussy, please"
Pussy boy never worried me
My clips up on hundred streets
Nuh call the police pon me
A hundred keys in these streets
Pussy boy, now I walk with weed

// I Need A Doctor //

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm crying in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was riding to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fucking back-stabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Making wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they'll scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man!" 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

// Keep Their Heads Ringin' //

Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's going on
Thank God it's Friday

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

Hey you! Sitting over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me "Blacula"
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringing
The motherfucking D-R-E will keep their motherfucking heads ringing

(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect – plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringing
The motherfucking D-R-E will keep their motherfucking heads ringing

(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringing
The motherfucking D-R-E will keep their motherfucking heads ringing

(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their motherfucking heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringing!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Yeah, uh, come on!

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

I know you're bobbing your head
'Cause I can see you
I know you're bobbing your head
'Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Bitch!)
Yeah, that's right, we out

// Kush //

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute

Hold up, wait a minute

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

Now, this that puff, puff, pass shit
Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get yo' ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre, 3001, another classic
Go ahead, ask him, bitches, 'bout how I be smoking out
Party all night, yeah, it's going down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smoking all night
Yeah, puff puff pass that shit right here
Nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel complexion and her ass fat
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

I know you trying to get high
Type of shit that have you leaning sideways
Take a whiff of this suicide
Holler at me, 'cause I got it all day
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want that bom bom biggy?
Holler at my niggie right here in L.A
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

Hold up, wait a minute!
Let me put some kush up in it!
Hold up, wait a minute!
Let me put some kush up in it!

Still I am tighter than the pants on will.I.am
Back throw, back still, I have a pound in my backpack
Next to where the swishers at
Smoking presidential; got some bubba, I give me that
Need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and I'm the pimp in my Cadillac
You can tell them Cali back, matter fact
They'll know this ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
No, it ain't no seeds in my sack
You ain't never gotta ask, dog
What he smoking on? Shit, kush 'til my mind gone
What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, there ain't no question 'bout it
Niggas say, "Smoke me out," yeah, I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga homie
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

I know you trying to get high
Type of shit that have you leaning sideways
Take a whiff of this suicide
Holler at me, 'cause I got it all day
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want that bom bom biggy?
Holler at my, niggie, right here in L.A
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make yo' ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you can go put it back
'Cause what you got in your sack, boy, it ain't that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make yo' ass choke
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale!)

Niggas put my face on the milk carton, take the shit off
Cause I've been home with the kids instead of breaking shit off
I'm asthmatic, aftermath-matic, Dre want me in the booth
The room better be padded cause I'm Loko
Psychotic, six hundred wide body
Lost a couple mill last year, but why cry about it
Westside got a nigga back so I throw my dubs up
Never leave without my strap, it's like that
Got palm tree's, we coming through on three's
The A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H nigga we got a army
Aftermath general, one love to fifty
Ain't seen him in a minute though, used to be my nigga yo
Money changed niggas, but we the same niggas
Add fuel to the fire, that makes the flame bigger
But sometimes ego's clash with desert eagles
And I stayed loyal to the city where the weed grow (Compton)

(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)

// Let Me Ride (Remix) //

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

Creeping down the back street on Ds
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it
Seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9
Tryna take mine
Ya wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play
Day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the CPT, on a rhyming spree
A straight G
Hop back as I pop my top ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to
Pop! Pop! Pop!
Yeah cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another stop
Cause I'm

Rolling down the motherfucking back streets
With my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see
Ain't nothing but the G-funk, bumping in my G Thump
Hell yeah!
(With all the niggas saying)

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Hell yeah!)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(With all the niggas saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Hell yeah!)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

Just another motherfucking day for Dre
So I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangster glare
With gangster raps, that gangster shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
Uh, word to the motherfucking streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my 'fo on Ds
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cuz my '4 on hit
Pancake front and back, side to side
And all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah

Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce through the CPT
Diamond in the back, danas on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hitting in switches
Niggas getting jealous cause' hoes be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the 4 won't blow
Stopping by the spot to get some indo

With all the motherfucking bitches saying

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Hell yeah!)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(With all the niggas saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Hell yeah!)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Check this out)

Now as I roll with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Still clocking dough in 93 and 94, fuck a hoe
We blaze up the zig zags back to back
With the orange chronic bud blazing sack to sack
Humping, and bumping that doggy style
On the east side of the beach with the booming sounds
Got my drink on deck, got the strap and if the spot is feeling hot
Then feel the fire with my gin on rocks, it don't stop
Like I told you so, now let a nigga talk and flow, talk for riches
That way to get gold on gold on the black Liz-zac Coupe DeVille
Hydraulics and all that gangster shit, so
On and on and you know it don't stop, put it in motion and let it roll on 3 and pose like a pimp
And hit em up with the pound, relax and sip up on the drink and smoke with everybody saying

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Hell yeah!)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(With all the niggas saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

(Doing what you want, top billing)

(I let you ride) yeah, you wanna ride?

// Lil' Ghetto Boy (Remix) //

The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto

The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto

Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank
Cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time

We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' ghetto boy

Now I'm holding the dub, sitting on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I be making soon as I touch them streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
But it ain't no thang to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what?)
For trying to jack the little homies for they grip

We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' ghetto boy

Something for the real O.G.s to get with
Some facts made our made
Now you running but I'm played
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian
Gaming 'em for my homie
No need in be uncalm, if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack tight
Late nights, I wonder what they get in for?
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting for?
Seven young Gs put they serve down
In a G ride, Eastside's where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county
With nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustling ass youngster, clocking your grip

We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' ghetto boy

Lil' ghetto boy

That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto

That's the life of a G
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto
The ghetto
The ghetto

That's the life of a G. The ghetto
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto

Once again it's on, can't be home
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowing up the celly

The world knew I had to come once mo'
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow
Enough to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed
The most anticipated since Tyson's return
So come on everybody let's all get down

Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh

In other words, it's gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I'm seeing them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazing? I don't get it, their cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your
Check up
What partner? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burning down (Woof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas popping new shit, I never fear 'em

As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Break it down!
(Yeah, yeah)

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it

Like a punk full of bullshit, nigga hell nah

Good thing I had a couple hundred tums laying around
Nigga dispensaries, serving by the pound
Back in business, bigger than we ever was

We're leaving narcotics on every note
We just strutting the streets, like when the Levee broke
I got the antidote
I got ya hands going up and down, you done fucked up now
But it's hard to go back to that bullshit
And whatever's on the bar, D.R. is gonna push it

You can be my patient (I'm operating) all night
You can be my patient (Man I'm tryna fuck) all night

I beat that boom boom, down like your knees are
Legs spread out, like I'm mixed in a rebirth

Looks like it's too late to get ya girl
Now, cause now what? Now she's my girl
Now you ain't gotta go round no more

Doctor you got my prescription and it's keeping me alive

// Naked //

Exclusive! (exclusive)
Unreleased! Brand new! (brand new!)
Dr. Dre! From the private stash!
Straight from the vault, turn yo radio up!
Only on the Pharmacy baby!
Yeah! Whoo!
Seige Monstracity, good looking!

Red bottoms on a red head
Fake Molly, fed body
We get it popping when she at her best
Cause it's a party when she 'bout it (come on!)
Shots dropping, now she out her dress
And girls coming out the closet (Beats 1!)
A superstar on some private shit

Make a promise not to tell nobody
If she hot enough to get it, well get it girl
You know what it is, I don't get offended girl
(Sending this one out to all the excited dancers out there!)
(Geah! Get ya money)
Come and kick it with a player, enjoy your world
You better open up, let me hit it and join your world
Like the ceiling, reveal it before I kill it
She tried to go tell the city I loved her but no, I didn't
I fucked her no, I didn't, get comfortable doe-eye dipping
Then wonder what she was feeling
Her number does not exist in my phone, and I overlooked her
Her friends were looking me over
And I ain't got time for nothing
But you to come out them clothes and get naked

She gon' do it all for a player like me
I bet if she could she would make it naughty
You know what she do when she hang around me
She like to get naked
She don't have to worry 'bout shit for one night
All because we know we only getting one life
Probably because her momma don't know what she like

Yeah, take it easy
Yeah, strip tease me
(Let's get naked)

// Natural Born Killaz //

Shit, I'm tired as fuck
C'mon, baby, let's get the fuck home
Let's hurry up, I hate this neighborhood
Nigga' tripping over here and shit
Hey! Hey nigga!
Oh, shit!
Just keep walking, don't turn around
Hey homeboy! 'Sup motherfucker?
Here we go again
You and your motherfucking bitch, what's up?
Hey, nigga, why you fucking with me?
Fuck you nigga! 'Cause I can!

Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind state with a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck! Buck! Lights out
'Cause when I grab my sawed off, niggas get hauled off
(Ha, ha! Barrel one) Tears your motherfucking flesh
(Yeah, barrel two) Tears your fucking heart out your chest
You see, I'm quick to let the hammer go click, on my Tec-9
So if you try to wreck mine, fool, it's your bedtime
Feel the blast from the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Connor
Decapitation, I ain't hesitating to put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava, you got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is Revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a .44 mag and you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller, than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler, 'cause I'm a Natural Born Killer

Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma 'cause I scare her
I'm want to blast motherfuckers (yeah what's up?)
It feels like I'm busting a nut when I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb-ass raps
To make your lungs collapse, perhaps
You never sleep 'cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never, ever, ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're living
I'm the unforgiving, psycho-driven murderer
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it, goddamn it, schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson!
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick and I'm dancing

Mass murderer, Natural Born Killer
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wanna... die!

I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sounds of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumping on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
'Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold, and they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine, headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Get his ass whipped with 20 lashes like that dude up in Singapore
So I'mma pull a fucking Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

Tic Toc, Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order, making their lives shorter
Ready to slaughter
'Cause to me, a life ain't worth a quarter or a dime
Mushrooms got my mind, hallucinating, ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot-free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
'Cause I can't wait, I'm out the gate
On the for realer, a thrilla or a Natural Born Killa

Gitchi gitchi ya ya, they call me Dada
Six million ways to murder, choose one
Lose one soul, bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night

Should I peel him? (Yeah)
Should I peel her?
Am I iller (Hell yeah!)
Than a Natural Born Killer?

Should I peel him? (Yeah)
Should I peel her?
Am I iller (Hell yeah!)
Than a Natural Born Killer?

Should I peel him? (Yeah)
Should I peel her?
Am I iller (Hell yeah!)
Than a Natural Born Killer?

Should I peel him? (Yeah)
Should I peel her?
Am I iller (Hell yeah!)
Than a Natural Born Killer?

// No Diggity //

No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rolling with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, babe
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been digging you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)

No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)

No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

Yeah, come on
Maggie in full effect

Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day, yo

So on this spot getting popped, shot
Dropping like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peeling back
So creep when you in the C.P.T
You catch heat from fucking with' the D.R.E

Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop

Head away, sent away, get away snoop's got a gun
And he's looking for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix
Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar
Scared as a motherfucker, cause I'm fresh out
But I got to make my green, and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yelling murder, but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop
Another nigga out but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a motherfucking cop wanna knock with me
A C.O.N.V.I.C.T, the motherfucking D.O.G, coming from the L.B.C
Look at what the doc brought in
A chrome 38, a forty-fo' mag, and mack 10
So what you wanna do? (what you wanna do?)

So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!

Yeah, and you don't stop
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop

Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall
Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl
I guess I gots to load the Glock again
Hit 'em with the hollow points and watch him spin
Fuck it, I had to do this quick
Grabbed the Glock 17, the clip went click
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him
That ought to stop from beating up blacks
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack
Relax, cause I'm about to take my respect
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck
Boo-ka! Boo-ka! Then I fade into the wind
1.8.7 and it's on again
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on

Smooth as E & J, hard as Bacardi
Smacking those yaddy-yacks ducks that keep quacking
Hens that are cackling, end up crackling
Under the heat, the pressure from the one that's deffer

Got the eyes that are beady, body from Tahiti
Voice of the wind lyrics, blow
Chills up your spine I send, so
All thoughts in your mind drop 'em yo
You came in the front but you'll be kicked through the back door
If you try to step, try to come incorrect
Try to play the left, try to start a mess
Try to cause a fuss, try to raise a ruckus
Huh, you'll end up ashes to ashes, dust to dust
A buster, you must've been bugging on drugs
And alcohol back off, all a y'all, up against the wall
Spread 'em, Doggs – go get 'em
Hand-cuff 'em and stuff 'em, cold shut 'em, don't let 'em
Utter a word, not to mother or Herb
If you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred
Served with a cherry on top
Rage in effect I just begun to rock
Yeah rock on with your bad self (Rage)
Rock on with your bad self (Rage)
Rock on with your bad self (Rage)
Rock on with your bad self

Yo, I'm Dat Nigga Daz who packs a tre-8 slug

Motherfucker don't you know I'm stranded on the Row
I take a look into the crowd kick a style a flow
I'm mashing, motherfuckers get murdered for asking
Relax kid, you're rolling with a fucking assassin
I last did dirt the other day
Portray, the role of a G, from the D-O double G
P-O-U-N-D, Pound so bow bow motherfucking marks
The execution starts, when the Chronic is sparked
I'm like Barkley, rough and rugged, but raw like Rawhead
Rex, I flex murderous rhymes to leave you all dead
What's said is what's said, it's already spoke
The dead is the dead I ain't no fucking joke
I murder motherfuckers as a hobby
One of my idols ain't no joke, so why in the fuck should I be
Fly me, to the Bahamas, ruff rhymer, dramas
What you're kicking, wicked is how I'm 'a
Approach you, the locster, who's quick to up and smoke you
You're looking like a smoker, grinning like the joker
I yoke you from the back like a bitch talking shit
Cause a bitch ain't shit but a ho and trick, on my dick
Flip, let's take a trip to the Dogg Pound
Fools tried to punk me when I was young, but I'm a hog now
And I gets respect and I step with a Tec 9
Ready to put something up in that ass so you respect mine
Fool, Death Row ain't lynching and the Pound ain't mobbing
We all don't give a fuck, run in your crib and start robbing
Throbbing, I'll break a nigga down in the 90s
Maxing at the Pound with my dogs is where you'll find me, bitch

Hell yeah
You niggas can't fade this shit, you know what I'm saying
Death Row's in the motherfucking house
The Dogg Pound's definitely in here, you know what I'm saying
And ay yo yo yo yo yo, you niggas can't fuck with this
So don't even try it
Stay in the studio all you want, stay in the studio all you want
Cause you can't fuck with this, see ya

// Put It On Me //

Y'all ready to get dirty?
Do y'all really wanna get X-rated?
He, bottoms up
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back, I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
We back, we mack, stay blunted
Knee pads, yo hoes they wanted
Penthouse two o'clock eleven hundred
It ain't no fun if I can't reroute your hoes in this direction
Swerve in the intersection, I'm done, she resting
No question, done session
Home wrecking, Doc motherfucking Dre, no guessing
Nothing less than, I mess when I'm sexing
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes
But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the Benzos
Squatting real low, got me driving real slow, she's a real ho
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school chip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts
She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands 'cause Suga Free palming
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh, she okay, she just running an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncing through the mall, spotting 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him patting his pocket and coming out his drawers
Laying his jacket on puddles, opening the doors, all for what?
Because I promised her my name
Gave her the game and still ain't fucked
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back, I got what you need
Won't you just put it on me
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Fuck everybody, let's just go
(Come on baby)
We can get drunk, have some fun and blow some smoke
(Come on baby)
My spot is close, c'mon let's roll
(Don't trip)
Now keep it on a low, low
Now we just kicking back playing on some PS2
Contemplating the game Dre and me best do
If you feeling froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteeing you bitches leaving three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probably outlast you
You're like see-through pair of boxers nigga yo ass through
Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga
That's yo bitch, that's yo biz
That's show biz, that's how hoes is
With or without kids
Long as you keeping it on a hush she riding dick
Ain't been satisfied much, she's been faking
That's why she calling me, guess what she's saying
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company
(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me
Kick back I got what you need

(Come on baby)
Put it on me
Fuck everybody let's just go

(Come on baby)
My spot is close, c'mon let's roll
(Don't trip)
Now keep it on a low, ah

// The Wash //

As the wheels turn city to city, hundred-spoke
Chronic smoke, twist up another Phillie (Done dilly)
(Them niggas still tripping off that old shit) Really? (How silly)
It's a whole another day (Yeah it is)
Snoop Dogg (and Doc Motherfucking Dre) Nigga can ya feel this?
(It's the D-O-double, ya don't run up ya won't see no trouble)
If you caught up in these fucking streets
(Who you gon' call when them niggas getting ready to blast?)
Yeah, and if that shit's getting ugly
(Who you gon' call when them niggas come to get in ya ass?)

I came to get in that ass, Bigg Di-Dogg, push the big hid-ogg
You're hopping and popping, how bout you hop up off my bid-alls
Got dirt on my pid-aws, I broke a few lid-aws
It really don't matter cause I'm only here to spit on
And get on and shit on niggas
Do it to 'em D-O-double, right on nigga
I'm sagging it, bagging it, slanging dubs
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds?
What's up cuz?

If you trying to get a dub sack page me
The hoes say "Dee Loc, you so crazy"
Popping that shit don't faze me
I need my chips and the dip, it's like gravy

Now back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feeling that demand
Los Ang', broad day gunning
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre coming
If this shit ain't played the party ain't bumping
If I don't show up the hoes ain't fucking
(Real talk) Cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All-Star League, you riding benches
I handles my business, fuck fake niggas
I sell game a quarter million a track
Snoop and the Good Doc back with a brand-new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I'll blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Running up, talking shit, get smashed
(Shoot first) Ask questions last

Falling back on that ass
Hit the switch and let the ass just drag
2001 & 2002 tags
My nigga what you holding?
Step out with the Stacey's and the Snoop Dogg Clothing
Rolling, with the braids in my hair
Cripped out, way pimped out, oh yeah
You gots to pay the cost to be the boss
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed
The Wash

The Wash

// Topless //

My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low, bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol I think, but what do I know
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the body-bag
The shotty, the Mag Los Angeles, where the party at
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black Raiders starter cap
Gangster rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on a track

Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no starting I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky's the limit I'm paid to run the city now

Your skin's your traveling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistening
Vivid on my skin how many continents I've visit then
You could journey with me to different places by listening
Shitting on 'em, ya brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit the grind
My genetic code make-up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time when night meets day
I'm in a light grey Bugatti like a high-speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place
The Muhammad Ali hobbies no Pilates tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, baguette's glowing
Keep your lid yet dawg the private jet Boeing topless

Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no starting I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky's the limit I'm paid to run the city now

// U Better Recognize //

(I heard Sam was going solo)
Hot damn, you didn't know, so?
Well, I can blast fast or freak an ill type of slow flow
I'm hitting harder than Barry Bonds, so check the golden child
Throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild
With truck-tracks, rhymes on deck, breaking off niggas proper
Did dirt, dipped West 'cause I clown coppers (Yeah)
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em, most 'em couldn't see me
Mad advanced in my skills, I'm all about the dollar bills
From Pittsburgh to Cali, dropping bombs like that
Was on the D.L. with the squad, so I couldn't hold it back
Black, I regulate, I bust a big gate figure
Mobbing with that ill nigga with his finger on a bigger trigger
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps)
Making dough, eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (Yeah)
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
That's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(That's right)
So bust my sound, I put it down for the underground
I got the women 'cause I'm slamming, jamming
Got it going on, it's time for this new producer to rise
So open your eyes, I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

I remember days on the blocks
Where I slang slung, played punk cops
And mad props 'cause I ran with hard rocks (Yeah)
From 8-Balls to O-Zs, I made Gs (Say what?)
Then built up enough loot to buy keys
No gang affiliation, yo, I stood on my own two, pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (Right)
I mack, on top of that, I'm used to staying wicked, which is 24/7
You can ask my ex-hooker
But now I'm on some new improved shit
Making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate
I flipped the script a long time ago, on the five-o
When I discovered this new way to make my cash flow (Mm)
Yes, indeed-y, I wasn't greedy, got my niggas out the gutter
Now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy
Hip-hop fanatic causing static in the industry
These whack creators, I call 'em imitators (Uh, yeah)
Be trying to see me
But see, I'm unexplanatory with the fame and glory
That's why I gotta tell my story
With no disguise, a lot of niggas despise me
Because I'm on the up-rise, so I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Think you better recognize
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Think you better recognize

Well, I'm back in the mix with a bottle of Hennessey
So fire up a blunt, who's ever in the vicinity
Crazy shout-outs, giving pounds to all my niggas
Hitting all the hookers by the dozen 'cause they dig us (Trick)
Fuck what you heard, recognize what you be seeing
This down-to-Earth, true-to-the-game human being
I'm that little beige nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine
'Cause I'll incline with the mastermind
I got my crew in my corner so I can't lose
Plus, I'm paying mad dues in this record biz, I don't snooze
And suckers be popping that ol' idiotic egotistical type of flimflam
I can't be faded, Sam-I-Am
Blending with the hustlers
Never dealing with them knucklehead ballers
'Cause boys play with toys, and scholars play with dollars
I'm a mack on my own right, plus my game is tight
Baby, get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight
Bitches give me mad rhythm, but their brains are off-tempo
Thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots
I gotta be wise when time to dip between the thighs
All eyes on the prize, so I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize
Once again, it's the man with the master plan
They call him Sam and I think you better recognize

// Under Pressure //

The long-awaited Detox, trick
'Cause maybe I don't wanna stop, maybe I don't wanna quit
Maybe I like hoes, maybe I don't want a wife, maybe I'm psycho
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm strapped right now, just maybe
Maybe it's a relapse
Maybe I'm high right now; where the weed at?
Maybe this is ER
Maybe I'm a real doc' and this is CPR
Maybe we need to breathe some life in this shit
Maybe we are the life of this shit
Maybe I'm just crazy (Crazy)
What they say? (What they say?) Sak pase (Sak pase)
Nap boulé (nap boulé) Ayyy

Ugh, ah
Dre, I think I need my sponsor

I'm just outta contro-o-ol
Maybe I got hoes, every little city I go, like Paco
We tryna grow, but I just can't seen her
I'm having trouble cleaning up, I'm like FEMA
All these little haters got me back with the Nina
Got me bringing guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
Uh, I don't know if it's the Goose talking
But you know they say the liquor get your truth talking
Maybe I should be somewhere in the group talking
I'm addicted to coupes and taking roofs off 'em
I'm addicted to watches, Heckler and Koches
Them bow-legged girls from the projects
It's Bed-Stuy in this bitch (Bed-Stuy!)
Dre, what's up? (It's Westside over here)
I'm in this party, I'm up to no good
And I should be ducking these clubs, Tiger Woods

I smoke (I smoke), I drink (I drink)
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
Nigga, don't ask why (Ask why), I get high (I get high)
I'm just living my mo'fucking life
So what? I'm drunk (I'm drunk)
And I'm a weed head (Weed head)
And I'ma treat every day like the weekend
Headfirst off the deep end
Yeah, you know what's happening
I'm just relapsing

// Zoom //

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah

Uh, you know you a freak
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak
And now you're skin grinning, gassed off the chrome rims and
Twenty room mansion, I rest my Timbs in
Uh, I feel it how ya shake it
Rings in ya belly, I can't take it
Toss up your Moët, money make it
Last week fronting, tonight butt naked
I got the flavor, make em zoom-a-zoom
The LL Cool J, give me room
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom
Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uh

All I wanna do, is zoom-a-zoom zoom zoom
(Mm, what you wanna do) Uh, what you wanna do?

All I wanna do, is zoom-a-zoom zoom zoom
(Mm, what you wanna do) Uh, what you wanna do?

Once again it's on, can't be home
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowing up the celly phone
The world knew I had to come once mo'
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow
Enough to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed
The most anticipated since Tyson's return
So come on everybody let's all get down
(LL Cool J: Cause what we have, is a brand new sound)

All the mommies in the house getting live tonight
They wanna (zoom zoom zoom, zoom zoom-zoom)
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight
They wanna (zoom zoom zoom, zoom zoom-zoom)
Say what?

All I wanna do, is zoom-a-zoom zoom zoom
(Mm, what you wanna do) Uh, what you wanna do?

All I wanna do, is zoom-a-zoom zoom zoom
Dre, what you wanna do?
Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh

In other words, it's gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I'm seeing them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazing? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your check up
What partner? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burning down (Woof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas popping new shit, I never fear 'em

As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Work and die
(Yeah, yeah)

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah
