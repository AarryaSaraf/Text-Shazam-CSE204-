Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable

Heedless in our slumber
Floating nescient we free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite

Come our end suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly

To the quickened
Dissolution pray
We mitigate the ruin
Calling all to arms and order

Drifting through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making

Sound our dire reveille
Rouse all from our apathy

Lest we cease to be

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order

Sound the dread alarm through the primal body
Sound the reveille
To be or not to be

Rise
Stay the grand finale
Stay the reading of our
Swan song and epilogue

One drive to stay alive
Elementary. Muster every fiber
Mobilize
Stay alive

Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order
