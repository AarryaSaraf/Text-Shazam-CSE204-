Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me,
Lets me see.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me.
Lets me see

There is so much more
And beckons me
To look through to these
Infinite possibilities.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn outside the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind.

Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.
Reaching out to embrace the random.
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.

I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow
To feel inspired, to fathom the power,
To witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
To swing on the spiral, to swing on the spiral,

To swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.

With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in.
I feel it move across my skin.

I'm reaching up and reaching out.
I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me.
Whatever will bewilder me.

And following our will and wind
We may just go where no one's been.
We'll ride the spiral to the end
And may just go where no one's been.

Spiral out. Keep going. 
Spiral out. Keep going. 
Spiral out. Keep going. 
Spiral out. Keep going.
