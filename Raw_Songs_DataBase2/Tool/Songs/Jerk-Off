Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here, but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach

Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line

But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you
And maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole
I'm tired of waiting

Someone told me once
That there's a right and wrong
Punishment was cure for those
Who dare to cross the line

But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you

And maybe it's just bullshit
I should play God
And shoot you myself

Tired of waiting

Consequences dictate
Our course of action
And it doesn't matter what's right
It's only wrong if you get caught
If consequences dictate
My course of action
I should, I should play God
And just shoot you myself
Tired of waiting

Die now

Shoot it
Kick it
Fuck it
Shoot you in your fucking head
