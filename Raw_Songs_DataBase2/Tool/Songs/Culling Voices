Disembodied voices deepen my suspicious tendencies
Conversations we've never had
Imagined interplay
Psychopathy. Don't you dare point that at me

Heated altercations we've never had, so I'm told
Yet guided by them all
Every single one

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

Judge, condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence
Only the whispers from within

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

(Imaginal interplay, Imaginal interplay)
(Psychopathy) Don't you dare point that at me

(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
(Don't you dare point that at me)
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at
