Get up, get up now 
Get up, get up now 
Get up, get up now 
Get up, get up now 


Free yourself from yourself 
Free yourself from yourself 


Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
A cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and take it back in

You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it all
Take it all in

All the way in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in

You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way in
All the way
All the way
Way in!

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it up, take it up higher
4 degrees now, 4 degrees warmer
Give in now
Give in now

Let me in!

You'll like this in
This brings us out
You'll like this
It brings us closer than
Dying and cancer and crying
Let's take it, take it...

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it

Just like that
Just like that
Just like...
