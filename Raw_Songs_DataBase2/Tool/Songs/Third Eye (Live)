"Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself, you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself... Think for yourself... Order... Regulations... Rules... Think for yourself, question authority. Order... Regulations... Rules... Comfort us..."

Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

In... out... in... out... in... out...

A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

"So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?"

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

"So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?"
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?"

Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
And there we were

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
And there we were

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
You thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and the reason

Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
