I met a boy wearing Van, 501,
And a dope Beastie T,
Nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
Back from '92,
From the first EP.

And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up to the man.

Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point the finger you should know that I'm the man,
And if I'm the man, then you're the man, and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

So I've got some advice for you, little buddy.
Before you point your finger you should know that I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass.

All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck.
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, then you bought one.

All you read and wear or see and hear on TV is a product waiting for your fatass dirty dollar

So, shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
Buy, buy, buy,
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy.
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy.
