Choices always were a problem for you.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,
What you need is someone strong to guide you..
Like me, like me, like me, like me

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't you judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you.

My God's will becomes me.
When he speaks, he speaks through me.
He has needs like I do.
We both want to rape you.


Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now
Open my eyes and blind me with your light now

Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now
Open my eyes and blind me with your light now


If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't you judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.


Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now.
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now.
