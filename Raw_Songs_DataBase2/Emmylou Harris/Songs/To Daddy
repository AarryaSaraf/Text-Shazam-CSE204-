Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy
The only thing that seemed to be important to her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy

He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy

One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy

She said the kids are older now they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long but I just can't keep holding on
She never meant to come back home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Goodbye to daddy
