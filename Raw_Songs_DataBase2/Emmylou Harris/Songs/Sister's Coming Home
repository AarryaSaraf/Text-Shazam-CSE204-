Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
The whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long

Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong

Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' to the rock' n' roll
Sister's like to do it, Lord
Sister's like to move her soul

Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' on the hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
Than they did before
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before

She likes to move her soul
She likes to move her soul
Sister likes to do it, Lord
Sister likes to move her soul

Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
And the mirror's gonna tell her
How long she's been gone

Sister's comin' home
