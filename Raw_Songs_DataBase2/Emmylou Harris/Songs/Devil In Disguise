She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Now a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can do without

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise

Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's alright to call her but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time

She's a devil in disguise - you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies - she's a devil in disguise - in disguise
in disguise (in disguise) in disguise (in disguise)
