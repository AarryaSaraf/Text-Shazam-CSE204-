Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must've fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Oh, I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I'd been feeling over you
But they said it really loud and said it on the air
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...

Now don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming home real soon

Oh... he kinda a made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it for yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really mean
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...

Now if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
He found he really lied he said he really lied
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...
