Bad news black day
Ther's been a wreck on the highway
Drivin' fast in distress
Hit a curve and died in the darkness

He'll never know how much I lose
Bad news
Bad news sirens whine
He rode the devil down the white line
Johnny Walker by his side
Always our there lookin' for the last ride

He'll never know how much I lose
Bad news
