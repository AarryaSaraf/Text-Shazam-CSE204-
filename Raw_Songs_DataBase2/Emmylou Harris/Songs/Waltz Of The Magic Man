The very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

He asked me if I'd like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn

And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast 'til we left the ground

Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as we'd come
Then he'd wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And we'd keep climbing through the midnight sun

On a rocking horse with wings we'd fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky

So dance with me, dance with me, sing with me can't you see
I'm following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere, anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can

And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as he danced away
You know I can't even save my own

And now when I look up I see
The stars are dancing the same as he
I think of him wherever he may be

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled

And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
Charmed me like a piper
When he smiled
And he danced
