Spanish is a  loving tongue
Soft as music light as spray
Was a girl he learned it from
Living down Sonora way
He don't look much like a lover
But he says her love words over
Mostly when he's all alone
Mi amor mi corazon
On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers
How those hours would get to flyin'
All too soon he'd hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone
Mi amor mi corazon
He ain't  seen her since that night
He can't cross the line you know
They want him for a gambling flight
Like as not it's better so
Yet he's always sort of missed her
Since that last sad night he kissed her
Lost his heart left her own
Adios  mi corazon
Lost his heart left her own
Adios  mi corazon
