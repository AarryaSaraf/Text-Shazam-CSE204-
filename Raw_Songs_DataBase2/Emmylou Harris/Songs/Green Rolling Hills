The green rolling hills of West Virginia
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
Though the times are sad and drear
And I cannot linger here
They'll keep me and never let me go

My daddy said don't ever be a miner
For a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
'Cause the hard times everywhere
I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known

So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me here
Though I'll leave the past behind
I'll never change my mind
These trouble times are more than I can bear

But someday I'll go back to west Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well
Yes someday I'll go home
And I know I'll right the wrong
These trouble times will follow me no more

Yes someday I'll go home
And I know I'll right the wrong
These trouble times will follow me no more
