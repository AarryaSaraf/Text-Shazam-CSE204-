I'm not much on mystery
Yeah you gotta be careful what you dream
I thought this might pass with time
Yeah I thought I was satisfied

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I, got a thing about you

Somewhere deep in the middle of the night
Lovers hold each other tight
Whisper in their anxious ears
Words of love that disappear

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I, got a thing about you

Baby you hold some strange control over me
Yeah it's so wild it hypnotizes me
