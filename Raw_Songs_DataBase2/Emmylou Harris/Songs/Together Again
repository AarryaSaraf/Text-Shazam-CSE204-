Together again  my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
But nothing else matters cause we're together again

Together again the grey skies are gone
You're back in  my arms right where you belong
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters cause we're together again

Together again  my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters now we're together again
No  nothing else matters now we're together again
