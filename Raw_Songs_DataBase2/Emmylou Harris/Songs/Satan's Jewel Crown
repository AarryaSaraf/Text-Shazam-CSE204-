Now if I were a queen and a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
Well, I'd rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward
Would be Satan's jewel crown

Satan's jewel crown
I've worn it so long but God for my
Soul has reached down
His love set me free
He made me His own, and helped me cast off
Satan's jewel crown

Oh, the life that I live so sinful and needless
Drinking and running around
All the things that I do for the love of the devil
I know my reward
Will be Satan's jewel crown

Satan's jewel crown
I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free
He made me His own, and helped me cast off
Satan's jewel crown
