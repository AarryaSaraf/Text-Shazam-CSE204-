I don't belong to no one
I don't belong at all
Got my face in the corner
Got my back to the wall

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

I'm a hair trigger lover
And I can't face up to nothing
I'm impatient with the wind
But I'm waitin' here for somethin'

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too

Restless sleep, twisted dreams
Moving targets, silent screams
Restless city, restless street
Restless you , restless me

I'm a face at the window
I'm a black satin sheet
And I can't stay warm
I stay out in the street

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless, restless
You look restless too
