Well it's saturday night
You're all dressed up and blue
I've been watchin' you go out
Maybe you been watchin' me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arms some girls want
A sweet talkin' Romeo
We'll 'round here baby
I've learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Yeah, the road is dark
And it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you anytime
Maybe your other girlfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well, I don't know, baby
Maybe you've been around too
But there's another dance, baby
All you got to do is say yes
And if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
