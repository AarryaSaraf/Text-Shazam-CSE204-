Don't think that I'll be hangin' 'round
While you're havin' fun
I won't sit there cryin' over you
Well from now on when you step out
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

Now everytime you come in late and we begin to fight
You tell me there are more fish in the sea
But the bait ain't what it used to be
And I got news for you
Now after this when you go out
Well I'll go steppin' too

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

>From now on when you come in
And won't tell where you been
With your hair messed up
And your clothes don't fit you right
Well I don't care if I find perfume on you too
Well you will know that I have been
Steppin' just like you

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too
