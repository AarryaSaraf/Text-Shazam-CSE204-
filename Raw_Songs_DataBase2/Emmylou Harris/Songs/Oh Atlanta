Well, there's a place down Kentucky
Said right down near Ohio
You can watch the planes at night
People line up to watch each flight

I said a-watchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight

Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you

You can drop me off on Peachtree
I got to feel that Georgia sun
And the people in Atlanta
They make you awful glad you come

I said a-watchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight

Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you

We'll go down, just you and me
Where the music plays all night
They've got the boogie band playin' that's bound for hell
When they get to movin' they never stop

They just keep on playin' that down home beat
(Keep on layin' down harmony)
Yeah I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight
