Soul mate
I see you down there
Waiting for morning
To softly be coming
I find
I'm only in deeper
And you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared

Your true love
Has made you feel better
But look out for later
When she makes you feel worse
Times change
In daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is
All I have seen

But you're supposed to be feeling good now
Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind
That the prophets would lie
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out
Over someone like me

Soul mate
The blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing
We're on the wrong road
One side
Is just like the other
Except for the color
And size of the load
And just how much it shows
