Gliding bird gliding through the sky
I'm wondering why I can't be why I can't be as free
Gliding bird gliding all day long
Sing your secret song away from all these faces that I see
Is where I want to be

My feet are so tired
They walked too many miles
If I run so wild like heaven's child
I'll learn to fly someday

Gliding bird riding in the sun
Rainbow colors run
I hear the wind
I hear its mournful call

Gliding bird high above the sea
Is it longing to be free
Your voice is silent
But your wings tell all
