She was going to pieces when he walked in the door
She had to see him she can't wait no more
Tonight she'll be with him no matter the cost
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz

And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh   three quarter only
See how he holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz

He tells her he loves her as the music plays on
He tells he loves her but someone's at home
The ball game's all over and she knows she's lost
As the band plays   The Last Cheater's Waltz

And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh  three quarter only
See how he  holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz
