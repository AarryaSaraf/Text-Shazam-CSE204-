There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by faith, you see
Yes I want to see my Jesus
Shake His hand and have Him greet us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells a-ringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

When our days have known their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the Kingdom mends the spirit to be free
There'll be no more stormy weather
We'll live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells a-ringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
