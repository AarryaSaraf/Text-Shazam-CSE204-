// Sister's Coming Home //

Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long
The whole day long
Sister's comin' home
Mama gonna let her sleep the whole day long

Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong

Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' to the rock' n' roll
Sister's like to do it, Lord
Sister's like to move her soul

Down at the local beer joint
Dancin' on the hardwood floor
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before
Than they did before
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter
Than they did before

She likes to move her soul
She likes to move her soul
Sister likes to do it, Lord
Sister likes to move her soul

Sister's comin' home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
That done her wrong
Sister's coming home
Mama don't like the man that done her wrong
And the mirror's gonna tell her
How long she's been gone

Sister's comin' home

// Beneath Still Waters //

Beneath still waters
There's a strong undertow
The surface won't tell you
What the deep water knows
Darling, I'm saying
I know something's wrong
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone

Even a fool could see
That you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery

And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone

Even a fool could see
That you'll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery

And this time it's me
And I'll cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone

// Rough And Rocky //

Darlin' I have come to tell you
Tho' it almost breaks my heart
But before the mornin', darlin'
We'll be many miles apart

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep

Can't you hear the nightbird's cryin'
Far across the deep blue sea
While others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes think of me

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep

One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darlin', you have broke my heart

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep

// Hickory Wind //

In South Carolina
There are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree
That we used to climb
But it makes me feel better
Each time it begins
Callin' me home
Hickory Wind

I started out younger
At most everything
All the riches and pleasures
What else could life bring
But now when I'm lonesome
I always pretend
That I'm gettin' the feel of
Hickory Wind

It's a hard way to find out
That trouble is real
In a far away city
With a far away feel
But it makes me feel better
Each time it begins
Callin' me home
Hickory Wind
Keeps callin' me home
Hickory Wind

// Save The Last Dance For Me //

You can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me

You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You must tell her no

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin', save the last dance for me

// Sorrow In The Wind //

I hear the soft wind sighing
In every bush and tree
The sound of my heart crying
When you are far from me

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind

You leave me in the morning
Your footsteps die away
Tho' not a leaf is stirring
I hear the wind all day

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind

They say when love grows older
It dies and fades away
Yet all our life together
One ever brightening day

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind
Sweet sorrow in the wind

// They'll Never Take His Love From Me //

If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one whose smiling face the gods would see
'Cause he'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh, they'll never take his love from me
Well, I thought I'd make him happy if I stepped aside
But I knew his love would never set me free
And even on the day he took another to be his bride
I said they'll never take his love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold him now in fond caress
But they'll never, never take his love from me

What a fool I was to go break the trust he gave
And to see his love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh, they'll never, ever take his love from me

// Everytime You Leave //

Everytime you leave
You tear the soul from me
I die a little more each time part
I can't control my dreams
My heart can't seem to learn
To turn and lock its door when you return

I know that you'll come back again
As soon as you get blue
And I know what will happen then
One kiss and I'll give one to you

Everytime You leave
You tear the soul from me
But I want to live so I'll forgive
Everytime you leave

// Blue Kentucky Girl //

You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those neon lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

// Even Cowgirls Get The Blues //

She's a rounder I can tell you that
She can sing 'em all night, too
She'll raise hell about the slep she lost
But even cowgirls get the blues

Especially cowgirls, they're the gypsy kind
And need their laid on 'em loose
She's lived to see the world turned upside down
Hitchin' rides out of the blues

But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone
The only way she's ever been

Lonely nights are out there on the road
Motel ceiling stares you down
There must be safer ways to pay your dues
But even cowgirls get the blues

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone
The only way she's ever been

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin' like the restless wind
The only way she's ever been

// Cheatin' Is //

Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it really is
And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And break it into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is the part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for
A stranger here, a stranger there
Then you turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more
And lying at night when you're holding him tight
Is something that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mommy and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
But the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

// I Know An Ending When It Comes //

I never thought that you'd be leavin' me
And even now it's so hard to believe
But even the blind at times can see the sun
And at least I know an ending when it comes

I may have missed a lot of things you said
I know most of them went right overhead
But with all my heart I know this song's been sung
And at least I know an ending when it comes

How long ago did you start leavin' me?
How long have I lived with a memory?
I may have missed it when you first begun
But at least I know an ending when it comes

Yes, even the blind at times can see the sun
And at least I know an ending when it comes
