// I Don't Have To Crawl //

When you look at me
Like you don't know me
And you talk to me
Like you've never met me

I can leave you alone  if i try
If I tried I could tell you goodbye

If I wanted to
I could be long gone
And I don't have to crawl

Then you call on me
As if I should run to you
You make your move
as if I should follow you

Well I don't have to be nobody's fool
I won't make no exception of you
I don't have to be nobody's fool
I don't  make no exception of you

I don't have to crawl
I can just walk away
No I don't have to crawl

I don't have to get down on my knees

I don't have to crawl
I can just walk away
No I don't have to crawl

// How High The Moon //

Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon
There is no moon above and love is far away too
'Till it comes true
That you love me and I love you

Somewhere there's music, how near how far
Somewhere there's heaven, that's where you are
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart, how high the moon

Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart, how high the moon

The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart, how high the moon

// Spanish Johnny //

Those other years, the dusty years
We drove the big herds through
I tried to forget the miles we rode
And Spanish Johnny too
He'd sit beside a water ditch when all this herd was in
And he'd never harm a child but sing to his mandolin

The old talk, the old ways, and the dealin' of our game
But Spanish Johnny never spoke, but sing a song of Spain
And his talk with men was vicious talk
When he was drunk on gin
Ah, but those were golden things he said to his mandolin

We had to stand, we tried to judge, we had to stop him then
For the hand so gentle to a child had killed so many men
He died a hard death long ago before the road come in
And the night before he swung he sung to his mandolin

Well, we carried him out in the mornin' sun
A man that done no good
And we lowered him down in the cold clay
Stuck in a cross of wood
And a letter we wrote to his kinfolk
To tell them where he'd been
And we shipped it out to Mexico, along with his mandolin

// Bad Moon Rising //

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lighting
I see bad times today

Now don't go 'round tonight
For it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is comin' soon
I fear the river's overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

I hope you have got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

// Hot Burrito #2 //

Yes, you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes, you know how I feel
So it goes
It just couldn't be real
And we know it's wrong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
I've been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight

But you better love
Find some love
You better love me, Jesus Christ

Yes, you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you, baby, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
I guess you know how I feel
So it goes
Yes, it couldn't be real

And you want me home all night
You just don't want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
Love me baby, Jesus Christ

// Millworker //

Now my grandfather was a sailor,
He blew in off the water
My father was a farmer
I, his only daughter,
Took up with a no-good millworking man from Massachusetts
Who dies from too much whiskey
And leaves me these three faces to feed

Millwork ain't easy; mill-work ain't hard
Millwork, it ain't nothing but an awful boring job
I'm waiting for a day dream
To take me through the morning
And put me in my coffee break
Where I can have a sandwich and remember

Then it's me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life

Now my mind begins to wander
To the days back on the farm
I can see my father smiling at me,
Swingin' on his arm
I can hear my grand-dad's stories
Of the storms out on Lake Erie
Where vessels and cargos and fortunes
And sailor's lives were lost

Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,
And I have been the fool
To let this manufacture use my body for a tool.
I can ride home in the evening,
Staring at my hands
Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl
Ought to stand a better chance

So may I work the mills
Just as long as I am able
And never meet the man whose
Name is on the label

It be me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life

// Oh Atlanta //

Well, there's a place down Kentucky
Said right down near Ohio
You can watch the planes at night
People line up to watch each flight

I said a-watchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight

Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you

You can drop me off on Peachtree
I got to feel that Georgia sun
And the people in Atlanta
They make you awful glad you come

I said a-watchin' them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight

Oh Atlanta, Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you

We'll go down, just you and me
Where the music plays all night
They've got the boogie band playin' that's bound for hell
When they get to movin' they never stop

They just keep on playin' that down home beat
(Keep on layin' down harmony)
Yeah I wish I was on one
Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight

// Mister Sandman //

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream

// Ashes By Now //

This morning is Monday where are you now
Teasin' my memory  teaching me how to lay low
When I don't want to
Well love is elusive this I know now
It's making me crazy leaving me out
In the open  when I don't want to

The moments of pleasures Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now

The second street beggars alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am They're just like I am

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire  you're running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now

Just like a wild fire You're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by now
