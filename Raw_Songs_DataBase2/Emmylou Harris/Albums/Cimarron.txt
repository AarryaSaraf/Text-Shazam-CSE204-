Album: Cimarron

// Rose Of Cimarron //

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show
Can you hear them calling?
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark that never see a spark burn bright

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Trails that brought them home echo names the've known
Four days high and lonely comin' to you only
You're the one they'd turn to, the only one they knew who'd do
All her best to be around when the chips were down

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

// Spanish Is A Loving Tongue //

Spanish is a  loving tongue
Soft as music light as spray
Was a girl he learned it from
Living down Sonora way
He don't look much like a lover
But he says her love words over
Mostly when he's all alone
Mi amor mi corazon
On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers
How those hours would get to flyin'
All too soon he'd hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone
Mi amor mi corazon
He ain't  seen her since that night
He can't cross the line you know
They want him for a gambling flight
Like as not it's better so
Yet he's always sort of missed her
Since that last sad night he kissed her
Lost his heart left her own
Adios  mi corazon
Lost his heart left her own
Adios  mi corazon

// Another Lonesome Morning //

Another lonesome morning
Another long lonesome day
You'll have to live without him
The morning seemed to say
Another lonesome morning
You thought you didn't care
But morning breezes find   you
Wishing he were there

Bobwhite sings his same old song
Trying hard to please
And you hear the sound
That he used to love
Thru the rustlin' of the leaves
Thru the rustlin' of the leaves

You  losing him has taught you
That you  wanted him to stay
And you know that all another lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
All another lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
Is another lonesome day

// The Last Cheater's Waltz //

She was going to pieces when he walked in the door
She had to see him she can't wait no more
Tonight she'll be with him no matter the cost
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz

And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh   three quarter only
See how he holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz

He tells her he loves her as the music plays on
He tells he loves her but someone's at home
The ball game's all over and she knows she's lost
As the band plays   The Last Cheater's Waltz

And oooooooohh don't they play lonely
Oooooooohh don't they play sad
Oooooooohh  three quarter only
See how he  holds her
As the band plays The Last Cheater's Waltz

// Born To Run //

Well I never did crawl and I never did toe that line
No man is a master to me I ain't that kind
I just put on my traveling shoes
If you wanna win you just can't lose the time
Or stay behind

Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run

Well I take the chances sometimes I've made mistakes
But you don't get nothing unless you take the breaks
Living as dangerous as dynamite
Sure makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel alright
Makes you feel alright

Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run

Nobody's gonna make me do things their way
By the time you figure it out it's yesterday
Well it comes to he who waits I'm told
But I don't need it when I'm old and gray
Yea I want it today

Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run

// The Price You Pay //

You make up your mind,  you choose the chance you take
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
Out on through an open road you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay

Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
And then with their last breath
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths
Driving on through the night unable to  break away
From the restless pull of the price you pay

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay

Now they've come so far and they've waited so long
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day
And you gotta stand and fight for the price you pay

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay

Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the Promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the Chosen Land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay

So let the games start
You better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line
A stranger  passin' through put up a sign
That counts so many fallen away
To the price you pay,

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay

Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
Now you can't walk away from the price you pay

// Son Of A Rotten Gambler //

And his love will be his vision
And he'll take you where you stand
And will you stand your life by his
And help the boy become a man

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Will the devil be getting to you as you look back
Over what you've done
And what you've done was it for reason or rhyme
Was it just for fun

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teachin' love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Back on the road now you can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road now and you've made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you shine upon you

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Back on the road now you can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road now and you've made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you shine upon you

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
or the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

// Tennessee Waltz //

I was dancin' with my darlin to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see.
I introduced him to my darlin' and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

Now I wonder how a dance like the Tennessee Waltz
Could have broken my heart so complete
Well I couldn't blame my darlin', and who could help fallin'
In love with my darlin' so sweet

Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz
Wish I'd known just how much it would cost
But I didn't see it comin', it's all over but the cryin'
Blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz

She goes dancin' with the darkness to the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink and it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

// Tennessee Rose //

Well it's a  sweet dream
That keeps me close to you dear
And it's a sad thing
That we're apart I'm blue dear
And there are times now
I thank the heavens up above

When I'm with the one that I love
Now there are diamonds
That some may long to  see
And they may shine
But not bright enough for me
I wouldn't take no

The whole world dipped in gold
For a night with my Tennessee Rose
Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine

Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Well it's a  sweet dream
That keeps me close to you dear

And it's a sad thing
That we're apart I'm blue dear
And there are times now
That heaven only knows
How I love my Tennessee Rose
Only my Tennessee Rose
