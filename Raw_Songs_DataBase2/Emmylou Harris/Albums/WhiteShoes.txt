// Drivin' Wheel //

Well, all I want is a love that's hot
Can't be sold, can't be bought
Yeah, love that don't try to be somethin' it's not

Well, all I need is a love that's real
None can rob and none can steal
Hey, love that moves like a drivin' wheel

Well, all I want is drivin' wheel
All I want is a drivin' wheel
All 'round love my ideal

Well, all I want is love that's right
To hold onto with all my might
Hey, early in the mornin' and late at night

Well, all I want is drivin' wheel
All I want is a drivin' wheel
Hey, all 'round love my ideal

All I want is a drivin' wheel
All I want is a drivin' wheel
Hey, all 'round love my ideal

All I want is a drivin' wheel
All I want is a drivin' wheel
Well, all 'round love my ideal

Always and forever
I'll love just you

Just promise me darlin'
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear

Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal

My heart's at your command dear
To keep, love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal

I'll forever love you
The rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving ways

Just promise me darlin'
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn

// In My Dreams //

When the sun goes down on the other side of town tonight
And the world is asleep dreamin' in the deep moonlight
I'll slip away in the shadows out of your life
You don't want' me anymore so I'll close the door when I leave
My bags are packed and I'll give you back your keys
You keep your ring and I'll keep your memory

But in my dreams at night... oh...oh
Everything will work out right
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams

Well, it's hard to take when love breaks down and dies
But it's better to quit than to sit each nite and cry
I'd rather know the truth than to live thru a life of lies

But in my dreams at night... oh...oh
Everything will work out right
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams

Maybe it's for the best to give this love of ours a rest
But I'll come runnin' back if you want me
Well, bye bye baby it seems that we're all thru
You sure know how make this little girl blue
When you say you don't want the things I can do for you

But in my dreams at night... oh...oh
Everything will work out right
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams

In my dreams at night... oh...oh
Everything will work out right
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams

// White Shoes //

I want 'em, I need 'em
And I'm gonna go out and get 'em
White shoes

I know I'll feel better
When I slide down into the leather
White shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

I woke up from a dream
When I saw 'em in a magazine
White shoes

I said Lou you gotta start new
And the first thing you gotta do
Is get some white shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

You know he left me with the lonesome blues
Been hangin' 'round too long with nothin' to do
Yeah, he really made me pay those dues
But I'm goin' out on the town tonight in
White shoes

Well, I wanted 'em, I needed 'em
Yeah, and I went out and got 'em
White shoes
That new boy when I see him
I'm gonna walk right up and meet him in
White shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

White shoes
I'm goin' out on the town tonight

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

// On The Radio //

Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must've fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Oh, I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I'd been feeling over you
But they said it really loud and said it on the air
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...

Now don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming home real soon

Oh... he kinda a made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it for yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really mean
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...

Now if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
He found he really lied he said he really lied
On the radio

Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...

// It's Only Rock 'N' Roll //

Well, it's only rock and roll keep you running from yourself
When the only way to slow down is to fall
And it's only rock and roll that caused you to leave home
When the only way to get back is to crawl

But the record people love you they can get you on the bill
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill
People all around you everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you son it's only rock and roll

Yes and it's only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time
When you really ought to sit this one out
And it's only rock and roll keep on messin' with your mind when
You don't know what they're talkin' about

All around the world everywhere you go
People got to have it 'cause it's only rock and roll

It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll
People all around you everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll

Well it's only rock and roll when your money's in the mail
And your love's on the back of the bus
And it's only rock and roll when your records start to sell
And you don't know why they're making such a fuss

Telephone receiver ringin' off the wall
Can I get witness each and every call
Second that emotion chased into your soul
Don't worry lest you linger, son it's only rock and roll

It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll
People all around you everywhere you go
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll

It's only rock and roll. yeah it's only rock and roll
All around the world everywhere you go
People got to have it son it's only rock and roll

// Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend //

A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat or help you at the automat

Men grow cold as girls grow old
We all lose our charm in the end
But square cut or pear shape
These rocks don't lose their shape

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Yeah diamonds are a girl's best friend
Let's rock

There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
There may come a time when a hardboiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice, but get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those spouses
And diamonds are a girl's best friend

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Yeah diamonds are a girl's best friend
Let's rock  again

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

// Good News //

Darkness falls and you withdraw
Your humour disappears
It's been this way for years
It's nothing new
Come around and don't look down
You'll never see the sun
You'll never see the one
Who's loving you

You've got to hold your head up, darling
Never let them see
When you're sad, you look a lot like me

You've got to want to win my darling
Or you're bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news

Now I don't care for sad affairs,
The outcome's up to you
If tears are overdue, then let them fall...

Come around and don't look down
You'll never see the sun
You'll never see the one
Who's loving you

You've got to hold your head up, darling
Never let them see
When you're sad, you look a lot like me

You've got to want to win my darling
Or you're bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news

You've got to want to win my darling
Or you're bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news

Good news

// Baby Better Start Turnin' 'Em Down //

In this modern world we're livin'
The rules ain't like they've ever been
Speakin' of spreading it thin
That's what you do, flashing your soul
That ain't no way to treat your lover
Ain't no way to act with feelings
Baby, better start turnin' em down

Now it's a brave new wave we're roarin' in
Hanging out, out on the rock 'n roll fringe
Speaking of running around
All over town, lettin' it show
That ain't no way to treat your lover
Ain't no way to act in public
Baby, don't better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down

Sure is clear ain't nothin' easy any more
Sure gets cloudy when I look in all directions
Sure is rainin' like this feeling in my heart
Sure is crazy how you're acting

In this latest craze or current trend
Burnin' money every way that you can
Speakin' of goin' for broke
That's how it is and lettin' it slow
That ain't no way to treat your lover
Ain't no way to act with strangers
Baby, you'd better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down

Baby, better start turnin'
Baby, better start turnin' 'em down
Baby, better start turnin'

// Like An Old Fashioned Waltz //

Roses are red
Violets are blue
Primrose is pale
On the velvet green hue
Warm summer days
Like cool water falls
Like music we hear
Those things we'll always hold dear
Like an old fashioned waltz

When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world
And the heroine waits
For her love to return
And the violins play
From behind garden walls
Oh how I love to remain
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz

And they dance 'round the floor
And there's no one else there
In the world is no worry
And is never a care
By the perfect moon
As the nightingale calls
With only the moon
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz
