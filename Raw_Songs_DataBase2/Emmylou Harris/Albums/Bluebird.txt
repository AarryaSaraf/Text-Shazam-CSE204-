// Heaven Only Knows //

Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows

I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows

I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well, I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows

// You Been On My Mind //

Guess it's time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any other day cause you've been on my mind
It really hasn't been that long but it's funny where the time has flown
Old memories just keep holding on and you been on my mind

You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
I've seen a world baby without you
But I don't see myself there too

Hardly does a day go by when I don't see your clear blue eyes
Many night I just wonder why and you been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I've been thinking that something was wrong
I've told myself I should forget
But I don't seem to have it yet
I don't dream that you might change I don't think that I'm acting strange
I tell myself it's all in vain and you been on my mind

You've been on my mind I've said
Till it's all that's in my head
Yes I know what I must do
But I don't think you'll be there too

Guess it's time for me to go but as it is I'll never know
Just what it is that I long for so And you been on my mind

You been on my mind

// Icy Blue Heart //

She came on to him like a slow moving cold front
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye
She sat on the stool, and she said "What do you want
She said Give me a love that don't freeze up inside
He said, I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you  Lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I   had what it takes
To melt your icy blue heart

Should I start  to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool calm and collected
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze
But under the frost, wee thought he detected
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss
And there's  not enough heat in the fires burning there
To melt your icy blue heart

Should I start  to turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
To melt your icy blue heart

// Love Is //

Love is a shiny car
Love is a steel guitar
Love is a battle scar
Love is a morning song
Love is a twelve-bar blues
Love is your blue suede shoes
Love is a heart abused
Love is a mind confused

And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Love is a mine of gold
Love is a man to hold
Love is a drowning soul
Love is it's own reward

And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Oh, my love cross the double line
Oh, my love cross the double line

// No Regrets //

I know your leaving is  too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
Thru dry eyes I watched your plane
Fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets    no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke your name
Not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away
Just behind the darkest hour just before dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain

// Lonely Street //

I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street

Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street

// Heartbreak Hill //

Long long time ago when we were young
You swore to me I would be the one
I would be the one you loved
But we had to part
You asked me to wait for you
To keep you in my heart
To keep you in my heart

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill

Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long
Have you found another love
Am I still the one
Am I still the one for you
But you're far away
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday
Back to me someday

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill

On Heartbreak Hill alone at night
I think of how you held  me tight
And wonder if I ever will see you again
On Heartbreak Hill

Oh Lord if I only could go back in time enough
I'd hold you in my arms again
Never let you go
Never let you go my love
And leave me far behind
High upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine
You swore to be mine

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill
Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill
Here on Heartbreak Hill
Here on Heartbreak Hill

// I Still Miss Someone //

At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out to wild the parties
And look for a little fun
But I find the darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

Though I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry for
For leaving what we had begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

Though I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry for
For leaving what we had begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

// A River For Him //

I crossed on the river
There'll be no returning
I crossed all the bridges
I watched them all burning
And now I'm a stranger
To a strange land I'm driven
Where all is forgotten
And nothing's forgiven

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

I think of him now
On the road I am taking
And wonder how long
His heart will be breaking
But he'll never hear when
The teardrops are falling
Or the sound of my voice
And the name I'm calling

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

So weep for the sons
And the dear darling daughters
For the passing of time
And the parting of waters
For all who have passed through
This world long before me
To a far distant shore line
Where no one waits for me
But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

// If You Were A Bluebird //

If you were a bluebird you'd be a sad one
I'd give you a true word
But you've already had one
If you were a bluebird,
you'd be crying
You'd be flying home
If you were a raindrop,
You'd shine like a rainbow
And if you were a train stop,
The conductor would sing low
If you were a raindrop,
You'd be falling
You'd be calling home

If you were a hotel
Honey, you'd be a grand one
But, if you hit a slow spell,
Do you think you could stand one
If you were a hotel,
Well I'd lean on your doorbell
I'd call you my home
If I was a highway,
I'd stretch alongside you
I'd help you pass by ways
That had dissatisfied you
If I was a highway,
Well I'd be stretchin'
I'd be fetchin' you home
