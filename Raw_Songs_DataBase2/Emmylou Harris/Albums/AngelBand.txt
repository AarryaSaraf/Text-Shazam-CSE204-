// Where Could I Go But To The Lord //

Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Neighbors are fun I love a_?em everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from God's own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go to the Lord

// Angel Band //

My latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph has begun
Oh, come Angel Band come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home

Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory
Oh, come Angel Band come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home

// If I Be Lifted Up //

Down in the valley  while on my knees
I asked my Jesus carry please
He promised that he'd take care of me
If I would lift him up

He said if I
Be lifted up
He said if I
Be lifted up
I 'll be your father
I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister
And your brother

He said if I
Be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy
To your soul

When I am lonely
When I am sad
My Jesus comes and makes me glad
He is the dearest friend I've have had
I want to lift Him up

He said if I
Be lifted up
He said if I
Be lifted up
I 'll be your father
I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister
And your brother

He said if I
Be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy
To your soul

// Precious Memories //

As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home's scenes of my childhood
Infond memories appears

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

// Bright Morning Stars //

Bright morning stars are rising,
Bright morning stars are rising,
Bright morning stars are rising,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

Oh, where are our dear mothers,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

They are down in the valley praying,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

Oh where are our dear fathers,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

They have gone to heaven shouting,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

Bright morning stars are rising,
Day is a-breaking in my soul.

// When He Calls //

When darkness fills the valley
Fear and dread strive deep within us
But our burdens soon will be lifted
When these old homes turn to dust

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly peril
For He will carry me Home

Now Satan will come to tempt me
But I'll try to resist sinful ways
And I pray that I'll find salvation
In that peaceful Home far away

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly perils
For He will carry  Home

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly peril
He will carry me Home

// We Shall Rise //

In that Resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
Then the saints will come rejoicing and
no tears will e'er be found
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise (amen)
We shall rise, (hallelujah)
In that Resurrection morning
when these prison bars are broken
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

In that Resurrection morning
when the shades of life has fled
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
In the day of glory dawning when the sea
gives up His dead
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

I shall see my blessed Savior
who so freely died for me
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
And our fathers and our mothers and our
loved ones we shall see
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

// Drifting Too Far From The Shore //

Out on the perilous deep,
where danger silently creeps,
and storm's so violently sweeping,
You're drifting too far from shore.

Drifting too far from shore,
You're drifting too far from shore,
Come to Jesus today,
Let Him show you the way.
You're drifting too far from shore,

Today, the Tempest rose high,
and clouds o'ershadow the sky.
Sure death is hovering nigh,
You're drifting too far from shore.

Drifting too far from shore,
You're drifting too far from shore,
Come to Jesus today,
Let Him show you the way.
You're drifting too far from shore,

Why meet a terrible fate?
Mercies abundantly wait.
Turn back before it's too late
You're drifting too far from shore.

Drifting too far from shore
You're drifting too far from shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today. Let him show you the way
You're drifting too far from shore.

// Who Will Sing For Me //

I often sing, for those I love
Who go to live, with Christ above
No more on earth, their forms I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me

'Til I too, must say goodbye
Just over there, with Christ I'll be
Get all my friends, to sing for me

Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
As I so oft, for friends have done
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me

// Someday My Ship Will Sail //

Life is just a passing moment
On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a heart
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

There's eternity before me
Just beyond the dark'ning veil
O my spirit hollers to go on
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
Someday I'll be satisfied

// The Other Side Of Life //

Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now

All my days of sorrow
And tears for my loved ones
I wish I could tell them the door that I feel
Though my body is weary
My soul is uplifted
My sins are forgiven and my Jesus is real

Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now

Though my eyes are dim
I see Heaven clearly
Though my voice grows feeble I sing just the same
In my heart there's a song
As I see the gates open
I'll sing forever my joyous refrain

Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now
Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now

// When They Ring Those Golden Bells //

There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by faith, you see
Yes I want to see my Jesus
Shake His hand and have Him greet us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells a-ringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

When our days have known their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the Kingdom mends the spirit to be free
There'll be no more stormy weather
We'll live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells a-ringin'
Can't you hear the angels singin'
It's a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
