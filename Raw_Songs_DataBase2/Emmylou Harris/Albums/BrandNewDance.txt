// Wheels Of Love //

The wheels of love turn around and around
Keep on rollin' 'til you've found
The perfect partner, somebody just right
To have and hold every day and every night
So she's halfway to Texas with all of your dreams
The world ain't as bad as what it might seem
You got a whole lot of living, honey, left to do
There's still a whole lot of love inside of you

The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love to left be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love

Catch you a ride, imagine what you might find
Just the right girl at just the right time
Ready and waiting, she'll look you in the eyes
Ah, but the wheels of love will never compromise
So she broke your heart, honey don't look back
You got to keep on rollin' down the track
And maybe the next time you'll keep your feet on the ground
When the wheels of love spin you around

The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love

The wheels of love turn around and around
They'll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Don't let the heartache hold you down
When there's plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels, ridin' on the wheels of love

Oh, the wheels
Ridin' on the wheels of love

// Tougher Than The Rest //

Well it's saturday night
You're all dressed up and blue
I've been watchin' you go out
Maybe you been watchin' me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're lookin' for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arms some girls want
A sweet talkin' Romeo
We'll 'round here baby
I've learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Yeah, the road is dark
And it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you anytime
Maybe your other girlfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well, I don't know, baby
Maybe you've been around too
But there's another dance, baby
All you got to do is say yes
And if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

// In His World //

Every night I dream about him
In my world of fantasy
I pretend that we're together
In his world there's a garden in the moonlight
In his world there's a sweet and gentle breeze
In his world, oh he tells me that he loves me
That's where my heart wants to be

I saw a star falls from the heaven
I hope the wish I made comes true
I don't want to live without him
In his world I can see a new tomorrow
In his world where he gives his heart to me
In his world we will share this love together
That's where my heart wants to be

Why must I go on pretending
Why can't I tell him how I feel
These sweet dreams are never ending
And this loneliness is real

I saw a star fall from the heavens
I hope the wish I made comes true
I don't want to live without him
In his world I can see a new tomorrow
In his world where he gives his heart to me
In his world we will share this love together
That's where my heart wants to be

In his world there's a garden in the moonlight
In his world there's a sweet and gentle breeze
In his world, oh he tells me that he loves me
That's where my heart wants to be

// Sweet Dreams Of You //

Lonely tears roll down
As midnight comes around
But I can make it trough
In sweet dreams of you

In the shadow of the night
I still hold you tight
Did, it all comes true
In sweet dreams of you

In sweet dreams I see
The way thing you to be
When your love was thide
And your heart was true
In sweet dreams of you

Oh, I call out your made
And you come to me again
The way you used to do
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you

// Easy For You To Say //

These things happen
Love never comes with a guarantee
No hard meetings
But it looks like this love was never meant to be

That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say

There'll be changes
Times never been known to ever stand still
Lonely losers
Hold to a promise they'll never fulfill

That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say

You tell me you know hat it's wrong
To walk out this way
But in time my true love will come
And I'll thank you some day

That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
That's easy for you to say

// Rollin' And Ramblin' //

Folks in Nashville slammed the door
Said we don't want you anymore
Find your own way down the road
Pack your fiddle and your guitar
Take a train or take a car
Find someone else to keep you from the cold

Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride

Oh, he always sang the blues
Like it was all he ever knew
He didn't sing at all that night
He was pale and as he dozed
He didn't know his time had closed
Slumped in the back seat to the right

Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride

So they send him on night train South
Through the cities and the rural routes
Just one more place to go
Ah, the whistle sang the bluest note
Like it came from his own throat
Moanin' sad and cryin' low

Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'

The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride

Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride

// Better Off Without You //

Room 16, the Palms Motel
Now I can rest behind that door
My life with you's become a living hell
Don't wanna live like that no more
And whatever it will take
I will do to make this final break

Yeah, better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my life

So I'll unpack my bag
And kick off these old shoes
This room is a good as anyplace I've ever been
For lookin' at the truth
Now it's all so clear to me
What a blind man could plainly see

Yeah, better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my life

Oh, God, here comes the tears
I'm gonna stay right here
I'll cry. I've cried before
But I won't go back no more

Looks like a change in the weather
I can hear it start to rain
I hope it's not too long this time
Before the sun comes out again
But if it rains forever
I will still be better off

Yeah, better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my life

// Never Be Anyone Else But You //

There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

If I could take my pick of all
The boys I've ever known
Then I'd come and pick you out
To be my very own

There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

A heart that's true and longs for you
Is all I have to give
All my love belongs to you
As long as I may live

There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

I never will forget the way you kissed me
And when we're not together
I wonder if you miss me

For I hope and pray the day will come
When you belong to me
Then I'm gonna prove to you
How true my love can be

There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you

// Brand New Dance //

Darlin' you're tired
I can see in your eyes
I know how you feel
We've been together
Too long to conceal
What's in our hearts
Maybe we should part
But after so many years
That would only bring loneliness
Sorrow and tears
And anyway...

I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends

There will always be days
When it don't seem to pay
When it just  doesn't rhyme
Well, that's bound to happen
Some of the time
Our best days aren't gone
We don't need to move on
Well, maybe we should try
But I don't think you could take it
And neither could I
And anyway...

I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends

Darlin' come here
Love's not disappeared
You're just feelin' low
Well, let me tell you my darlin'
That's a feelin' I know
It don't mean too much
We just got out of touch
Well, it's easy to change
'Cause lovin' you's not too hard to arrange
And anyway...

I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again
We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends

We'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Yes, we'll start a brand new dance
Between old friends

// Red Red Rose //

You may wonder if you know me
You may wonder if I care
Or if I'll leave you sad and lonely
Or if I'll always be right there
Well there's no need for doubt now darlin'
'Cause I have come to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose

And you may wonder about this dreamer
If she's all you thought she'd be
And, oh, if anything but someday
Ever comes from lovin' me
But hold me close and tell me darlin'
That you have come to know
This love I bring you is no common thing
You know this love is like a red, red rose

When you're all caught up in sweet surrender
Simple truth is sometimes hard to see
Here between the tough times and the tender
It all comes down to you and me

And you may see my heart of darkness
I may stumble now and again
But underneath this heart of darkness
There's a heart that's lovin' you right till the end
So hold me close, come hold me darlin'
'Cause I want you to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose

This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose
