Alright...hmm...alright...hooo

A rose is a beautiful flower. 
To me the prettiest in the world. 
And that goes double, double for a girl cause she's like no other flower in the world. 
Remember, they're not perfect you see. So you got to take the bitter with the sweet. 
And remember fellas: he who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears. (yeah, yeah, yeah). 
Talking about the good and the bad in a woman.

A rose remains so pretty if you treat it with loving care (yeah yeah yeah)
And that goes double double for a girl
Treat her right and her love she'll truly share 
But you've got to take the bitter with the sweet and return the lowly moments of despair. 
And remember fellas he who picks a rose must accept the thorns that's there...yeah yeah yeah yeah

Talking 'bout the good and bad in a woman...

I tell ya, tell ya...that a rose remains the same if you handle it with care (yeah yeah yeah) 
And now that goes double double for a girl; 
Treat her right and she'll stand besides you anywhere
I know sometimes they get carried away, say some things they don't mean to say. 
Just remember fellas: he who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears...yeah

Talking bout the good and bad in a woman
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)

Gotta remember when you choose your lover
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)

The day you take one, you've got to take the other
(He who picks a rose must accept the thorns it bears)
