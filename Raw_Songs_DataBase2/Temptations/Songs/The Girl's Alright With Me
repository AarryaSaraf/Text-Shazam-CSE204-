This little girl of mine
I wanna say shes so fine
And each and every day
I'll make sure she has her now
We don't feel tied down
Allthough are hearts are bound
I don't have to chsae her all over town
My baby shes all ways around


The girls allright with me
You know the girls allright 

Now shes so good to me
I guess thats why i feel fancy free
Just to see the glow in her eyes
Makes me once agian realize
I love her with all of my
And i know we'll never eva part
I never heard about or caught
Her playin i guess thats why
You allways hear me sayin'



When i visit at her home
Other fellas never never ring her phone
She lets them know just where they stand
She tells them all that i'm her man
And when we're out on a date
Other fellas wait till i walk away
They try to beat my time
She tells them in a nice way shes mine
All mine
