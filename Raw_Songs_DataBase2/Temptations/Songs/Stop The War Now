Knock on my door, it's a letter from the war
Saying, "Greetings, we want you"
If I refuse to fight they say that ain't right
And time you'll have to do
Somebody please tell me what is war all about?
Why must I kill against my will?
I just can't figure it out
Oh oh oh oh

Does anybody give a damn, yeah
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war (Right now)

Think about all the soldiers
That are dead and gone today
If you'd ask them to fight again
What do you think they'd say?
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm just trying to get a point across
War is world's enemy #1
And it's time that we called it off
Oh oh oh oh

Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, hey hey, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

More casualties pile up each day
Cemeteries are overflowing
The leaders of the world claim peace is near
But the death list keeps on growin'
And what does a mother get in return
For the life of the son she's lost?
A few measly pennies a month
A medal, a grave, and a doggone cost

Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, oh oh, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

(Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it, sing it, sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Everybody sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it to my brother, now
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Listen, listen, listen, listen (Woo))

The power and the glory
For ever and ever
Amen
Rest the souls
