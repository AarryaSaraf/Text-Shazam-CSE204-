What am I going to do

Since you went away
I ain't had nothing much to say, no
I been keeping to myself the reasons why you left
I walked around bewildered
Because she caught me in the wrong
There was nothing I could say
To keep her from leaving home

I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime

I know that I was wrong
Because you can't share love with two

I just took a chance
A chance on losing you
I lost my pride and joy because
I was careless with her heart
I didn't believe nothing could ever tear us apart

I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime baby

I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime
Oh I'll never find (oh never find)
Another love (never ever find)
In a lifetime, in a lifetime

It'll shake your world over
I ain't never found no loving like you do
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
I'll never find another love like yours in a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime baby
