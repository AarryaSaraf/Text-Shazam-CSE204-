The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
(Oh, yeah)
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
(Oh, yeah)
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

Next time I'll be kinder
(Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her?
(Won't you please help me find her?)

Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
(Of this love she left behind her)

Till I find her I'll be trying ta
(Till I find her I'll be trying ta)
Everyday I'm more inclined ta
Find her

Inclined ta
Find her
Inclined ta find my baby
Been looking everywhere
(Baby)
Baby, I really, really care

Oh, determination is fading fast
(Oh, yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past
(Oh, yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

I feel so bad
(Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad
(Since I lost my baby)

Everything is wrong
This heart is hard to carry on
(Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be
(Since I lost my baby)

What's gonna happen to me?
