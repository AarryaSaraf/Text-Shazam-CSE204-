I'm an Aries
And you're a Libra
We should be so incompatible (incompatible)
But each time you touch me I know that we're
An exception to the rule

You're folks and mine, oh they both agree
That you don't belong with me
But they can't live our lives for us
Only you and I can decide

Our future; our fate
Fate

Can we come and share in love
I just want to know girl, come on
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love

Odds are we will stay in love
Stay in love
Let us stay in love

Now I'm a man and you're a woman
That is all love needs to make it bloom
(Needs to make bloom)
So if we can deal with each other
I don't care what people may say
I don't care what they may say, no, no, no
Since the beginning of the history of man
Love and romance has always been
The important part of the master plan
Only you and I can decide
Our future; our fate
Fate

Can we come and share in love
People say that our love won't last
But the strong of the heart take the greater task
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
I just want to love you

Odds are we will stay in love
Yes we will; we're going to stay in love
Stay in love

Can we come and share in love
Can we share, can we share my baby
Love,love,love,love,let's share in love
Can't you hear me baby pleading

Odds are we will stay in love
Ooh, we're going to stay in love
Stay in love

Oh, come on baby
Let me talk to you just a moment
Just want to squeeze you
Because I know that it will please you

Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
Stay in love with you because you mean so much to me
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
Going to share my love with you girl
Because you mean so much to me
Love, love, love, love, let's share in love
