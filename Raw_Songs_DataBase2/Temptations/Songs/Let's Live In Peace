Where has all the love gone today
Have we no time to stop and pray
It's hard to believe in the man on the hill
Who can we trust and who will be for real

Let's come together and make a better place
Don't be afraid to lend a friend a hand
This old world we live in has got to make a change
It's plain to see that
Lord things just can't stay the same

All it takes is a little of your time
It's just a little of your time
Some of your time and the right frame of mind
It's up to you and me

We've got to live in peace
Let us live in peace
We've got to live in peace
Let us live in peace
Working together
Let us live

Is anybody listening to me
What about the children that are born new every day
They're innocent eyes look for the heart we throw away
Deep down inside can't you hear the children pray
Don't let the sun set on another wasted day

All it takes is a little of your time
It's just a little of your time
Some of your time and the right frame of mind
It's up to you and me

We've got to live in peace
Yes we do, yes we do
Let us live in peace
Work on it together
Helping one another
Let us live in peace
Let us live in peace
Let us live

Live, live, live, live
Let us live in peace
We've got live together, yes we do, yes we do, yes we do
(Let us live in peace)
We got to work with one another
(Let us live in peace)
We've got to get on up, get on up
And try to help somebody sometime
Everybody got to get on their knees sometime
And you got to pray
