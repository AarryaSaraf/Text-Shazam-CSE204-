I never knew any one woman's love
Could have such an effect on me
Reaches down in my heart (way down)
Fires up my soul
Brings out all the needs in me, ooh!

Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love

How did I ever underestimate
What the love of a woman can do
When, darling pound for pound
I admit I've found
All the best love in you, ooh!

Give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I'm coming back for more
So open your doors
Ooh baby
I've got an ever ready love, take it baby
Woo hoo baby
I got an ever ready love, just for you girl

(Ever ready love)
(Ever ready love)

Ooh, give it up baby, baby give it up
(I said baby give it up)
(I said baby give it up)
I got love on my mind, I need you by my side

I got an ever ready love, take it baby
Well, ooh ooh
I got an ever ready love, just for you girl
Baby, I got an ever ready love
