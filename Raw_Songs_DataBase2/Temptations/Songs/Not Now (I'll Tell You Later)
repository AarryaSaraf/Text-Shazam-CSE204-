Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, everybody sing now
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

When my dad thought I had become of age
He said, "Son, you're getting to the Lovin' Stage"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"It's time you stopped being all alone
You've got to find a girl you can call your own"

I said, "Not now, I'll tell you later
Not now, I'll tell you when
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

I met a little girl, fine as could be
I said, "There was a girl who was made for me"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss
So I asked the little girl for just one kiss

She said, "Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

When it's time for you to fall in love
It don't make sense for you to hurry
Take your time and make up your mind
'Cause the surer you are, the less you have to worry

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love (Everybody sing it)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
When I'm gonna fall in love (One more time, everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later...
