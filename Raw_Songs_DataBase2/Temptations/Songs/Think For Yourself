We're expecting miracles from the Whitehouse
Tell me how much can one man do
He's just trying to pull the world together
To make it better it's up to me and you

The first role of man
is self-revelation from god
Don't be led astray
You're leaning on somebody's job

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you
I wish you would (think for yourself)
Stop depending on someone else
Ooh, to do your (job for you)
Don't you let them (do your job for you)
Well

Think
You got to (think)

Keeping up with the pace of the space age
Inventors drawing blueprints every day
Automation means conductive labor
Be prepared for whatever comes your way

Educate your mind
Because you've still got time to pursue
Any dream in mind
It's your life; it's all up to you

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you
Do your job for you

Think for yourself

Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you

Think
Stay in school
Think
Don't be a fool

Educate your mind
Because you've still got time to pursue
Any dream in mind
It's your life; it's all up to you

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do it yourself)
Oh your job for you
Do your job for you (come on, come on)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you
Oh your job for you (do your job, do your job)

Think
Stay in school
That's what I call being cool
Think
Get out that line
Stop wasting time

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
(Stop depending on someone else)
To do your job for you (do your job)
Oh your job for you (don't you let them)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do you job for you)
Oh your job for you (do your job for you)

Think
We've got to use our minds
I'm so tired of hearing the plea that I can't do this and
That ain't me
I don't want to hear
That's what I could've done; that's what I should've
Done; that's what I would've done
Think for yourself
Think (well, well)
Think (come on)
Stop and use your head
Think (we've got to work)
Think (got to use our minds)
Stop and use your head (got to stop wasting time)

Think for yourself
Stop depending on someone else
To do your job for you (do your job)
Oh your job for you (do your job)
