Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee, most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness, Little Miss Sweetness
Sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now

If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes, and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read
But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought, together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell ya, you're Little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world, and that's the truth, baby
Sweetest girl in the world now
Ah yeah...
Alright

Now listen to me you sweet thing, hear what I have to say
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay
But do one thing for me, don't go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you would surely melt away

You know you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Tryna tell you, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ooh-hoo, you're Little Miss Sweetness
Ah yeah, sweetest girl in the world
Sweetest girl in the world now
The sweetest girl in the world
