Love somebody sweet
Love somebody fine
Love somebody
Who won't leave you behind
That's what your mind says oh, oh
But that's a warning that you just can't heed
'Cause when you love somebody
No matter who and that's the one you need
Come on and
Love somebody strong
Don't love nobody weak
Don't love nobody wrong yeah
Don't love nobody meek

That's what your mind say oh, oh
But that's a warning that you just can't heed
'Cause when you love somebody
No matter who an a that's the one you need

Get someone faithful, baby
Get someone true
That's good advice
But the one I need is you

Need your loving baby
Need your love indeed
I, I need your loving baby
You're the one I need
