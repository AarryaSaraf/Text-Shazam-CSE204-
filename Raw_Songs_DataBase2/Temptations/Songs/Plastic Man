Well, he specializes in talking trash
Carries himself like the
World's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash

The clothes he wears
Are second to none
He's a jack of all trades
And a master of none

Agrees with everything
He knows nothing about
So he doesn't feel left out

Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing so he's got to
Keep up his front

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

He always borrows
Never lends
He says, you know me, man
I'm with him, let me in

Yes, he's willing to
Stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
He won't help you if he can
Plastic Man

Claim to fame, he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just
Another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five
And talking loud

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

I guess you know he does a
Little dipping and dabbing
In a gang, they go on
Backstabbing

You better stop your fantasizing
Start, boo boo boo boom
To realizing that black is black
And white is white
Wrong is wrong and right is right

Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man
Trying to get it over
Any way he can

Plastic Man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Trying to get it over
Any way he can
Plastic Man...
