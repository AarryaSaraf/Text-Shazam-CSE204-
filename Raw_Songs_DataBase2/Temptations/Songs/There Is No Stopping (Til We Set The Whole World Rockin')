Everybody gonna get on the floor
We're calling all the nations
By eastern army nation
Come join the party of the world

So we're gonna boggy back
We're out of the door
And on a piece
'Cuz there's no stopping
Till we set the whole world rockin'
Tonight

Just come on your way and fly
Everybody's just begun

Come on up and celebrate
People it's time to come

Till we set the whole world rockin'

We got sake from Japan
Come in and lend a hand
We got a beat for every groove

So if you want a hand
Just go grab yourself
To the biggest disco you've ever seen
