Baby, our love was strong yesterday
(Now you watch love fade away)
Happiness was ours to share
(Now you just don't seem to care)
Without the love that we once knew
My heart is weak, what can I do
Feel like the rain, I feel the pain of losing you

It's a tragedy, baby, that you do to me
Why did you leave me
It's a tragedy, honey, that you do to me
Why did you leave

Baby, everywhere I see your face
(Memories you can't erase)
The long lonely nights have begun
(And you've got no place to run)
Can't you see the way I feel
Black is black, the pain is real
I can't bear to see the dawn
'Cause you're gone

It's a tragedy, baby, that you do to me
Why did you leave
I can't feel a thing, baby
Why did you leave, why did you leave, baby
Why did you leave, honey
Why did you leave, baby, honey
It's a tragedy that you do to me

Why did you leave, baby
It's a tragedy that you do to me
Don't crush my world, baby
It's a tragedy that you do to me, honey
Don't crush my world, baby
You know I need you, honey

Don't leave me alone...
