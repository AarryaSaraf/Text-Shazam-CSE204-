Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do

Don't waste time foolish dreaming
Get your life into the main stream
Before the ... hits the fan
Life is real, it's a mother
Hold on strong
Don't let it throw ya

Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do

If the love in your life
Don't put life in your love
Everywhere
There's complications
Life is real, it's a mother
Hold on strong
Don't let it throw ya

Ride it Bare Back
Get up on it and ride
Ride it Bare Back
It's the natural thing to do
