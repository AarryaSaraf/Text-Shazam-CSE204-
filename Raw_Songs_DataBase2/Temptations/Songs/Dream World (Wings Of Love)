When morning comes and finds me
I'll be living in a dream
The sun will be shining
Everything smiling with me

Tonight I lay here in your arms
Beside your naked skin
Oh, what a feeling
Starting to flow out of me

Girl, we paint a pretty picture
In a pretty room
On a pretty bed
And the things you say!

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love
Oh baby, wings of love

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love

Inside your arms, close to your heart
That's where I want to stay
The pleasure you give me
Is more than these words I can say

All the world and all this gold
Can't buy this way I feel
A treasure forever
And diamonds don't sparkle like love

'Cause you gave to me a feeling
That has changed my life
That has changed my mind
When you gave me love, yeah!

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love
Oh baby, wings of love

It's like I'm living in a dream world, baby
Far away from the pains of reality
Moving gently through the twilight, lady
You've got me flying up high on wings of love

You've got me dreaming
You've got me dreaming
You've got me dreaming all the time
