When you're feeling alright, I never see you coming
But when you're hurt, you always come running
But one of these days I know, I'm gonna have to let you go

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to, baby?
Where you gonna hide?
I wanna know, who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

When you're going strong (going strong)
I don't see you at all (I don't see you at all)
But when something goes wrong (when something goes wrong)
That's when you call (that's when you call)
But if you keep doing me like you do
Then I'm gonna turn my back on you

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Now who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

When you climbed love's tree, you thought that love was a game
But now you're out on a limb, oh yes, and you're calling my name
But one of these days I'm bound, to let you come tumbling down

Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?
Baby, baby, who you gonna run to? Exactly where
Where you gonna hide?
