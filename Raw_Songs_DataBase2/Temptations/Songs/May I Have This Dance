May i have this dance
i've been waitin for this chance
all night long (all night long)
and this night i'll always treasure
if i could have the pleasure
to excort you
dont you know i've bit my nails in to
wantin to dance with you
but i was much too shy
i never had the nerve
before you'd dance across the floor with another guy
the way he held you in his arms
with his many charms
i knew my chances were slim
in order to get to you
there's only one thing to do
so i got rid of him
hey
ooh hoo i told him that a girl
by the name of pearl
was looking for him
and when i turned around
he was nowhere to be found
so here i am
ooh i gotta have this dance (gotta have this dance with you)
honey i (gotta have this dance with you)
honey i, honey i, honey i, have this dance
honey i (gotta have this dance with you)
gotta have this dance
oh...
