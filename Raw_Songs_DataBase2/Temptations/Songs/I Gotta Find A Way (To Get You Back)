Woo
Since you've been gone, girl.
Said that, I've been so all alone, girl.
You've got me afraid, afraid to close my eyes.
Each time I do it's you I visualize.

Baby, baby, I can see you walking away. (Walking away, girl)
Just like you did that day, girl. (Did that day, girl)
The same hurt that I felt when we parted.
Baby, baby, once again I started.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo, I gotta find a way. (...to get you back, girl)
Ooo (I'm so lonely)

Nights I can't sleep, girl.
I tell you without ya, I'm weak girl.
Listen, not one single day, day goes by.
Can I wake up without tear-filled eyes.

Listen, I'm very seldom leave my lonely room. (Leave my lonely room, girl) (?)
'Cause without ya my life is filled with gloom. (Filled with gloom, girl)
There is no inch of the tears that I shed.
Girl, I'm slowly going out of my head.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo, gotta get you back. (...to get you back, girl)
Oh yeah. (I'm so lonely)
I gotta get ya back, girl.

(Gotta find a way to get you back, oh baby.)
(Gotta find a way to get you back, oh baby.)

Ooo, girl, I, girl, girl, ooo
Now when I'm out walking.
Huh girl, I always wind up on your street.
Look it here, I'm just a broken hearted guy.
In a dark and lonely world.
In need of a love you took from me.

Baby, baby all I do is think about you, baby. (Thinking about you)
It's a cold, lonely world without you. (Cold world without you)
Girl, my heart ain't getting no stronger.
I just can't carry on very much longer.

So don't you know that I... (I gotta find a way...)
Ooo (...to get you back, girl)
Got to get you back.
I, I, I, I (I'm so lonely)

I gotta get you back. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Oh baby, baby (Oh, baby)
I gotta get you back. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Woo, look it here. (Oh, baby)

I got to find a way to get you back... (girl)
Woo (I'm so lonely)
I gotta find a way. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Oh baby, baby, baby (Oh, baby)

I gotta find a way. (I gotta find a way to get you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, baby)
I got to find a way to get you back... (girl)
Oh, ooo (I'm so lonely)
