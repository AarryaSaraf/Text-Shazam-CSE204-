The first love of your life wasn't true to you and it broke your little heart.
He loved you, then he left you, confused, misused and in the dark.
Won't you let me walk into your world of darkness and confusion?
Let me show you there's another side to love that's more than a sweet illusion.
If you just believe, just believe in love again.
You'll find there's two sides to love and what you experienced wasn't the real thing.
Cause true love is an emotion that can soothe your very soul.
It brings joy to a heart of sadness and warmth to a life grown cold.
Don't give it up. Don't hang your head down. Life can be beautiful.
Just open your heart, stretch out your arms. Let love work a miracle.
Though your dreams are shattered and torn, girl all your dreams can be reborn.
Cause it's never to late for your dream to come true. 
Just believe, just believe in a heart that's true.
You'll find there's two sides to love and all my love it's so true it  won't make you blue.
Cause true love won't bring troubles, it would bathe your troubles away.
It will ne're leave every dark cloud in the light and make room for a brighter day.
Two sides to love .
Let me show you the other side.
What you saw was the bad side.
Let me show you the real side.
Let me show you the true side
