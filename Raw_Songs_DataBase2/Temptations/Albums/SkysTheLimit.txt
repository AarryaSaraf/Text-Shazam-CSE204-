// Gonna Keep On Tryin' Till I Win Your Love //

Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I laid eyes on you
I know your love, your love belongs to someone else
But girl, I got to have you for myself (For myself)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love
Girl, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love

A fallen star (A fallen star) that's what you are, from the heavens above
Girl, no treasure on earth can match your worth
You're a picture of love
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy
But you're wrong
I love ya and I need you, by my side (By my side)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love
Girl, I'm gonna keep on trying, oh baby now, till I win your love

I can't help but envy the guy that's got you by his side
Lord, he's got everything
There's is no end to his happiness
Girl, to be in his place, I'd gladly give you anything, oh yes I would
I know your love belongs, belongs to him
But I could never be satisfied just being a friend (Being a friend)

So, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love
Oh girl, I'm gonna keep on trying till I win your love

// Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me) //

Oooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me"
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I've never met her but I can't forget her
(Just my imagination) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runnin' away with me, ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

She's never hard to find (Just my imagination)
She's always on my mind (Runnin' away with me)

// I'm The Exception To The Rule //

Each day you've got someone new
A new heart to break
And leave feeling blue

For you're a handsome guy
Girls just can't pass you by
But I can, my friend
I'm the exception to the rule

I know you think I'm just acting the part
Of the girl with the cold, cold heart
And it won't take long
For you to capture me
With your innocent but meaningful plea

But you won't capture me
I'm the exception to the rule

You tell me
Darling that's where you're wrong
That your love for me is oh so strong
That you will soon, very soon
Make me give in

I know that nine girls out of every ten
Wants you to be their man
But there I am again
That one in ten

So it's useless
For you to try and change me
Because I won't give in, my friend

You could fool all the girls
With your lies
About you being so sweet and kind

But oh no, not me
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up

I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up

I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
The exception to the rule
Give it up

I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
I'm the one you can't fool

// Smiling Faces Sometimes //

Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth uh
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
The truth is in the eyes
Cause the eyes don't lie, amen

Remember a smile is just
A frown turned upside down
My friend let me tell you
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, uh
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

Beware, beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
I'm telling you beware
Beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy)
Misery (misery)
Envy I tell you, you can't see behind smiling faces
Smiling faces sometimes they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
(Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes)
(Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes)

I'm telling you beware, beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
Listen to me now, beware
Beware of that pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Your enemy won't do you no harm
Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice I'm only try' to school ya

// Man //

Awakened by the daylight, man starts his busy day
Eight hours occupy his mind 'cause the bills gotta be paid
Will he take a moment and give thanks before he's on his way?
Everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray

Man has made everything, this we can't deny
Invisible highways in the sky so safely his iron bird can fly
Hooray for man for he has finally conquered the moon
But when asked when will the fighting end, he only answers...soon

Man won't rest until events are being had
When you think about it, it's really kinda sad
Man is no longer in need of a friend
With no love for his fellow man, this could only mean the end

// Throw A Farewell Kiss //

If there's someone else in this world you love more than me
I won't be selfish, girl, I'll just set you free
And when you're leaving, I won't cry, and I won't sigh
I'll say the words 'goodbye' and throw you a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

Remember, it doesn't take much to make a man cry when he's in love, oh yeah
So don't, don't let it you bother you when the tears start to fill my eyes, oh yeah
No, don't let my cryin' change your mind
Just tell me the words 'goodbye' and throw me a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

I know the grass looks greener, so much greener on the other side
But listen, you won't miss your water until your well runs dry

And when his love, his love for you grows old, yeah
And suddenly you find yourself left in the cold, yeah
You've got to be strong when things go wrong
Just tell him the words 'goodbye' and throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo
Somethin' that you won't miss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo
And throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss

// Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite The World) //

Sick minds, sad sights,
Never ending sleepless nights have been accepted as an everyday thing.
Wire tapping, kidnapping...

Will the Russians push the button?

I tell you, people, our thoughts and values have got to change.
They say love is the strongest force on this earth.
Uh, but to me, peace among people surpasses love and worth.
People (jobs don't come no bigger than the one we've got to do.)
If we don't give peace a chance, what do you think is gonna happen to me and you?

Think about it.

That's why I am reaching out my hand to be your friend.
This unrest between races has got to come to an end.
Don't let the color of my skin confuse you.
I swear on a stack of bibles I won't misuse you.
So put your (hand in mine.)
Huh, we're gonna form a human chain, mightier than a hurricane.

(And walk this land, hand in hand, day and night, black and white.)
We gotta unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it.

We got to unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Log on to kill this message.
Come on and sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it with me.

We got to unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
God almighty,. Sing it, sing it, sing it.
Aww, unite the world.

Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Awww.

Oh, ding-dong-ding let the freedom bell ring.
The good Lord made you and me, what he wanted us to be.
Free all those people you got chained up in your (mind.)
Hmmm-mm-hmmm, now there's truth in what I'm saying.
We gotta stop the games we're playing.
Two wrongs ain't never made a right (Right)

Hung up, tripped out, whatever you may be,
Now is the time to set yourself free.
Put your (hand in mine.) Huh, come on.
Oh, and let's walk.

Oh, we gonna...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Sing it with me now...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Raise your voices and sing along with me.

Come on, we gonna unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
We gonna...(walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)

We gonna unite the world.
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it.
Aw, come on, come on, come on, come on.

(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
(Walk this land, day and night, hand in hand, black and white.)
