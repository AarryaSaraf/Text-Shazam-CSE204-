// Glass House //

If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones (Watch out, watch out)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones

We're all made with 3 plays apiece...
We're born alone, and we die alone
Why can't we live in-between?

I don't care what goes on in your house when you close your door
If you quit lookin' in my bedroom window, I'll quit lookin' in yours

My Girl came home and she caught me with Alice
And she threw me out the door, nah, nah, nah

But the real reason that she was so mad
Was that she was with Alice before (Say what?!)
(See there? People always doin' that)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Yeah, y'all)
Don'tcha throw no stones (It's a shame)

If you're living in a glasshouse 
Don'tcha throw no stones

...I ain't no fool 

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...
Swapping

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...
Swapping

If you're living in a glasshouse 
You don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glasshouse
Don't throw no stones 

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...
Swapping

Sweet-talkin', Bar-hoppin', Pill-poppin', Wife-swappin'
Swapping... 
Swapping...
Swapping 

I said livin', I said livin'

If you're living in a glasshouse...

// Shakey Ground //

Lady luck and the four leaf clover
Won't be as hurt as I feel all over
My life for one special occasion
'Til you leave in depth the situation

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Able to throw me a life preserver
'Cos I'm about to drown in my own tears

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Shaking, shakey ground
Standing, standing
Standing on shakey ground

// The Prophet //

A man cried, "Where do we look?
What do we say? How do we find it?
A woman needs love, "My body needs love,
my soul needs love, how do I find it?"
We all need love, gotta have love.
Prophet! Prophet!

I dream of a prophet man from a far distant land… Ali!

They say that lord will call to you
to follow him, though it's hard to do.
Believe, believe! We gotta believe!

Within your heart is the secret of life,
with joy and sorrow, pleasure and strife.
Love is all of these things.

I dream of a prophet man from a far distant land… Ali!

A priestess said, "Tell us a prayer!"
A lawyer said, "Is law fair?"

Astronomers cried of galaxies and time.
A poet said, "Is there duty to find?"

To speak of god, speak of reason, 
Speak about death, speak about freedom! 
Gotta have truth, gotta have wisdom,
give us your word to give to our children!

I dream of a prophet man from a far distant land… Ali!

The clock struck twelve at the church of water.
Their voices beckoned to the prophet's call.

You give up yourself when you truly give;
possessions shouldn't rule the life you live.
Work with love and love your work;
and idle man is a stranger on earth.
Blame yourself for wrong deeds done;
the innocent can be the guilty ones.
Freedom disguises itself in chains;
happiness sometimes hides in pain.
Children are made and are born to you;
but they're not slaves that belong to you.
God doesn't listen to the words you pray;
he hears what your heart has got to say.

I dream of a prophet man from a far distant land… Ali!

// A Song For You //

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see
(baby can't you see now)

There's no one more important to me (baby)
Baby can't you please see through me 'cause we're alone now and
I'm singin' this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody)
cause my love's in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine (you are a friend of mine)
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and

I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and
I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and
I was singin' this song, singin' this song for you

// I'm A Bachelor //

I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice

Listen here...

I've been a lot of places in my lifetime
I've had a lot of women that I thought was mine - many times
There's not many things in life that I won't do - naw
But I'm still a lonely man, and I've got to tell you

That I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice

Well...

I really want a girl I can bring my money to - yes I do
And do all the things that the sweet thing wants me to - yeah
But I'm not rushing, I'm taking it one step at a time
Cause when I find that girl, she'll know that she's mine

Until I do, I'm a bachelor...It's not by choice - naw
I'm a bachelor - I've got to speak my voice
(I want bachelors all over the world to say it with me)
I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor)...It's not by choice - Say it again
I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor) - I've got to speak my voice - yeah

Don't want nobody to feel sorry for me - naw
I ain't askin' for no charity
Ain't got but one goal, just one goal in life
I wanna be happy, and find myself a wife

Until I do, I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor)...But not by choice - naw
(I'm) I'm a bachelor (I'm a bachelor) - I've got to speak my voice

Sometimes it makes me wanna...

Woo eww eww, (well) dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww, I can't help myself
Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww

I'm a bachelor

All of you married men
I envy you (yes I do, yes I do)
I wish I was married too - yes I do

All of you married men
I envy you (yes I do, yes I do)
I wish I was married too - yes I do

Heyyy

Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh
Woo eww eww, dih dih dih dihhh

// Firefly //

Firefly, Firefly
Shine your light tonight
Assist the Moon and Stars
In helping us
To ease our troubled minds

Firefly, Firefly
Golden night of serenity, yeah
show us the light naturally.
And maybe she wont worry
when there aint nothing I can do.

When sea runs dry
and the stars fall from the sky
She a vulnerable flower
and she believes in me

Even when I had to lie
I shouldn't have lie
To make the world feel alright
Firefly, Firefly

[Spoken]
Um,Um,Um, Sometimes I feel
I have the weight of the world
on my shoulders. But knowing the
strength she sees in me
I smile because she believes me.

Firefly, Firefly
Golden night of serenity
show me the light naturally.
And maybe she wont worry
when aint nothing I can do.

When sea runs dry
and the stars fall from the sky
She a vulnerable flower
and she believes in me

Even when I had to lie
I shouldn't have lie
To make the world feel alright
Firefly, Firefly

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Firefly
You make the world feel alright
