// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin Mother and Child, holy
Infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing
Alleluia.
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.

Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light,
Radiant beams from
Thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Silent night, holy night, wondrous star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King.
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.

// Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir,
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that Santa's on his way,
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.
And every mother's child will want to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two,
Although it's been said many times, many ways,
Merry Christmas to you.
They know that Santa's on his way

// Little Drummer Boy //

Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our new born King to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor Him,
Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

Baby Gesu
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy to,
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you
Pa rum pum pum
On my drum

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pum pum
I played my best for Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then He smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum...

// Give Love On Christmas Day //

People making lists, buying special gifts,
It's a time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas day)
Oh even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas day (on Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas day)
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know that there's one cares
Give love on Christmas day (Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes the world needs your love

Why don't you give love on Christmas day (on Christmas Day)
Oh every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day (Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes the world needs your love

// Love Comes With Christmas //

I know you're pleased with all the presents
That you found lying under the tree
I can tell it brought some gladness to your heart
But on this yuletide holiday
Would you pause and give a little thought to me
And we can share the most important gift of all

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

I know the wine, roasting holly
Will grace the table with all the trimmings on that day
As we wish each other's families peace and joy
And mistletoe and all it's splendor
May be seen hanging from each welcome door
But we feel the same way we felt the day before

Cause we know Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

It's a happy time whether rain, snow, or sunshine
The world is slow, it's cold, we celebrate
With kisses warm, I'll give you one for every season
And renew the vows we made our wedding day

So let the bells bring down the children
Leave the beds with the coming of the dawn
To see that Santa kept his promise and came to call
While we both watch them in satisfaction
When we have each other Summer, Spring or Fall

We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year
We know that Love comes with Christmas
And goes with every other day of the year

// Christmas Everyday //

Now that it Christmas time
And if you say you would be mine,
It would be Christmas every day.
And baby I'm in love in you,
And if you say you love me too,
It would be Christmas everyday.

What a lovely Christmas!
Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground.
I said Christmas, Christmas in the summer time
If I had you around.
Christmas in the spring time
And baby that ain't all:
If I had you to say you love me too
It would be Christmas even in the fall.

I wrote and told Santa Claus 

I needed you because it would Christmas everyday
And I would have the Christmas spirit all though the year
It would be Christmas everyday.

Christmas everyday!
Everyday would be Christmas
Christmas everyday!
Lady if I had you.
Christmas everyday!
A Christmas everyday
Christmas everyday!

I wrote and told Santa Claus 
I needed you because it would Christmas everyday.
And I would have that Christmas spirit all though the year;
It would be Christmas everyday.

Christmas, Christmas in the winter time,
When the snow falls on the ground.
What a lovely Christmas,
Christmas in the summer time
A when it's hot we'll still have fun
A lovely Christmas
Christmas in the spring time!
When the little birdies sing
You got me walking got me talking 'bout Christmas
Christmas in the fall time!
I got that Christmas spirit.
Everyday, everyday!
Christmas everyday!
Everyday!
Christmas everyday!
Everyday, everyday!
Christmas everyday!
