// I Can't Get Next To You //

Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it, listen

I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land

But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
Next to you (I can't get next to you)
I just can't get next you (I can't get next to you, babe)
(I can't get next to you)

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
No matter what I do (I can't get next to you)
Uh-yah

Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause, girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, oh I can't get next to you

Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get, now (next to you)
Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get...

// Hey Jude //

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

// Don't Let The Joneses Get You Down //

[Dennis:] Ow, people gather round me, it's whom it may concern.
I'm not trying to run your life.

[Melvin:] But you're never too old to learn, huh.

You're so busy following the Joneses, you ain't got time to show it.
Keeping up with the Joneses, it'll only makes your life a mess.
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and getting deeper in debt.

[Eddie:] You better leave...
[Group:] The Joneses alone.
[Dennis:] Tell 'em one more time.

[Group:] Worry 'bout the Joneses.

[Melvin] Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay.
[Group:] So leave Jo-Jo-Joneses alone.
[Dennis:] Listen, your car might be old, but remember it never fails to get you where you want to go.

[Eddie:] Oh, don't let the Jones
[Dennis:] Don't let the Jones

[Paul:] Now listen, if you see something you want and you know you can't afford it,
The very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it.
[Dennis:] The Joneses have been a downfall for many persons, you see.
So people, take my advice and let the Joneses be. Ow.

// Message From A Black Man //

[Melvin:] Yes, my skin is black,
But that's no reason to hold me back
[Eddie:] Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
I have wants and desires,
Just like you
So move on the side
'Cause I'm comin' through, oh!

[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
Eddie and Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now, oooh...

[Melvin:] Yes, your skin is white...
Does that make you right?
[Eddie:] Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
This is a message
A message to y'all,
Together we stand,
Divided we fall, oh!

[Dennis:] Black is a color
Just like white,
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right,
We all have our faults...
Yes we do

[Eddie:] So look in your mirror
[Temptations:] Look in the mirror
[Eddie:] What do you see?
[Temptations:] What do you see?
[Eddie:] Two eyes,
[Temptations:] Two eyes,
[Eddie:] A nose, and a mouth just like me, oh!

[Eddie:] Your eyes are open
But you refuse to see,
The laws of society
Were made for both you and me,
Because of my color,
I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones,
May break my bones
But in the end,
You're gonna' see my friend, oh!

[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
[chorus repeated several times through music, or "the bridge"]

[after a few minutes, above chorus is repeated as song nears end, and then...]

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
[Dennis:] I'm black and I'm proud!
[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
[Dennis:] I'm black and I'm proud!
[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

// Little Green Apples //

And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to schoolâ€¦goodbye
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand
And squeezes it 'n' says "How ya feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way

And if that ain't lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns

[FADE]

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis

// You Don't Love Me No More //

A tender love we once shared
A joyous love we once cared
Now our love is just a shattered dream
So far away from me you're driftin'it seem
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love more
You once said your love for goes beyond compare
The esctasy we once felt in our hearts we no longer share
And each kiss seem to say farewell my dear
There's nothing left of this love is oh so clear
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love me no more
You just don't love me no more, awww
You don't love me no more
Owwwww baby
I can tell that someone else has taken my place
Though you keep the truth from showing on your face
You think you have me fooled but you don't realize
I can see the truth when I look into your eyes
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more, owwww
IIIIIIIIIII...
I can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more
I, I oh I I can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more

// Since I've Lost You //

The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
(Oh, yeah)
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
(Oh, yeah)
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

Next time I'll be kinder
(Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her?
(Won't you please help me find her?)

Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
(Of this love she left behind her)

Till I find her I'll be trying ta
(Till I find her I'll be trying ta)
Everyday I'm more inclined ta
Find her

Inclined ta
Find her
Inclined ta find my baby
Been looking everywhere
(Baby)
Baby, I really, really care

Oh, determination is fading fast
(Oh, yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past
(Oh, yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Oh, since I lost my baby)

I feel so bad
(Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad
(Since I lost my baby)

Everything is wrong
This heart is hard to carry on
(Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be
(Since I lost my baby)

What's gonna happen to me?

// Running Away (Ain't Gonna Help You) //

Running away sure, ain't gonna help you

Oh girl, why won't you talk to me on the phone?
Every time I call, you disguise your voice
And tell me you're not at home

And girl this cold shoulder you're giving me
I don't understand
Could it be that you've already got yourself a man
If not

Running away sure, ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get now
Running away sure, ain't gonna help you
I'm gonna get you girl, I'm gonna get

Could it be, could it be
That you're afraid of me?
If so I never recall giving you a reason
You know how much I love you

// That's The Way Love Is //

After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed, oh yeah
You're left alone and brokenhearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last nobody knows, oh oh

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road, girl
And your heart's carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
And your whole world's cavin' in
Listen to me, now's the time to be strong
You've gotta forget him, woo-hoo, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is

Let me run somethin' down to you, baby
Love can be a hurting thing
And it can be as warm as a person's scream
When love is present, everything is alright
But when it's gone you toss and turn all night

The road of love is rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're goin' through
I bet you wish that you were never born
You've got to forget him, ooh, now that he's gone
Remember...

That's the way love is, baby
That's the way love is, ooh

Love is here today, gone tomorrow
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is)
Ooh, one day gladness, the next day sadness
That's the way love is, sho'nuff, how it is
(That's the way love is)
Love just comes and goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

// Slave //

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Hear that sound
The hammers pound and pound
From sun up to sundown
Men from all walks of life
Are livin' here in shame
Now they're known by numbers
They've been stripped of their name

Oh, breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

In the morning I slave in the hot sun for little or no wage
At night I'm locked in, like an animal in a cage
Man stunted on me with a gun
Sayin' "I bet a man"
Oh, in a hole I have to spend
The rest of my time

Hey, breaking rocks, y'all
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Ow, hold it steady right there while I hit it, hit it!
While I'm breakin' it down, I'm gonna get it now

Inside these walls, the days seem to never end
In this place there's no such thing as a friend
Sometimes, sometimes, I wish I was there
I can't get no sleep, I've got rats in my bed, ooh

Breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
Or I'll surely be a goner

(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)
(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)

(I'm just a slave, yah)
(I'm just a slave, y'all)

Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

Jailer, bring me water
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
Jailer, bring me water (Breakin' rocks, servin' my time)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (So I can get out to find peace of mind)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Ooh, jailer, bring me water (I'm breakin' rocks, servin' my time)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (So I can get out to find peace of mind)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Oh oh, jailer, bring me water (Always have it right here, while I hit it)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)
I can't pound no longer (I've had some bet, gonna get it back)
(Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!)

Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
