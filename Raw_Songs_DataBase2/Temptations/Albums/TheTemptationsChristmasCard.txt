// Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer //

[Paul:]
You Know there's Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen.

[Dennis:]
Comet and Cupid an Donner and Blitzen.

[Eddie:]
Oh, but do you recall...

[Otis:]
The most famous reindeer of all?

[Eddie:]
Whoa-o-o-o-o

[Melvin:]
His name is...

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it.
You would even say it glows.

All of the other, other, other reindeer.
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph.
Join in any reindeer games.

(Then one foggy Christmas eve)
You know (Santa came to say...)

(Hey Rudolph)
You, with your nose so bright.
Melvin: Come on, come on, come on, come on and guide my sleigh tonight.

Then how the reindeer loved him.
As they shouted out with glee. (Hey Rudolph)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
You'll go down in history.

(Then one foggy Christmas eve)
Santa came to say...

(Hey Rudolph)
You, with your nose so bright.
Melvin: Come on, come on, come on, come on and guide my sleigh tonight.

Then how the reindeer loved him.
As they shouted out with glee. (Hey Rudolph)
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
You'll go down in history.

Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh.
Ooo, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh.
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, come on and guide my sleigh tonight.
Hey, hey, hey, Rudolph, with your nose so bright.

// My Christmas Tree //

There's a Christmas tree
In a window frame
Just inside my door
But my Christmas tree
Doesn't look the same
As it always has before
There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present
A girl ever had
Has gone away from me
Oh, my Christmas tree is not very big
In fact it's kind of small
Honey went, he picked 'em out
They always seem so tall
The lights don't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas bright
Is gone away from me
I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas is
My baby back at home
oh, my Christmas tree's so sad and bare
My room's so big and cold
They wish me happy new year
But the new year is already on
There's no little angel
On top where it used to be
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...

// Santa Claus Is Coming To Town //

Well, boy and girls, it's Christmas time again.

So, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list
And checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So, be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now, listen, he sees when you're sleeping,
And he knows when you're awake.
He knows if you've beed bad or good
So, be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Little tin horns
And little toy drums
A rooty-toot-toot
And a rumpa-bum-bum
Santa Claus is comin' to town

So, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Ooh

// Someday At Christmas //

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime

// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Ooh, white Christmas
Sleigh bells in the snow

Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

// Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! //

Oh the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
and since we've no place to go
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
and it doesnt show signs of stopping
and i've brought some corn for popping
the lights are turned way down low
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
when we finally kiss goodnight
how i'll hate going out in the storm
but if you really hold me tight
all the way home i'll be warm
and the fire is slowly dieing
and my dear is still goodbyeing
but as long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Instrumental]

and the fire is slowly dieing
and my dear is still goodbyeing
but as long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
let it snow

// Silver Bells //

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style,
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile,
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmastime in the city.
Hear the bells go ding-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.
Strings of street lights, even stop lights blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmastime in the city.
Hear the bells go ding-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.
