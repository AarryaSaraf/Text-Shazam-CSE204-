// Psychedelic Shack //

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
People - let me tell you about a place I know
To get in it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing, oh yeah
It's got a neon sign outside that says
Come in and take a look at your mind
You'd be surprised what you might find, yeah
Strobe lights flashing from sunup to sundown
People gather there from all parts of town
Oh yeah, what do I call it
You know it's just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah oh yeah
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
There ain't no such thing as time
Incense in the air
Peace signs painted everywhere
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind
Music so high, you can't get over it
So low you can't get under it (Let me tell you that)
Right around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah 

Millionaires, kings and queens go there to do their things
You might see anybody there, yeah
Bear skin rugs, tails and beads
Don't really matter what you wear
You can take off your shoes, sit on the floor
Join in and be what you wanna be
Don't you know that it's right
Around the corner just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at

They got a cat there shouting the blues
Talking about paying some dues
People walking around reciting poetry
Screaming guitars and a thousand colored lights
People I'm telling you this place is really out of sight
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
I guarantee this place will blow your mind
Don't you know it's right around the corner
Just across the track
People I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

// You Make Your Own Heaven And Hell Right Here On Earth //

Kumba ya-ya
Oh my soul, of my whole ya-ya-ya
Price so right, my whole ya-ya-ya

Born into this world a baby,
You're mind is clear as the air
Time passes...
You learn to walk and talk
Time passes...
You learn right from wrong
Time passes...
You leave home seeking a life
Of your own...

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people...
You make your own heavens and hell
Right here on earth

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make you own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
On earth, on earth, on earth...

Time passess...
And your values change
Life becomes a strange, confusing game
Suddenly you want the finer things in life
But you find it takes a lots of hard work
Now you're standing
At the crossroads of life
To satisfy your personal wants...
Will you do wrong
Or will you do right?
Well one thing you must admit,
And you know it's true
The final decision,
Is still up to you

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people...
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
Let me tell you one more time...
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth

Listen people...
Life is a giant, invisible scale with two sides;
Good and bad
You and your beliefs
Are the weights
The things you do each day
Determine the balance
Your conscience is a flawless
Judge and jury;
The only question is what you want

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth
One more time, now listen...
I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world

You make your own heaven and hell
Right here on earth

[Temptations repeat above chorus starting with I'm tellin you...etc, to the end of song.]

// Take A Stroll Thru Your Mind //

One drag, that's all it took
One drag, that's all it took

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah

People I got sunshine on a cloudy day, ya
I got sunshine, sunshine on a cloudy day, have mercy
People I'm grooving, groovin' me and myself, dig?
I'm just groovin', groovin' me and myself, oh Lord, have mercy

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, hmm
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah, just me

Callin' on the group to give me a little whoop, whoop
Callin' on the group to give me a little whoop, whoop
Whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop, whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop
Whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop, hmm, hmm
Whoop, whoop, yeah, whoop

Take out your crayon and coloring book
And color me out

My mind sleeping but I'm wide awake
My mind sleeping but I'm wide awake
One drag, that's all it took

Welcome to the circle, ya, we'll decide, you dig?
'Cause you people look at us like we're freaks
Ding, dong, dang, ain't no thang baby

There is no young, there is no old
Reach and touch your soul

Tell me, have you ever been off the ground
For a long, nice and slow? Here we go

Seems like every Monday morning I've got the blues
And every Tuesday, I get some bad news
Wednesday worse 'cause I ain't got a dime to my name
I done worked so hard all week

Thursday, my body just racked with pain
Here come the good part
Friday the eagle flies and so do I
I wonder if you hear me when I say
The eagle flies on Friday and so do I, yeah, just listen

Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find
Take a stroll through your mind
You'll be surprised at what you might find, yeah

// War //

Oh no-there's got to be a better way
Say it again
There's got to be a better way-yeah
What is it good for?
War has caused unrest
Among the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Yeah
War-I despise
'Cause it means destruction
Of innocent lives
War means tears
To thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight
And lose their lives
I said
War-huh
It's an enemy of all mankind
No point of war
'Cause you're a man
War has caused unrest
Among the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Give it to me one time-now
Give it to me one time-now
War has shattered
Many young men's dreams
We've got no place for it today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord, there's just got to be a better way
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker
War
War
War-good God, now
Now
Give it to me one time now
Now now
What is it good for?

// You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You) //

Well, well, well, well
Seems like it was only yesterday
When my mama told me don't fall in love
With the first guy that comes your way

He was handsome and nice
But, I took her advice and passed him by
Years have passed and don't look like
Love's gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life's like mine
Needs a helping hand well, well
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way
You look when I'm looking at you
I know it ain't fit and proper
For a girl to talk this way

But, I can't cope with this loneliness
Not one more doggone day
Everyday has been an uphill climb
Keeping my hopes a-float

Judging from your silence boy
You must be in the same boat
Ain't it true now?
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way you look
When I'm looking at you
Well, well, well, you need love like I do
(Don't you?)

// Friendship Train //
