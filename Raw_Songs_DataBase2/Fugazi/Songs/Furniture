This is a song with no words.

But no one can hear the missing.

They just look at my mouth

And look at my mouth

And say hey man, I know where you're coming from.

Furniture has no say in life,

It was made to be used by people.

How many times have you felt like a bookcase

Sitting in living room gathering dust

Full of thought already written?

This is a song with no words.

But no one can hear the missing.

You can see my mouth and see that it's moving

I think you already know where I'm coming from

Right here.
