Generation fuck you to define and redefine

You'd make them all the same but molds they break away

Safely inside looking outside go keep on picking at it it's just going to get bigger

Not yet an also-ran the note left in your hand is by you

Asked to cease and desist what aggravation preordained

It feels so good laying down

I won't ask to get up again

Where's my life you're in control like you don't know

Don't say you're along for the ride

Sitting down when you should stand

The line is in your hand

and it's by you

Hand over hand over hand
