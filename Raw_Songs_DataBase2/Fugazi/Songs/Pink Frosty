Animosities and apologies

Back and forth we struggle,

Falter, refrain with glue and string and deciphering

We try, try, try to stay together

Despite the pain it's not our first time through nor our

Waterloo back and forth from situation

We move to episode

But if we can find some piece of mind

Intertwined the delivery is worth the load
