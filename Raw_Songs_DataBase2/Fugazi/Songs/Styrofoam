There are no more races to be run

There are no numbers left to be won

Everybody's down we pulled each other down

There never was a truth to be found

We are all bigots so full of hatred

We release our poisons

There are no more cultures left to slide

There are no more people to be tried

We're in our minds five billion pieces so defined

Read it in a book, it was underlined

We are all bigots so full of hatred

We release our poisons like styrofoam
