Here's a list of side effects

Practice tested

Covering every malice angle

For example you will sleep forever

You will never sleep again

Yawn to yawn your face is born to mask the shade of shit you're in

Now it's time to fake resignment room assignment

Next door to the generator

What the fuck it is

Whatever powers lights to burn all night

Your teeth to grind to grind so fine

You'll find out sooner what it is

To ring the alarm or you're sold to dying

Fell, destroyed and long out used step into it

Green in laying water blue

Cop a feeling coprophagics

Say next in line well how about you

Freedom's fiction sorry fifteen time to sell the softer shoe

Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying

(respects to tenor saw)
