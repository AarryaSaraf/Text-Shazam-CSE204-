Born into race and nation accept family and obligation
I'm not a citizen I'm not a citizen
Embrace tradition and occupation
Cull memory for assimilation secure for future generations
Secure for future generations
I'm not a citizen I'm not a citizen laying in this cold field
Waiting for the call feeling right here in this uniform I think I got
Them all academic or street education obtain degree in annihilation I'm not
A citizen I'm not a citizen laying down in chambers waiting for the call
Seen your kind so many times you got no chance at all laid out immobile
Hoping for that call it's in my mouth, under my skin sodium pentathol
