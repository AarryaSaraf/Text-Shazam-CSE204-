Looking out for cars and mortality trying to find some sort of geometry
Avoiding mistakes keep an eye on every step I take
Everything is building and it appears that you're all architects and engineers
That's how it looks that's how it looks from here
I'm an ex-spectator can't you see
I'm an ex-spectator never let me, never let my, never let my vision get in the way of
Here's some questions that the writer sent
Can an observer be a participant?
Have I seen too much?
Does it count if it doesn't touch?
If the view is all I can ascertain pure understanding is out of range
If I make that call why can't I make that change?
I'm an ex-spectator can't you see?
I'm an ex-spectator never let my never let my vision get in the way of me
