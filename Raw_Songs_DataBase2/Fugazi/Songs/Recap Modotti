Recap in taxi

No clothes no food

Take care of the children

We'll send for you soon

Alien you find you feel at home everywhere

You'll get by with so much less than anyone

Decieved entrapment through belief

Disclosure would decree

Accusations would be shed

Instead we stand over the dead

The vultures all well fed

Killer running free

Outside the window

The passing night sky fills with people I know

Taking me home
