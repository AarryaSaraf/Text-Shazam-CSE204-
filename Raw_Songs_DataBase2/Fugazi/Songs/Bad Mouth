You can't be what you were

So you better start being 

just what you are

You can't be what you were

the time is now is running out 

is running out 

is running running running out

You can't be what you were

So you better start living the life

That you're talking about

You can't be what you were


The no movement, the no movement, the no movement

In a bad mouth

It betrays a bad mind

The no movement, the no movement, the no movement

In a bad mouth

It betrays a bad mind

The no movement, the no movement

It betrays a bad mind

The no movement, the no movement, the no movement

In a bad mouth

It betrays a bad mind


You're always talking talking talking talking talking shit now

but you will talk yourself down

you're going way down!
