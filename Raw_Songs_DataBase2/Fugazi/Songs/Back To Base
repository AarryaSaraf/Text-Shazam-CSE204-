Autonomy is a world of difference

They're creeping round but they know they can't come in

Back from the front with observation it's still there

Across from me an extreme example

Bringing you what they want twenty four hours a day

Whole lot of not but it's convenient pray for fire

They'll tell you anything

It's speculation pure speculation

Bringing you back to base
