Oh a leader walks with force 
Oh a leader makes the most of what he can, of what he can
Oh a leader flaunts his strength 
Oh a leader takes command of what he can, of what he can.

But he always carries a stick

Oh a leader fills the bags
Oh a leader joins the ranks when he can, when he can
Oh a leader takes good aim 
Oh a leader plays the game when he can, when he can

But he always carries a stick
But he always carries a stick
