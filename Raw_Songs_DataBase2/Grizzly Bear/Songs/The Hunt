Prove it all to me
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
If you call again it's absurd

And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth it's only in my eyes
And I always want to rescind everything I bought into
There's no name

Fool me once it's fair
The floodgates need repair
I count on you and why
There's nothing there besides

And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign

Another back and forth turn around
One that makes no sense but it feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me
