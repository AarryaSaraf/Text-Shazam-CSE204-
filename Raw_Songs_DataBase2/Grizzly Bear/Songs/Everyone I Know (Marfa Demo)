Every hour is so
I notice they are keep on talking ooohh
The rest of those moments
I don't wanna close this case

Under the geiser falls a 
I notice it and keep on bringing my hands
As if we are so cold
We both have a cold

Maybe it's something more than that
I don't want to talk with the folks in 
We are almost most low
This is like everyone I know
