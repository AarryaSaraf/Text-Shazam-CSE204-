I'll be back of the bill
I'll be there to see ya
Occurrences will
Make their way to be ya
That you'll have to realize
Something's moving to kill
I'll be there to see ya
Looking for their fill
Make their way to be ya
As you'll have to realize
And I keep falling behind
I keep falling behind
I keep falling behind
Are you...

It's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
