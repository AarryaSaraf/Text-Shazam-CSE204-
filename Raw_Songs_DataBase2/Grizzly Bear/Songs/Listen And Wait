A joker inside, a jumble man re-brought to life
And it's gone by the night, the morning brings it back, give back

And step towards the light
Imagine fades, a vision running wild
And hides in the lights
A battered face, smiles shouting loud
Listen and wait, for a voice that calls you on

Careful, find your balance 'fore you fall
Blinded, blind-sighted by yourself
Banished from that home you've always loved, so far

Down on the grass, dreamed nothing much
Stay where you are, we'll walk alone

Step towards towards the light
Imagine fades, a vision running wild
And hides in the lights
A battered face, smiles shouting loud
Listen and wait, for a voice that calls you on
