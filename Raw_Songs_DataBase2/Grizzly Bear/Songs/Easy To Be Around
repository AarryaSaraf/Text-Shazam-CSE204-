I was in the coal mine
Picking up diamonds
That the miners had left behind, behind, behind
And I admired their cold shine
Simple and bright
Pocketed many
In the cavernous night
Clear when held up to the light

You belong to no one
You are easy to be around 'cause
You belong to no one
You are easy to be around 'cause
You belong to no one
You are easy to be around and
I scattered them on the ground

The weight of your eyes
It decays you despise any weight
And because and because and because
You did it all

You are easy to be around
I like to walk beside you
You're so easy to be around
It's like, I'm not even walking beside you
We are rolling along the ground
One shadow made of mercury
We were two 'till we melted down
Now you're easy to be around
Easy to be around
Easy to be around
Easy to be around

Oh, I was in the coal mine
Picking up diamonds so heavy
I had to leave them all behind
Coming up from the mine shafts, sparkling bright
Laughing, having nothing in an infinite night
Clear and dangling in the light
Same as what you came with

You are easy to be around
'Cause the door remains the same width
You're so easy to be around
Forgetting what our name is
We were two 'till we melted down, now
You're easy to be around
Easy to be around
Easy to be around
Easy to be around
Easy to be around
