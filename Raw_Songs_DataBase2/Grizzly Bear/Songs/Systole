Once in a while
Come around and bleed it
This has got to end next time you're needing more

You can take it up with me any time
You're needing
Try once more, it'll stop the bleeding

Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home

You can take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home

Give a little more as your eyes grow colder
Even if it's all that you wanted, let it go

Take the sheets from the bed
Throw them all to the fire
Watch the room light up
'Til the flames grow warm and tired

Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home

You can take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home
