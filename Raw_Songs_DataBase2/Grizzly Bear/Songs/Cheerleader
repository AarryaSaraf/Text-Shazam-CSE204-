Mention a name we know, we know
Appear tame, it shows, shows
Please don't feign the ropes
Always the same, I know

I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter
I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter

There's no time to go
Through the designs we know
Never mind, although
Maybe this time, we'll grow

I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter
I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter
