My love's another kind
My love's another kind
My love's another kind

From the first morning light
I can follow along
Chance to stumble and find
What turns out to be wrong

And my love's another kind
My love's another kind

From the top, children yell
You can't talk to me now
You can search for a while
When your're rumbling around
