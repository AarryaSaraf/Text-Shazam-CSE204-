// Easier //

I know, I know
The doors won't close
The pipes all froze
Just let it go

I know, I know
(Argue with me)
The doors won't close
(I've got plenty)
The pipes are froze
(of dishes and time)
Just let it go
(cords in a bind)

I know, I know
(knots that we make)
The doors won't close
(fatal mistakes)
The pipes are froze
(let's recreate)
Just let it go
(an easier time)

I still can't find you
'Cause I still can't find you

// Lullabye //

Glass of gin and a folding chair
Sitting out by the wading pool
Chlorine blue

Rush of wind passing over me
Restless nights
Restless nights
Restless nights

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

My love's another kind
My love's another kind
My love's another kind

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

Chin up, cheer up
Chin up, cheer up
Chin up

My love's another kind
My love's another kind

// Knife //

I want you to know
When I look in your eyes
With every blow
Comes another lie

You think it's alright
You think it's alright
You think it's alright
You think it's alright

Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?

Knife
Knife
Knife

// Central And Remote //

In the wind, in the yoke
My ride will go
Central, remote
Any further and I'll know

Pressing matters bear

Through trials and time
I keep my feet right
In line for flight
So we never recognize

Pressing matters bear
An able wear and tear on you
Tear on you

Remind
Remind
Tear on you, wear on you

// Little Brother //

Wide eyed and up in arms
My little brother was a solemn one
He always had his quiet corner

Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner

Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner

Now go back to the other side of my bed
I'll go back to the place where you get started
And I'll sleep, just put the pillows under my head

// Plans //

Juan from Argentina
Such a strange predicament we find ourselves in
Baby, it's a long way to South America
Every option I have costs more than I've got
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there

All I have to give
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there

// Marla //

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the cello or yet the french horn
And I can't find the harp
I don't know where it's gone
And of course, you can't go without that

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find your clamshells
Your file or your drill
And your sheepskin-lined coat is eluding me still
And of course, you can't go without that

I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the dagger and oh why oh why
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
And of course, you can't go without that
You can't possibly go without that

// On A Neck, On A Spit //

My messenger in disguise
Makes up for such short goodbyes
You can't come home again
Each time it's different
And the yards around your feet
Fall away while you're asleep

Each day, spend it with me now
Each day, I spend it with me now
Each day, spend it with me now
All my time, spend it with me, but

Each day spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but

Each day spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but

Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me

Each day, spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but

Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me

// Reprise //

My love's another kind
My love's another kind
My love's another kind

From the first morning light
I can follow along
Chance to stumble and find
What turns out to be wrong

And my love's another kind
My love's another kind

From the top, children yell
You can't talk to me now
You can search for a while
When your're rumbling around

// Colorado //

When I clung to you
There was nothing to
Hold on tight with
You left me adrift

Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado

What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?

Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado

What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?

// Granny Diner //

Why won't you do any dishes? 
I always clean up the kitchen. 
Fine.
