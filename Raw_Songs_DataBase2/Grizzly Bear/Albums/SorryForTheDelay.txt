Album: SorryForTheDelay

// Sorry For The Delay //

I'll be back of the bill
I'll be there to see ya
Occurrences will
Make their way to be ya
That you'll have to realize
Something's moving to kill
I'll be there to see ya
Looking for their fill
Make their way to be ya
As you'll have to realize
And I keep falling behind
I keep falling behind
I keep falling behind
Are you...

It's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take
Between what's right and wrong
Baby, it's a lot of time to take

// A Leader Always Carried A Stick //

Oh a leader walks with force 
Oh a leader makes the most of what he can, of what he can
Oh a leader flaunts his strength 
Oh a leader takes command of what he can, of what he can.

But he always carries a stick

Oh a leader fills the bags
Oh a leader joins the ranks when he can, when he can
Oh a leader takes good aim 
Oh a leader plays the game when he can, when he can

But he always carries a stick
But he always carries a stick

// August March //

I'm gonna have
An accidental suicide
Nobody has to know
And when you come over
Notice the places 
I left everything

Wash the taste of me right out your mouth
Clean it good but don't forget about
(lock the door close the windows turn off the light it's alright)

// Owner Of A Lonely Heart //

Move yourself
You always lived your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way
Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
After my own decision
They confused me so 
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap 
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart 
Owner of a lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start 
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all 
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
