// I Don't Know Where Love Has Gone //

You know I never knew love could ever hurt this way
Baby, I never knew that a man could fall so deep in love this way
But baby there's so many things I don't know
And there's one thing that I wish I did know
Where is?
Where has our love gone?

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Where is the joy
The joy we used to know
How did we lose our love?
Where did our love go?
Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I, I... I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where love has gone
My darling, I... I don't know where love has gone
I don't know, guess I don't know, I don't know

I got to try
To make you understand
We've got to save our love
Undo it all again
Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Baby, you know what I feel like doing?
I feel like going out and buying me a one way ticket to anywhere
Just anywhere, I don't care

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I don't know where love has gone
Darling, I... I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't know...)
I, I don't know where love has gone
(Gotta believe it... One way ticket anywhere, I don't care)
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone...

// If You Know, Won't You Tell Me //

It's just not the same
You know what I mean when I say it's not the same
It's just not the same
Something has come between us
Something that's happening to us that I...
Baby that I just can't quite explain
I wanna sit down calmly and try and talk about it
Because I can't seem to find the reason why we're, we're drifting apart
Ya dig?

When I make love to you
You don't react anymore
You lay there like you don't care
You never did that before
How am I supposed to feel? what should I do?
What if it wasn't me, but you?
What would you do?

If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
Ooooooh
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby

Is this the way you're tryin' to say you don't want me
I hope it's not, you're all I've got
With you I wanna be
You're all I'm living for, you know it's true
What if it wasn't me, but you?
What would you do?

If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right, right now, right, right, right now
Right, right, right, right now
Right now, right now
If you know

Ooooh
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
Right now, right now
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me now, tell, tell me now
Tell me now, right now, right now

If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't, won't you tell me
Right, right now
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now
Right now baby
If you know, if you know

// I'm So Blue And You Are Too //

Has it come to this?
After all the love we've shared together
And all the love we've known together
Tell me, has it come to this?
Baby we're sitting here together and yet, and yet it's not the same
Because here in my heart I'm very sad
I feel so bad

Now I'm so blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

Oh, what sense does, does it make
For us to break, our hearts in two
Love is still the answer, for me
My darling, and you

I'm so blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

Nothing good come easy
And that means our love too
If it's worth having, it's worth keeping
After all, look at what we been through

This is not the way, this is not the way for us baby
We know how to make it right
And we know how to make it strong
And now we gotta get it back, where it belongs

I'm blue
You are too
Love, oh, what a shame
Girl what can we do?
I'm blue
And you are too
What a shame
What can we do?

Love is still the answer for me my darling
You, are blue
Girl you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?
Love, I'm blue
And you are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we do?

My, I'm blue
You are too
Oh, what a shame
What can we, what can we do about it?
My, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my

// Baby, We Better Try To Get It Together //

(We better try)
(Try to get ourselves together, baby)
Oh, we, oh, we better try
Try to get ourselves together, baby

Oh, girl, I swear I've got to talk to you
There's something that I feel we need to do
Let's take the time to try to figure out
What's happened to us, baby, what's it all about

We're getting further from each other every day
We can't just sit by and watch love walk away
If we don't try to save the love we got
Once we lose it, girl, we're gonna lose a lot

Oh, we, oh, we better, girl, try
Try to get ourselves, baby
We, oh, we better, girl, try
Try to get ourselves, baby

We've had it hard, we've had it cold, we've had it rough
It never changed a thing between the two of us
We always found a way to face it all together
We need each other now, darling, more than ever

We've got to find the love we used to know
Oh, if we find that love we'll learn to let it go
Oh, what a shame if we lose all that
'Cause once we lose it, girl, we never get it back

Girl, we better, oh, try
Try to get ourselves, baby
We, oh, we better, oh, try
Try to get ourselves, baby

We, oh, we better

We're getting further from each other every day
Oh, we can't just sit by and watch love walk away
If we don't try to save the love we got
Once we lose it, girl, we're gonna lose a lot

Oh, we, we better try
Try to get ourselves, baby
We, oh, we better try
Try to get ourselves, baby

We, oh, we better try
Try to get ourselves, baby
We, oh, we better try
Try to get ourselves, baby

We, oh, we better try
(Try to get ourselves, baby)
(We better try)
(Try to get ourselves, baby)

(We better try)

// You See The Trouble With Me //

I'm like a blind man who lost his way
I can't see nothin'
I'm like a deaf man who can't relay
Yeah, I can't hear nothin'

You see the trouble with me
I can't do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy

I walk the lonely streets late at night
Cold and lonely
Everything I do is wrong, never right
I'm lonely for her only

See the trouble with me
I can't do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy

See the trouble with me
I can't do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be, what do I do
It's gonna drive me crazy

See the trouble with me
I can't do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be, what do I do
It's gonna drive me crazy

See the trouble with me
I can do nothin' without my baby
And as plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy

// Let The Music Play //

One ticket, please
Lord have mercy, everybody's there
Hey, what's goin' on man, yeah
She's at home, yeah, she's at home
Yeah, she's at home

Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
On and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I'm out here dancin' and still, huh
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
See, it's like it's no longer there
I've got to hide what's killin' me inside

Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Ah, movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Ah, let it play on and on, let it play on and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, play on and on, play

I think I'm gonna be alright, ha, ha, ha
If I can make it through the night, oh, Lord
I'll just pretend she's here with me
I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me

Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Ah, here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long...

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Let it play on, let it play on, let it play on
Please, let it play on, let it play on
