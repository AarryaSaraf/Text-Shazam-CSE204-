// Girl It's True, Yes I'll Always Love You //

There's that look again
You know what I'm talking about
That insecure that unsure that, that wondering, look.
It's all in your eyes baby
You're sitting there and you're wondering
Does he really love me as much as he says he does?
Does he really need me and want me as much as he says he does?
Baby I can't 
Sit around you twenty four hours a day telling you baby I love you, I need you  and I want you
But I feel like right now right at this moment
I should try to clear and make you feel reassured about me, huh!
Woman are sensitive
Very sensitive
Baby let me tell you something you know
Just as hard as a woman can love a man
A man can love his woman
And baby believe me 
I do love you
Everything I have is you

And I don't like to see you look this way 
I don't like to see you feel this way
I don't
I want you to be together
and know and feel and be sure at all times
We're going to make it baby, huh!
You better believe me 
The world is ours, no doubt in my heart or my mind,
You and me babe, huh!
Just you, and me, I know, you know why?

Because, if I thought, I would lose you, 
I couldn't feel the way that I do
In you I found, my world of ecstasy
Honey you are, honey you're all I need.
You and me together, we were meant to be, yeah.

Girl its true, yeah, girl I'll always love you, I do, yes I'll always love you, its true.
Yes I'll always love you, its true, girl, yes I'll always love you,

With every step I make and every breath I take, you and me baby, you and me.
Girl I know, we're going make it,
Cause what we feel is real
And we don't have to fake it
I'm giving you, everything I've got
And truly I, I don't want to ever stop.
You and me together, girl we were meant to be.

Yes its true, yeah, Girl I'll always love you, I do, girl I'll always love, its true.
It's true, yeah, yes I'll always love you, I do, yes I'll always love, its true.
oh yeah, oh yeah.

// You're My Baby //

Sit down, right here sit down
I wanna talk to you
There's nothing wrong

I, I'm not upset
It's nothing like that
I just got to talk to you

You see I got a problem
A real serious problem
I miss you girl
Oh baby I miss you

And the funny thing about it is
We're not apart and we are together
I love you and you love me
And we are happy together but

Sometimes when you're not here
And we aren't together
I, I, I just get so so hung up
Mentally and spiritually too
I don't know if I going or coming
And I know that I'm, I'm a man and
I feel just like you feel

To love someone as much as I love you
To need and to want someone
As much as I want you
Sometimes it, sometimes it gets next to me baby
That's just the way it is

Is such a glory to be this way I guess
It's just when you're not here
I miss you baby
Girl I miss

Your on my mind
Girl I'm crazy
Your loves the type
Just my kind of crazy

My sadness is gone
When your appear
When you're here
Cuz my baby
You're my baby

And I do believe that I'm mad about you
Don't ever leave
I just can't live without you
Girl you're my life
My world and dreams
My joy and laughter
My everything

You're my baby
You're my baby

Funny as it seems
I live in a dream
I dream of you
And me
Baby always together
Loving forever
And breaking up
Breaking up never

You're my baby
You're my baby

Funny as it sounds
I need you around
As long as I live
I'll be you're with me
For all eternity
Always always

You're my baby
My my baby
Ohhh yeah
You're my baby
My my baby
Yeah yeah
You're my baby

Yeah yeah
Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah

I'm glad to know that
That you understand
And I'm glad the love
That you feel is the same way too
The greatest thing I ever did in
My life is loving you

My my baby
My my baby
Ohh yeah yeah
Ohh yeah

I'm loving you
I'll be loving you baby
Always and always and always and always and always

// Hard To Believe That I Found You //

Ain't it a groove?
It really is, isn't it? It really is

Baby, you know what just sitting here thinking
How happy we are right now
And the way we are with each other
The way we've been with each other
You know every now and then two people get to share to know
Love as we know it and as we share it
And I really wish
It probably doesn't mean nothing to no one else
But, I really, really wish
That all women all over the world
Could be loved as much as I love you
That could be needed and wanted
As much as you are
You see baby, to me it's
It's like sometimes I think to myself and I say, humph!
Brother, you're really lucky
You've got a woman that loves you
That needs you
That pleases you
A woman that does everything on earth that a man could dream of
You got a woman that makes you feel real
A woman that keeps you strong, right on!
A woman that means so many things in so many ways
You've got it all, humph!
So, you see baby, I really can't
I really can't help myself when I
When I tell you that
That I love you, baby
And I thank God for you
And I want you to know that I do
And you know sometimes I get so
So emotional over you, I
I just wanna run out in the street and scream and shout and
And just tell the world
I'm in love oh, I found that one, I found that someone

I just believe that I found you
Never knew love could be so true and ooh
What did I ever say, I'd do, yeah
Whatever made you love me too, yeah!

You know I could go on forever and ever and ever and ever
You know that, don't you baby?
But, I want to sit here
You and me close together
Next to each other
And dig this album 'cause this album is
Just for you
And I want you to dig it 'cause it's ought site, I really dig it
Huh, you like to the way it makes you feel?
Huh, well right on then, huh, right on
I love you baby
Ooh, I love you
Uh

// Never, Never Gonna Give You Up //

Whatever, whatever
Girl, I'll do
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through

I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand

Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too

'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more

And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Whatever you want
Girl, you got
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it

You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dyin' day

I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill

'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more

And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do

I'm never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Oh, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you

I'm never, ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my stick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to
