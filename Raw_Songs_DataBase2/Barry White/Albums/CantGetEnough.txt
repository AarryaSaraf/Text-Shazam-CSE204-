Album: CantGetEnough

// You're The First, The Last, My Everything //

We got it together, didn't we?
We definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't that nice?
I mean, when you really sit and think about it, isn't it really, really nice?
I can easily feel myself slipping more and more ways
Slip in world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together, baby

The first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep for evermore
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

In you I've found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see if you, you make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many way that I
Can love you till the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl you're my reality
But I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

You and me, babe
Just you and me
You are the first, the last, my everything

// I Can't Believe You Love Me //

I love to talk to you, it's not every day that a man
Can find a woman that, that he just loves talking to
Different strokes for different folks
And you know what baby? That's very very very very true
We're into our own world, in our own way
Doin' our own thing
And I hope that you can
Truly truly understand what I'm trying to say to you right now
Because I think that it's very important that you know what
That you realize just what you are to me
You're not just another woman, you're not just another fling
You're not just another ego trip, you are my hope to die woman
Needing you is a part of what I feel for you
Wanting you is a part of what I feel for you
But loving you, baby that's all of me to you
I've been blessed, I swear to God I've been blessed
Because I've got you
And everything that I want to be
And everything that I have to be
And everything that I've got to be
It's all because of you baby, all because of you

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

Girl you're mine to love, to keep
I declare, I swear, you're so doggone sweet
To share your love alone with me
And give your love so tenderly
How lucky can I be, oh babe
My pretty little babe, oh babe oh no babe

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

To find a love like yours these days
I declare, I swear, ain't no way
Girl my world is at your feet
And a love so real and so complete
For eternity, oh babe
My precious little babe, mmmm oh no babe

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

Ah yeah, oh yeah, oh no

I can't believe girl that you want me
I can't believe that you want me
My darling, I I can't, girl I can't believe it, honey I can't believe it, girl I just can't believe it
I I can't I can't believe girl I just can't believe that you want me, you want me, yeah you want me, you want me
I can't believe that you want me, girl you want me
Every word of is true, baby I swear
And all that I own is for you
I can't I can't believe, girl I can't believe, honey I can't believe
Girl I can't believe
...

// Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe //

I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I don't know about that
There's many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe
Oh babe

My darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe

Lord some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're near
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling I
I can't get enough of your love ,babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl you're so unreal
Still, I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do because you've blown my mind

I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin' moves
I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling I
Can't get enough of your love, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe

Can't get enough of your love, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, let me take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you

Oh no, babe
My darling I, can't get enough of your love babe
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love babe

// Oh Love, Well We Finally Made It //

Hey, you know I don't, I don't really give a damn
If it would have took forever, I would have waited, baby
And waited and waited and waited and waited and waited

I, oh yeah, um, baby love

I knew that everything will be alright
It had to work out sweet, my love at night
Ah, the two of us in love together
Henceforth, now and forever

We've only just begun to feel the fire grow
Our light of love will burn and let the people know
That we intend to make it, when trouble comes, we'll shake it
My love for you can no one take it, oh, lord, I just got to say it

Girl, well, we finally made it, my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh, my love, well, we finally made it
My, my, oh my, girl, you don't know
How long I've waited

Ooh, love, ah, my love, my, my
My love, my, my
Ooh, love
What would I do without you?

Nothing in this world could stop us now
We're going to make it, yeah, someway, somehow
So [Incomprehensible] to you and me
Let's keep our love happy and free
Free from all the hurt and pain, oh, I gotta say it again

Ooh love, girl, we finally made it, girl, my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh love, well, we finally made it
Girl, my, oh, my, ah, you don't know
Girl, you don't know how long I've waited

Ooh love, well, we finally made it, girl my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh, love, well, we finally made it
My, oh, my, girl, you don't know
How long I've waited

Ooh, love, my, oh, my
Ooh, love, my, oh, my
Ooh, love, my, oh, my

// I Love You More Than Anything (In This World Girl) //

You know I really wish him all the luck in the world
Cause he's gonna need it
He let you get away baby
Yeah I know he's got that sad, sad story
But I gotta story for him, goes like this
When ya move, ha, ya lose

Finders keepers, losers weepers
I don't care how he feels or what he tryin' to say
He never should've let you go, never should've let you stay
Now I've got you here at last, now he's certain and he's so sad
He better go out and try to find him someone new
Cause I don't see no other one but me, givin' his love to you
No, no

Cause I love you more than anything in this world, oh girl
And I need you more than anything in my world, oh girl

You know what I'm willing to do to keep you here?
Baby, any damn thing that I have to
That's the way it is baby, that's just the way it is

Lover and pleaser
Your happy keeper
That's the way I feel, I just can't help myself
Girl, low and deep you won't need love from no one else
Now I've got the chance to prove all the things that I've told you
With every breath I take, you're the air I breathe
And every step I make, you're always there with me
Oh, no

I love you more than anything in this world, oh girl
I need you more than anything in my world, oh girl
I love you more than anything in my world, oh girl

I love you and baby I need you

Finders keepers, oh losers weepers
Your lover and pleaser
Your happy keeper
Oh, misuse her you lose her
Confuse or abuse her

Baby you know what, I don't wanna hear a thang that he's got to say
Because you're here in my life now, that's where you're gonna stay
I don't wanna hear a sorry
I don't wanna hear a reason why
I don't wanna hear a nah-pish
Cause for your love I'd rather fight than switch
