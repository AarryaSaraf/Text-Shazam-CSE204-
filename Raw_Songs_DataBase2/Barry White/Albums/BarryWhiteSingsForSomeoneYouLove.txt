// It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me //

When we met, it wasn't quite clear to me
What you had in store was there for only me
Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye

There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes

I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
In ecstasy when you're layin' down next to me
Oh, no, no, ecstasy, yeah, when you're layin' down next to me

I find it hard for me to concentrate
If I don't make my move, girl, it might be too late
I've got to make sure you don't get away
After all you done, girl, to make me wanna stay

All my life I've been searchin' for a star
Now my search is over and here we are
Livin' in ecstasy, yeah, when you lay down next to me, yeah
Here in ecstasy, when you're layin' down next to me

I wanna hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
Livin' in ecstasy, well, when you're layin' down next to me
Ooh! ooh! wee, ecstasy, when you're layin' here with me, uh-huh

In this ecstasy when you are here with me, yeah
Oh, it's ecstasy, Lord knows when you're next to me, yeah

// You're So Good, You're Bad //

You're so good, girl, you're bad
(So good, so good)
You're the baddest thing I ever had
(So good, so good)

You're so good, girl, you are bad
(So good, so good)
You're the baddest thing I ever had
(So good, so good)

You're so good, you're bad
You're the baddest thing I ever had

(Ah...)

You're so good, girl, you're bad
You're the baddest thing I ever had

You're... you're so good, girl you are bad
(So good, so good)
You're the baddest thing I ever had
(So good, so good)

Ooh oh... you're good, you're bad
(So good, so good)
You're the baddest thing I ever had
(So good, so good)

(So good, so good)
(So good, so good)

// I Never Thought I'd Fall In Love With You //

When I first looked in your eyes
I found out I was crying for a prize

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

When I speak of love to you
I know you wonder if it's true

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

When I'm making love to you
It seems that's all I live to do

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

As the hands of time do change
My love for you, girl, will remain

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, no, not you
I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you, not you
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I, I, I, I, I never thought that you would love me too

I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too
I, I, I, I never thought I'd fall in love with you
I never thought that you would love me too

// Oh, What A Night For Dancing //

Oh we're going out tonight
Finger popping you look out-a sight
Won't be no stopping all the discotheques
Better be ready we're gonna hit em hard
Hard and heavy
Party strong all night long
Just you girl and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady oh
Oh what a night for dancing
Oh what a night for romancing

We're gonna laugh and dance half the night away
We're gonna scream and shout while the music plays
Then around about two, tell you what I'm gonna do
Girl I'm gonna take you home and stick plenty love to you
Let's get it on all night long, just you girl and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady oh
Oh what a night for dancing
Oh what a night for romancing
