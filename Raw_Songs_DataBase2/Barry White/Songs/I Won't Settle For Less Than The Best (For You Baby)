I get up every mornin'
Feelin' good inside, yeah
Girl, sharing love with you each night
Makes getting up feel so nice, yeah
Girl, you're warm as a summer breeze
Blowing gently across the seas, yeah baby
And I'm so mad about you
Couldn't live my life without you
No baby, yeah

When a man loves a lady
Like I'm lovin' you baby
He gives her all the things
That a real love can bring
Girl, you made my world
So bright, so nice

I won't settle for less
Than the best
For you lady
Oh no, nothing but the best
I won't settle for less
Just for you, baby

My days begin
And my night all end
With you baby
It's your love, no doubt about it
I wouldn't dare leave home without it
No baby

When a man loves a lady
Like I'm lovin' you baby
He gives her all the things
That real love can bring
Girl you made my world
So bright, so right

Just the best, and nothing less
Just the best, and nothing less
Just the best, and nothing less

I won't settle for less
Than the best
For you lady
No, nothing but the best
And nothing less
For you baby

(Nothing but the best) Girl, I like the way you move
(Nothing less) And all the things you do, yeah baby

Nothing but the best
Nothing less
The best
Nothing less
Nothing but the best
Nothing less
For you lady

Oh lord, yeah
Nothing but the best
And nothing less
Nothing but the best
And nothing less
