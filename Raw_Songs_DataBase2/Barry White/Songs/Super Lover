Super lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I would be a liar if I said I couldn't get higher
Than your love, than your love
Just that I'm under your power
Hour after hour from your love
Yes I am
Smooth sexy lady I like what you make me with your love
I need your love
With your supervision I know you won't agree
Your super lover's vision has took control of me
A super love connection is the only key
It takes a super lady to have a super guy like me
Super lover super woman
You really got me comin' off the ground I'm bound
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around (yea I can, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I can feel the fire, you fill me with desire
With your love, I want your love
Oooh you hypnotize me, the way you mesmerize me
With your love, give me your love
Burning lips of fire there's another risk
Touching is a part of you slow
Super love sensation, makes my body wet
I get so intensified and I can't let go
Super lover super woman
You just keep lifting my heart off the ground I'm bound

I'm really bound
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around
Super lover super woman
You really got me comin' off the ground really I'm off the ground
Super woman super lover
There really is no other to be found
Nowhere around
Super lover, yeah there is no other
Super woman, keep me comin'
Super lover, ain't no other
Here it comes 

Super lover, you got me covered
Super lover, girl there is no other
No, no, no, no,
I don't want no other.
