Any fool could see
You were meant for me
I just wanna be
With you, near you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
I love you, I need you

Have you ever stopped to wonder
What life is all about
Just when you think that you're going under
Love has a way to work it out

Girl, before you came
My life was full of pain
Everything was upside down, oh!
But then you, girl you pulled me through
You turned my world all around

Any fool could see
You were meant for me
Girl, I just wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
I love you, I need you

Now when I wake up in the morning
One thing is on my mind
Oh, that one thing is you, girl
I'm so glad I found you just in time

Heaven must surely be really mad at me
But it's gonna be alright, oh!
I just wanna let live on and forget
Give you the rest of my life

Any fool could see
You were meant for me
Girl, I just wanna be
With you, near you
Some fool is gonna try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Na na na na, na na, na na na
Early in the morning, babe

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
And I wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fool may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
I just wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
And I just want to be
Near you, with you
Some fool may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
I just wanna be
Near you, and with you
Some fool is gonna try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you
