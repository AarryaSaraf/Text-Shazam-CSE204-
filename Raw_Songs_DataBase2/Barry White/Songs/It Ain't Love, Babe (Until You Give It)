It ain't love babe
It ain't life babe
Give me your love babe
Live your life babe

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

"I love you" are three words
Often spoke but seldom heard
Girl you got to show it
You say you think it's love you feel
There's only one way to tell it's real
Girl, you got to know it

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, girl we can do no wrong
Come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

I know it's hip to just hang loose
I've had my share of all that too
Girl I want you
I just want you, to just want me
To share our love endlessly
Girl, don't you?

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, we can do no wrong
So come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Oh, live your life babe, I mean really live it

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, we can do no wrong
So come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

'Cause it ain't love babe, not until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

Na, na na, na na, na na...
(It ain't love babe)

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

'Cause it ain't love babe, until you give it
Girl, it ain't life babe, until you live it

Na, na na, na na, na na...
(It ain't love babe)
