Now getting back to you...

Baby, people all over the world every day
Is trying to find something new
Man putting man into space
In search of some new place
But I'll never, I'll never
Have to worry about leaving here, as...
As long as I've got you

(You're my high)
You're my high... and I swear
(I'll never let you go)
I'll never ever let you go

(You're my high)
Baby, you're my sky
(I keep comin' back for more)
You just keep me comin' back for more
It's you... (you're my high) it's you, baby
You're... (just wanna let you know)
Baby, you're so different

(You're my high)
Nothin' else in this world affects me
The way you do, only you
(It follows me wherever I go)
Everywhere I go, you're there
I just thought you might... like to know
