You know I never knew love could ever hurt this way
Baby, I never knew that a man could fall so deep in love this way
But baby there's so many things I don't know
And there's one thing that I wish I did know
Where is?
Where has our love gone?

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Where is the joy
The joy we used to know
How did we lose our love?
Where did our love go?
Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I, I... I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where love has gone
My darling, I... I don't know where love has gone
I don't know, guess I don't know, I don't know

I got to try
To make you understand
We've got to save our love
Undo it all again
Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Baby, you know what I feel like doing?
I feel like going out and buying me a one way ticket to anywhere
Just anywhere, I don't care

I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone

Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

I, I don't know where love has gone
Darling, I... I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't know...)
I, I don't know where love has gone
(Gotta believe it... One way ticket anywhere, I don't care)
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone
I, I don't know where love has gone...
