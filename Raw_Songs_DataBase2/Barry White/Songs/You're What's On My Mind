Make my night
Sho' you right
What this night holds for us?
Baby, only the angels in heaven can speak it
We'll embrace love like never before
Or anyone has ever known it

Baby, you're what's on my mind...
Heh, that's right, that's right! 
That's right, that's right

(I think about you all the time)
Woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo
I want you, I need you
Oh love, oh love, yeah yeah

(You're what's on my mind
I think about you all the time
I think about you every day)
Oh, yes I do!
(Love will make you feel brand new)

I can sense a feel, here and now
You're gonna give your love to me
Say kesu , won't you too
And so very , won't you marry me?

Come with me, and we'll share
Our sensual secret
Let's explore, open every door
Until we can't take anymore

Loving you, that's on my mind
I swear it's there
I think about it all the time
I, I... (awooo!)

I want to do it night and day
With you, to you
Love can make you feel that way

(You're what's on my mind)
There it is
(I think about you every day
Love will make you feel brand new...)
