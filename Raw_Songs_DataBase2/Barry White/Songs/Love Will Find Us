Patience
Always, be patient
The way we make love
We take our time
Really get into each others feelings
It takes time, to touch and feel
Hold and kiss and look
Takes time
And when you take your time
Make love in a very passionate way
You tend to enjoys so much more
We really have to be careful sweetheart
So many times if've seen people trying to rush
Certain thangs into their lives
Some plays in to delay a woman
Turnout to be a disaster
I've lived long enough to understand
All things comes in time
We must always nourish this relationship
Always spend being time together communicating and relating
Because nothings ever guarenteed, other then
Your gonna stay the colour you are
One day you'll die
Outside of that, nah
You have to work while you wait
And remember no matter what it is
Whether it's us
Something you want to achieve in your life
Baby if it's meant for you, for me, for us
We're gonna have it, you can believe
Whatever we achieve to it
Will come with time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other

It's very truth
Baby it's very real
It's life itself
No matter who you are, where you are
What's you trying to do in life
The same game applies to everyone
If you can see then and believe it
You can not do it, but it's harder
Take time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other

We're searching for something
Very, very special
And we have to keep working and searching
Searching working
All things in time

Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Lock in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other
