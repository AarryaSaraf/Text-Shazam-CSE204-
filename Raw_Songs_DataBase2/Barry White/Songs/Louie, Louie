Fine little girl, she wait for me
Me catch the ship for across the sea
I sail the ship all alone
I never think I make it home

Louie Louie, me gotta go

Three nights and days me sail the sea
Me think of girl, constantly
On the ship I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie Louie, me gotta go
Louie Louie, say me gotta go

Me see Jamaica moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I, I never leave again

Louie, say me gotta go
Louie Louie, me gotta go
Say me gotta go (Louie Louie)
