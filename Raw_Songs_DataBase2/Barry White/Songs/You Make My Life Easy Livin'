Ah, yeah...
You, you make my life
Easy livin'... ah
You, you make my life
Easy livin'... ah

Got my arms around you, babe
Squeezin' you tight
Showing you that I love you, babe
All through the night
Just touchin' you livens up, oh yeah
The spirit in me
Makin' me so thankful, babe
My tears run clear and free
Oh, I said...

You, you make my life
Easy livin'... oh, yeah
I say you, you make my life
Easy livin'... oh, yeah

Since we've been together, babe
Nothin' has changed
It's such a happy feelin', babe
There's nothin' to rearrange
Thank you boy for givin' me joy
Thank you boy for just lovin' me
Oh, I say...

You, you make my life
Easy livin'... oh, yeah
You, you make my life
Easy livin'... oh
I'm gonna lay here in your arms all day long
'Cause you, you make my life
Easy livin'... oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
