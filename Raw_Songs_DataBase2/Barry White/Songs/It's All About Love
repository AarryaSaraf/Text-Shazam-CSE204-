It's coming to you
It's gonna renew you
Welcome it in
Let it be your friend
Let it move you
Let it soothe you

Can't you hear it calling?
(Love)
Why are you stalling?
(Love)
Run to it fast
Don't you know it's gonna last
It has found you
Let it surround you

It's all about love... (love)
It's all about love... (love)
It's all about love... (love)
It's all about sweet love... (love)

You're hesitating
Why are you waiting?
Let it begin
Oh, yeah
Take it within
Let it move you
Let it soothe you

Will you share?
(Love)
Do you care?
(Love)

(Love)
(Love)

(Love)
(Love)
