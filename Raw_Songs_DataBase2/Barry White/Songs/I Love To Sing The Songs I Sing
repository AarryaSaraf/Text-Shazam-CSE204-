I've been around the world
Only to find
Love's universal language

And I knew it all the time

I love to sing the songs
The songs I sing
I sing the songs
I love to sing
I love to sing the songs
The songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing

This song is for
Is for everyone
I just wanna thanks
For all your time

I love to sing
The songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing

I love to sing the songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing
The songs I sing
I love to sing the songs I sing
And I sing the songs
I love to sing
