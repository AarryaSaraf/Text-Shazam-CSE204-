I love to talk to you, it's not every day that a man
Can find a woman that, that he just loves talking to
Different strokes for different folks
And you know what baby? That's very very very very true
We're into our own world, in our own way
Doin' our own thing
And I hope that you can
Truly truly understand what I'm trying to say to you right now
Because I think that it's very important that you know what
That you realize just what you are to me
You're not just another woman, you're not just another fling
You're not just another ego trip, you are my hope to die woman
Needing you is a part of what I feel for you
Wanting you is a part of what I feel for you
But loving you, baby that's all of me to you
I've been blessed, I swear to God I've been blessed
Because I've got you
And everything that I want to be
And everything that I have to be
And everything that I've got to be
It's all because of you baby, all because of you

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

Girl you're mine to love, to keep
I declare, I swear, you're so doggone sweet
To share your love alone with me
And give your love so tenderly
How lucky can I be, oh babe
My pretty little babe, oh babe oh no babe

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

To find a love like yours these days
I declare, I swear, ain't no way
Girl my world is at your feet
And a love so real and so complete
For eternity, oh babe
My precious little babe, mmmm oh no babe

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

Ah yeah, oh yeah, oh no

I can't believe girl that you want me
I can't believe that you want me
My darling, I I can't, girl I can't believe it, honey I can't believe it, girl I just can't believe it
I I can't I can't believe girl I just can't believe that you want me, you want me, yeah you want me, you want me
I can't believe that you want me, girl you want me
Every word of is true, baby I swear
And all that I own is for you
I can't I can't believe, girl I can't believe, honey I can't believe
Girl I can't believe
