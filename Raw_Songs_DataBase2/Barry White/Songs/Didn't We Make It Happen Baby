People in love are very special people to us
And we wanna let you know, that we're just like you
And sometimes, when two people fall in love
It isn't always easy, things don't always go just right
I mean, certain people will try and keep you
From being happy together
Yeah baby, they do more than try
Sometimes they, they really get in the way, but...
But I think, when two people really love each other
And really hold to life together
I think that, that they can endure
And they can overcome anything in the world
It's like a friend of ours once said:
"Life is for the living, and love is for the giving"

Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we

Our love together is so much better
Than they ever said it would
Mhm, we've stayed together through stormy weather
They didn't think we could, no
You fill my heart with love, oh boy
There's so much happiness and joy

Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we

It's really nice to have someone
Who's loving you this way, hey...
If people knew us, really knew us, they'd know
Just how much we believe the things we say
Girl, you're the reason I'm complete
You turned my bitter into sweet

Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby)

We've got the answer to our life
When things go wrong, we make them right

Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen)

Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever and ever and ever and ever
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)

Oh, oh! Yeah (Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Oh! (Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby...
