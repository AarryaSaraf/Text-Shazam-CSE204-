It's just not the same
You know what I mean when I say it's not the same
It's just not the same
Something has come between us
Something that's happening to us that I...
Baby that I just can't quite explain
I wanna sit down calmly and try and talk about it
Because I can't seem to find the reason why we're, we're drifting apart
Ya dig?

When I make love to you
You don't react anymore
You lay there like you don't care
You never did that before
How am I supposed to feel? what should I do?
What if it wasn't me, but you?
What would you do?

If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
Ooooooh
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby

Is this the way you're tryin' to say you don't want me
I hope it's not, you're all I've got
With you I wanna be
You're all I'm living for, you know it's true
What if it wasn't me, but you?
What would you do?

If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right, right now, right, right, right now
Right, right, right, right now
Right now, right now
If you know

Ooooh
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me right now baby
Right now, right now
If you know, won't you tell me
Tell me now, tell, tell me now
Tell me now, right now, right now

If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't, won't you tell me
Right, right now
Right now, right now baby
If you know, won't you tell me
Right now, right now
Right now baby
If you know, if you know
