It's remarkable, it's incredible, it's unbelieveable, isn't it?
Just a few hours ago, we... we had no idea that we would meet this way
And I'm not gonna waste any time getting to the point
Because I know what you want, and you know what I want
And together we both want the same thing
I like you... and you like me

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Just us two
Alone to find
Dreams can come true

Honesty is the best policy
I just wanna say, that I've got this insane thing for you
A yearning inside of me
Something's burning inside of me

I like you
You like me
Can this be true?
Can you see what I see?

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone and free
To share our fantasies

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone to find
Dreams can come true

I want you
You want me
In our lives
Can you see what I see?

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone to find
Baby, dreams can come true

I like you
You like me
Can this be true?
Can you see what I see?

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone and free
To share all our fantasies

I like you
You like me
Oh, what a lovely night...
This has turned out to be

Just you and me
Girl, we're gonna share all our fantasies
You and me
Forever
Forever, oh

You know, I like you too
