Love song, love song
We've tried everything, let's...
What about love, what about love?

The words I have to say
They will be simple, but they're true (yeah)
Until you give your love
There's nothing more than we can do

Love is the  goal
And love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more

Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean? (...know, what I mean? oh lord)
Have your eyes really seen? (Have your eves really seen?)
(Do you know, what I mean?)
Do you know, what I mean?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Have your eyes really seen?)
Have your eyes really seen?
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say it's very hard
To live the life that we once knew (well)
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn (turn it!)
Truth is the frame we must find (bring it up!)
And freedom's the lesson we must learn

Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know (do you know, what I mean?) what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? (Have your eyes really seen?)
Do you know (do you know, what I mean?) what I mean?
Have your eyes (have your eyes really seen?) really seen?
(Do you know, what I mean?)
Gotta give it up!
Do you...
(Have your eyes really seen?)
If you wanted to get it all, you gotta give it up!
Do you know, what I mean?
Gotta give it up!
If you want it, you gotta give it up!
Have your eyes really seen?

I remember Kentucky 

Do you know what I mean, what I mean
Have your eyes really seen, really seen
Do you know, what I mean?
Gotta give it up!
If you wanna get away, you gotta give it up!
Have your eyes really seen?
Have your eyes...
