Well, yeah
Well... yeah...

As I walk through the city
Oh, what a shame and a pity
People don't believe in dreams anymore
Unlike they did before

Dreams are made for people who
Who believe that dreams come true
All our fantasies can be
Reality

Dreams are made for us to grow
When you find them, don't let go
On my mind I always dream
I'll find love in you

Oh, I believe in miracles (oh lord)
Like a bird that flies, that files
And I believe, any goal can be achieved
Only if it takes you and I

Living in peace is our power
The light of truth will guide our way, each day
Commitment will survive, any day the music thrives
Only... if we believe in dreams-

-are made for people who
Who believe, that dreams come true
All our fantasies can be
Reality

Dreams were made for those who know
When you find it, don't let go
All my live I always knew
I'll find love in you

Dreams, dreams...
