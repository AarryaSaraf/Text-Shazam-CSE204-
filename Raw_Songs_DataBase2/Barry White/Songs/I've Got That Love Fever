I, I've got that love fever
I mean that real fever
That real deal fever

I, I've got that love fever
That burning up fever
Can't get enough fever

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

Oh I, I've got that love fever
That body sweat fever
That Rated-X fever

Your touch of fire starts my flame
Inviting me to your love game
Hot blood is blazing
Intensities are raging

You provoke me, oh baby
The way you stroke me, my baby
I feel your body heat
That makes me feel so weak
You make me feel so weak
You make by body freak

I, I've got that love fever
I mean that real fever
That real deal fever

Said I, I've got that love fever
That burning up fever
Can't get enough fever

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

Said I, I've got that love fever
That hot enough fever
That burning stove fever

In your eyes, it's love I see
Arousing me to my highest degree
Hot fun is waiting
Intensities are raging

You provoke me, my baby
The way you stroke me, oh baby
You make me feel so weak
I feel your body heat
I feel your body heat
That makes my body freak

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

Oh I, I've got that love fever
That burning up fever
I can't get enough fever

Said I...
Fever
Fever
Fever!

Said I, got that love fever
The real fever
Real deal fever

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

I, fever, in the morning
Fever, fever, can't keep it
Fever, in the midnight hour
Fever, can't stand that hour...
