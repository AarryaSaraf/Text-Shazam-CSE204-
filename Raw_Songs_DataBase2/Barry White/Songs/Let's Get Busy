This is the only way to start the night
Let's start the play
Buck style, buck wild
Now is the perfect time
For what's mine is yours, what's yours is mine
Buck wild, buck style

You've set the mood, I'll set the pace
Come close to me girl, I know the way

Ooh-ooh wee! Come on, let's get busy, baby
You and me ahh come on and work me, girl
Move and groove, oh you know can work it, baby
Me and you, ahh you know you can do it, girl

The music jams, and baby here we go
Come with the fire, come with the flow
Buck sweet, buck freak
You move your body like a reptile
I love the way you look, let's pump it up awhile
Buck jam, buck slam

This feels so good inside of me
You really know just what I need

Ooh-ooh wee! Come on, let's get busy, baby
You and me ahh come on and work me, girl
Move and groove, come on let's get busy, baby
Me and you, come on, you know you can do it, girl

Me and you, come on, you know you can do it, girl
Ooh-ooh wee! Come on, let's get busy
You and me, oh I know you can work it down
Move and groove, I know you can do it, baby
Me and you, come on let's get busy, baby
Let's get busy...
