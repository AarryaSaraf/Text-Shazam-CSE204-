Yesterday, I felt so good inside
The joy you gave
The love me made
Fulfilled my life
Today, I'm alone
Without you dear
There's no life here
I can't go on

You're all that I
I'm thinking of
I just can't forget
The way it was
Happy times were yours and mine
Now misery is all I see
Don't let it be
Oh, darling please

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away

I'd give the world
And all I own
For one moment
That we have known
It's strange
How you changed
Yet, I've remained
In love with you
I still feel the same

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Yeah

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
