Hey, you know I don't, I don't really give a damn
If it would have took forever, I would have waited, baby
And waited and waited and waited and waited and waited

I, oh yeah, um, baby love

I knew that everything will be alright
It had to work out sweet, my love at night
Ah, the two of us in love together
Henceforth, now and forever

We've only just begun to feel the fire grow
Our light of love will burn and let the people know
That we intend to make it, when trouble comes, we'll shake it
My love for you can no one take it, oh, lord, I just got to say it

Girl, well, we finally made it, my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh, my love, well, we finally made it
My, my, oh my, girl, you don't know
How long I've waited

Ooh, love, ah, my love, my, my
My love, my, my
Ooh, love
What would I do without you?

Nothing in this world could stop us now
We're going to make it, yeah, someway, somehow
So  to you and me
Let's keep our love happy and free
Free from all the hurt and pain, oh, I gotta say it again

Ooh love, girl, we finally made it, girl, my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh love, well, we finally made it
Girl, my, oh, my, ah, you don't know
Girl, you don't know how long I've waited

Ooh love, well, we finally made it, girl my, oh, my
Ah, you don't know how long I've waited
Ooh, love, well, we finally made it
My, oh, my, girl, you don't know
How long I've waited

Ooh, love, my, oh, my
Ooh, love, my, oh, my
Ooh, love, my, oh, my
