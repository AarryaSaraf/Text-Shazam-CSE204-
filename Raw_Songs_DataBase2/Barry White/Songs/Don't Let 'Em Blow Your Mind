Beware of their strange, funky games and thangs
Beware of the sly, the slick, and the wicked
Don't let 'em blow your mind

Don't let 'em, don't let 'em, don't let 'em...

They use tricks and games
And funny little things
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Keep your eye on your star
You know who you are
And don't wanna waste your time

They use tricks and schemes
To shatter all your dreams
But don't let 'em blow your mind
You hold the key to unlock your destiny
And you do it all in time

They use tricks and spoons
And little round baloons
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay in to yourself
There's nobody else
On that you can rely

When you touch the Moon
Sing a little tune
For me
You're free
To fly 
High
Ride the wind
To the very end
You'll see
You're free
To fly 
High

Pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Di-ah
Pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Di-ah

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah

They use tricks and strange
Little, funny money games
But don't let 'em blow your mind
You know you can't be bought
Not a penny for your thoughts
And that's your bottom line

They use tricks and bombs
And little, funny guns
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Just take a little look
Inside a history book
And you won't believe what you'll find

They use tricks, and friends
Will try to do you in
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay cool, be strong
Keep moving right along
And leave the madness behind

When you touch your Moon
Sing a little tune
For me
You're free
To fly 
High
You can ride the wind
To the very end
You'll see
You're free
To fly
High

They use tricks and games
And funny little things
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay in to yourself
There's nobody else
On that you can rely

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
