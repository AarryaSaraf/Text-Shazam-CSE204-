Time has always taught us, that most things are...
Are subject to change
But there's something mystical and magical about
Two people, and that thang they call love
No matter what comes and goes, that will always be the same

Mexico! ...ico!

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the fundamental things still apply
As time goes by
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-o-oes by

Moonlight and love songs (love songs) will never be out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate (oh no, no)
A woman needs man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's something (something) no one (no one) can deny (no one can deny!)

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goooes by
Ai-ai-ai-ay
Ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay-ay

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Moonlight and love songs, will never be out of date (oh love)
And hearts full of passion (oh yeah, yeah), jealousy and hate (oh yeah, yeah)
A woman needs a man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's still (still), still (still) to this day

So we must remember this
Love, a kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

As time goes by
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-oes by
And that's forever (forever)
And that's forever (forever)
And that's for... ever
And that's forever, ever
It's still the same old story (still the same old story)
Everybody fights for love and glory (fights for love and glory)
And that's for... ever

...ico! Let's go!

As time goes by...
