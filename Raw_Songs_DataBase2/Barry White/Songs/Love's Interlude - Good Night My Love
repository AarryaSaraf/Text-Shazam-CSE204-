What are you doing?
I was thinkin' about you and I I had to call
People sometimes disagree, feelings get hurt
I want you to know I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings
Or to make you sad and that I'm glad we got it all straightened out
And that's why I'm calling now, because
I want you to know how much I really appreciate, how much I really love you
No matter what happens in this world, I will always be there for you, always
Because I know that I will never feel this way with no one ever again
That I've got to do everything in my power to make sure that you understand
That I that I really really love you

Good night, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go there's just one thing I really need to know
Is your love girl still warm for me or has it grown cold
If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I care please give your love to me dear

Good night my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

If you should awake in the stillness of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I do care so please give your love to me dear

Ohh good night, my love take it easy
Pleasant dreams and stay right, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Good night
