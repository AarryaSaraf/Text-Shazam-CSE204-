Hi baby, come on in
Let me take your coat
I've got some nice white wine
Lovely music

Re... lax, baby to the max
Get comfortable, yeah
And just love me (just relax)
To the max
Baby you don't need anything
But me... oooh

I want you
And you want me too
Take your time
(Take your time, take your time)
Relax your mind
Really all you need
Is just you and me

Now is the time
For you and me
Forever (together)
So relax... to the max
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh...
