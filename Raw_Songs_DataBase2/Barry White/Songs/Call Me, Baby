Sometimes, you... you can get lonely sitting by yourself
And I want you to know something, baby. I want you to know, that...
That I'm always only a phone call away
Whenever you're alone, pick up your phone and call me
Whenever you're in need, you can call me, just call me

Sometimes I sit alone in my room
And all I can think of is you
If you could see how freaky I'd be
I know you'd get freaky too

You're like a ball that's chained to my lump 
Girl, I'm the hand that fits in your glove
That's why I need you so
I want you to know

There's something about you
Girl, you stay on my mind
Maybe I'm in love with loving you
When you need me, baby...

Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me, baby

I don't have a pot of gold
Fortune or fame to share with you
You better believe you can count on me
For whatever you want me to do

It's my desire to set your soul on fire
Your whole life through
That's why I need you so
I want you to know

There's something about you
Girl, you stay on my mind
Maybe I'm in love with loving you
When you need me, baby...

Call me
Call me
Call me
Baby, call me

Well, oh yeah

Call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Baby, call me

Call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Oh yeah, call me

Baby, call me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, call me
Call me
Baby, call me
Call me
