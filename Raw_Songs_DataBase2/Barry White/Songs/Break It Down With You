(Breaking down)
Give me your hand, real slow
(Breaking down)
Touch me here, touch me there (Breaking down)
Right there, keep it, work it
This is  love
Baby I, I want you

I, I, I never been this high (I've never)
Hot love glows inside (Baby)
I know we can agree, oh baby
'Cause love is all we need, hmmmm

Feel so good, feel so fine pretty thang
I wanna break it down to you, I wanna break down with you
I wanna break down to you, I wanna break down with you

I, I've never touched the sky (Never) ever
So let's give love a try (Try it, let's do it)
Your eyes tell me I should move (Baby) on you
Girl, 
And 

It feels so good, it feels so fine
Breaking down
You see I wanna break it down to you
I wanna break down with you
I wanna break down to you, I wanna break down with you
It feels so good, it feels so fine
Breaking down

Love, let's make love
What we give for
Sweat, we're so wet
This seditious love making
Oh baby, I love the way you look to me
Over and over and over

Feels so good, it feel so fine
Breaking down

This is so good, so good
It's so fine, breaking down
