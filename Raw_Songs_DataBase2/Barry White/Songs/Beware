I love your style
And I love your smile
I love the way you talk
It's so exiting the way you walk
Beauty is in high when I hold you baby
And I want you to know that all I see is you
And what I see, I like
Girl listen, you're in my life, so:
Beware, I'm gonna get you
Take care, I can't resist you (your touch)
I love you too much
Better beware
I need you, and want you to know dear
I swear I do
I really do dear (your touch)
I love you too much
So beware
I'm not a king on a thrown, no more
No treasures do I own
But if I had your love
I know I'd be
The richest man in history
So beware
I'm gonna get you so take care
Cause I can't resist you (your touch)
I want you too much
So beware
I'm not a king on a thrown, no more
No treasures do I own
But if I had your love
I know I'd be
The richest man in history
So beware
I'm gonna get you so take care
Cause I can't resist you (your touch)
I love you too much
I want you to know
That I love you so
So beware
