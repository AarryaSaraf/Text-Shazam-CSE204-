A great lady once, once asked us to reach out and touch
Somebody's hand, and make this world a better place, if you can
I know we can... because we, and we alone, possess the power
The power to reach out and touch physically
The power to reach out and touch spiritually
The power to reach out and touch mentally
We need to share, we need to care
(No, no no...)
Remember, this is just a reminder

Don't forget, remember (don't forget)
Everyone's a star (don't forget)
The color of your skin won't change, my friend (don't forget)
Remember who you are

And don't forget, remember (don't forget)
We're gonna reap just what we sow, oh (don't forget)
If we don't plant the seed of love (don't forget)
Can we expect for love to grow?

Yes, I'm White
And I'll do my share
Because I care
To make it right
My skin is red
And vision of peace and harmony
Still echoes in my head

Remember who is watching you
Remember, remember, remember
Be careful what you say and do
Remember who is watching you

Don't forget the hopeless (don't forget)
And don't forget the weak (don't forget)
People suffering everywhere (don't forget)
Living in the cold, cold streets

Don't forget the hungry (don't forget)
A child hungers with pain (don't forget)
If we can't feed the children (don't forget)
Then God made men in vain

Don't forget the ones who love you (don't forget)
Do you know, what I speak of? (don't forget)
It's not just about people giving life, no (don't forget)
It's about giving life and love
Remember

Remember, time is precious (don't forget)
And time won't wait on you (don't forget)
Good things come to those who wait, yeah (don't forget)
But you gotta make them all come true

Na na na, na na...
Oh lord, na na na...

My skin is brown
And there's a few things I'd like to help change
If we get it now
I'll take 10 steps up, not one step back
I live to give, by the way: I'm black

Remember who is watching you
(Remember who is watching you)
Be careful what you say and do
(Be careful what you say and do)

We need to love, we need to care
We need to reach out everywhere
We need to give, we need to share
God made it all for us
And gave it all to us

Don't forget the power (don't forget)
That guides you day by day (don't forget)
Never take life for granted, never (don't forget)
Just live life all the way
Forever

And don't forget, remember (don't forget)
Everyone's a star (don't forget)
But the color of your skin won't change, my friend (don't forget)
Remember who... you are

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Can you remember that?
Remember, don't forget, don't forget
Yeah remember, remember, remember...
