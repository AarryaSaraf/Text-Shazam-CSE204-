Can you still remember how it all began?
With clipper ships and pink electric trees
Dawnlight on a skyline bridges' span
Street light on a rooftop memory
Then it was me and spring came
Playing a song of spring rain
A melody in your name
Night now comes much bluer than it used to be
The pink nun sings much sadder than before
She sings that sometimes things aren't what they
Seem to be, like moons reflected on the sixteenth floor
Love is no more, it's ended
Paper and pins won't mend it;
Even the moon pretended
There must be a reason, oh, there must be one
Keep your answers, let me find my own
Where do pretty stories get their endings from
If loving always leaves you all alone?
Kisses have shown me sorrow;
Love is a throne to borrow;
Pay for the loan tomorrow
