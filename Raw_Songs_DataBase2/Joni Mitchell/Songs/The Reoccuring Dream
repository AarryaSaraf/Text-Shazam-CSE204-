This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between
What we have now
And what we wish we could have

More fulfilling and less frustrating!

Out of the envy in our eyes
Look!
Glamorous picture people rise
Radiant!
Gleaming down from screens and pages

Ooh glamour before your very eyes!

Isn't it true isn't it true?
Good question I know who cares
Look here they tell you
If you had this
If you had that
Latest styles and colors
If we had that for us mmm
Wouldn't it be fabulous

If you had that house car bottle jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars movie stars movie stars
Order your youth secrets of the stars
Call now just $9.99

Our discontent is their delight
They offer relief for the purchase price
Love in a bottle
Love on four wheels
Is that our new car, Charles?

Isn't it true isn't it true?
We guarantee it. Pick up your phone and dial
See here they sell you
If you had this
If you had that
I want a new truck! More power!
If you use this shampoo
True love will come to you

If you had that house car bottle jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars movie stars movie stars
Hollywood's greatest legends
