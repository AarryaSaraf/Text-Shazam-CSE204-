// I Will Kill You //

Bleed for my pain
Revenge on treacherous snakes
They will pay

Slicing the flesh
Sculptured wounds my catharsis
I will stain

Into the heart
Needle injects gasoline
Convulsions

The one that they betrayed
Has made them this way

Plagued by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage

Scream at my face
The grisly scars went unavenged
Until now

Deep in the hole
You are not gagged and scream aloud
But unheard

Choke on your vomit
You watch your hands cut off
Then your legs

The one that you betrayed
Will kill you this way

Scarred by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
I must kill you

Into the throat
The scalpel slices
Warm blood sprays out
The gushing entices

Pull out your heart
And let you watch
Shove in your mouth
Then stab your crotch

I watch your agony

I am released
From years of pain
Your death averted
My becoming insane
You are dead

I have killed you

// Disposal Of The Body //

The basement incinerator
Is where they'll put the head
Hose the floor and clean the room
Anywhere they bled

Into boxes go the bags
Fill the space with rocks
In the dark of night
He throws them off the docks

Rotting in the river
Never to be found
Under tons of concrete
Deep beneath the ground

From behind he grabs his mouth
The blade goes to his neck
Bulging veins pumping blood
He struggles to protect

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life
Hang the corpse - Prepare to drain the blood

Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife
Carve the corpse - Dissect him in the tub

Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones
With a crowbar - scrape off all tattoos

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Chunks of a skull
Sawn in half bones
Body is found
Killer unknown

// Sentenced To Burn //

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Burning the world
And all of it's life
Throwing all the people
In a pit of fire

Watching the sheep
Gathering to die
Followers in life
Follow to the grave

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

Burning flesh
Miasma of their death
Civilisation
It is destroyed

Pits of corpses
Unholy grave of war
Hanging victims
Guilty of free thought

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

War of fire shred their souls
Burn in hell doomsday's toll
Failed to see the trap they laid
Demagogues lead them into the flames

[Solo - Owen]

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

// Blood Drenched Execution //

Blood Drenched Execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Feel the fucking pain
I rip your child from your cunt
The fetus is kept alive
To die before caring eyes

Slaves in hell for me
A tortured death will set you free
The executioner
I was meant to be
Born to kill for all eternity

The exsanguination
Savage display of murder and mayhem
Casualities of primal abduction
Red is spraying from
The hole in the baby's head
The slaughter will not subside
This day a family dies

Young blood is so pure
Unborn infant is dead premature
The executioner
Has to mutilate
A fetal pulp is all that remains

Rapid blood loss
Flooding the floor
Gore is unstoppable
Rabid blood lord
Carving the whore
Extremely contemptible
Rancid rancor
Insatiable from my proclivity
Random tirade
Eternal death inevitable

[Solo - O'Brien]

Blood drenched execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Felt the fucking pain
I ripped our child from your cunt
The fetus was kept alive
To die before blood soaked eyes

// Gallery Of Suicide //

Into the abyss, perpetual and torturous
The gallery of suicide, internal torment
Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy
Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed

Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads
Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks
Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away
The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death

Darkness is the only light, suicide the way
Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay
Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display

Pain never felt
Enslaved inside this massive grave
Life, evil fate
Only slaves to death can survive this place
Die, perdition
Penance in putrid decadence
Dead miscreants
Enter the decrepit necropolis

Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir
Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured
Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor

Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary
Vile tragedy
With great vehemence the hapless died
Kill, suicide
Serrated blades assist in destiny

Death opened the gallery
Sarcophagus
Ecstasy in suffering
Imprecation

[Solo - Owen]

Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary

// Dismembered And Molested //

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate
Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate

Entrails slip through my fingers
As I sift through her innards
My body rigid with goose bumps
My erection growing stronger
I put my cock into the carcass
My climax can wait no longer
Expectorate my seed of hate
Onto her mutilated corpse

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate

Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled

// Unite The Dead //

Her flesh decaying she rises to see
Lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
Her breasts are lactating blood and pus
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
Grasping her flesh, erotic undead
Maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
Into her cunt, rigid like rock

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Breeding the damned
Carcasses writhe
Revel in death

Bleeding and sore
Insatiable corpse
Consummate the bonds of death

Beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
Her body contorts, her vagina has fangs
Purtid fluids will mix in her loins
The seed of the undead will grow inside

Hiding from mankind the embryo grows
Nourished by flesh the mother consumes
After the birth the child will grow
Prince of the dead conceived by profanity

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Gifted with speech
The offspring will lead
Establish their reign

Lusting for flesh
But living, not dead
The corpses will rape
Rape!

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own

Lust of the dead will multiply
Thousands of corpses beginning to rise
Living again for rape and destruction
Ejaculate bile from their erections

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create whore of their own

[Solo - Owen]

Kingdom of rot the Bastard will rule
Stinking of death, zombies will roam
Through the whore the world was crushed
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Licentious masses rejoicing in sin
Larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
The rancid bodies will copulate
Their barren world they repopulate

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

// Stabbed In The Throat //

As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
I thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to death
A twelve inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain
Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head
Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered
Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
I am revitalized

Odium, embedded in my skull

To kill and eat your prey a way of nature
The taste of death must consciously be savored
My cannibal existence never dangered
Just look into my eyes

Subjugate, intensity to blame

Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds
Knife to the gullet results in cessation

[Solo - O'Brien]

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

// Chambers Of Blood //

Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt

Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge

Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding

Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity

Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
The stamina of the condemned

Disembowel
Torn apart
Heaving lungs
Severed tongues

Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt

Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life

Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid

// Headless //

Drawn to an act of complete domination
Violent urges of decapitation
Premeditated murder, invidious
Soon she will be vanquished, insidious

Headless
Headless
Headless

Abscission of her head is what I'm craving
I will become her homicidal savior

Headless
Headless
Headless
Headless

Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain
Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain

Preparing for medieval demise
A make-shift guillotine out of burcher knives
I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos
Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes

She finally enters my dwelling of sin
It'll be done in a matter of minutes
As I embrace her for one last single time
In horror I realize, death is mine

I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
The blood spews incessantly, flooding my face
Convulsions and spasms as life fades away
Ironically, I'm the one with no head

Headless
Headless

// Every Bone Broken //

Die, shattered you'll die
Bones broken in half
Blood flowing freely
Limbs severed in hate
Brains splattered, demise
Skin eaten in wrath
Eyes ripped from your head
Lie shattered, you die

For believing you could be free
Weakness only invigorates me
These broken bones once yours, I hold
Cause of death will never unfold

Torn, mangled, and maimed
Life withers away
In hellish decay
Bones shattered, you die

For not seeing things I see
Your pummeled body strengthens me
These broken bones keep me aware
Of how I lust to shred and tear

Every bone broken is my only goal
Sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs
Every bone broken, your truculent toll
Succumbling to my offensive demeanor
Every bone broken enhances my soul
Your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot
Every bone broken, your life I stole
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught

[Solo - O'Brien]

The snapping and cracking of skeletal remains
The pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh
The feeling of power from crushing your skull
The stench of decay overwhelming my brain

I slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt
Not a trace of proof that you ever existed
Pure satisfaction through what I have accomplished
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught

// Centuries Of Torment //

Generations
Denying penance
Eternal life reborn
Time and time again
Deny
Salvation
I refuse it
I will not be saved
Return to human form
Murder

Heartless
Bestial
I kill
Without
Pity for victims with untrue gods
My instinct will push beyond
Feelings like guilt, remorse or mercy
My flesh holds a soul of

Generations
Denying virtue
Eternal hate reborn
Time and time again
Defy
Redemption
Spit upon it
My soul they cannot claim
Return to kill again
Butcher

Unclean
Spirit
Searching
Hunting
Another life to maim and kill
A beast with brutal will
Lifetimes spent on a quest for blood
And with my death it does not end

Evil reborn for eternity
Centuries of torment

I will not be saved

[Solo - O'Brien]

When I die
They beg me to repent
I refuse

I return
The past forgotten but evil innate
They have lost

They will not be saved
They will die

// Crushing The Despised //

Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face
Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised

Under my boot I hear your bones crack
So many things that you want to take back
I won't forget and I won't forgive
Not so long as I allow you to live

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised
