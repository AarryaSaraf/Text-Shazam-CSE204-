Album: TheWretchedSpawn

// Severed Head Stoning //

Buried waist deep gagged and bound
Piles of heads lie on the ground
Executioners start to assemble

Condemed man shakes with fear
Doom now becoming clear
The faces of the heads he resembles

Severed
Head
Stoning

His family's head strike him
The most recent victims
Without mercy savage killers throw

His wife's head breaks his jaw
Bruised flesh becoming raw
From many wounds blood begins to flow

When the victim dies
They chop off his head

Severed head stoning

Bady beaten, in a daze
Eye pops out, fluids spray
Pulsing veins cause the wounds to gush

The end is near the bloody stumps
Mangeld face a mass of lumps
What was now a man reduced to mush

Mashed into a pulp
Dozens of bones break

[Solo - Jack Owen]

Severed head stoning

// Psychotic Precision //

Horrific perception that enters the brain
An abnormal psyche insanity's brain
Cemented beyond immeasurable doubt
Psychotic or not they need a way out

Of their obscured minds
If they want to be set free
Lunatics of wrath
Horrid killing viciously

Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical

In hell they will find
It is where they need to be
Murder redefined
Butchered meticulously

Killed the same way
On the same day
Various deaths
Identical

Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision, Psychotic precision
Psychotic precision

[Solo Jack Owen]

Aware not of the cruel visions each had
To slaughter alike they must truely be mad
Rewarded with blood on their ignorant hands
These psychos precisely slew many men

With their obscure minds
Feeling that they were set free
Murder redefined
Butchered meticulously

Like incisions
With conviction
Various deaths
Identical
Killed the same way
On the same day
Abysmal deaths
Imperceptible

// Decency Defied //

Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie by the side
Worn on my body or put on display

You mark your skin it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather

Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied

Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn apart
With my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts

You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather

Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied

To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine

I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind

[Solo - Jack Owen]

Ignoring your cries
Exposing your insides
Violence defined

Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display

You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied

// Frantic Disembowelment //

Intestines exposed
By violent thrusts
The innards removes
Dissecting the guts
To rip through the skin
Tissue and muscle
Cartilage shredding
Draining blood vessels

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Flesh matters the most
When splattered around
Its never morose
Absurdly profound
Fresh insides come out
Excitedly done
My purpose in life
To kill just for fun

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Frantic disembowelment
Deprived of vital content
Organ loss without consent
Spastic slicing an event
Sharpened steel my covenant
Frantic disembowelment
Mutilating miscreant
Sickening accomplishment
Spreading gore is time worth spent
Perpetuate this mad intent
Eternally malevolent
Frantic disembowelment

Kidneys exposed
The pancreas flew
Stomach deleted
The spleen I did chew
The carving is over
You lost and I won
Fulfilling my dream
I killed you for fun

Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes

Frantic disembowelment

// The Wretched Spawn //

Conceived through rape, procreate, a vicious brood
Ravaging intercourse, penetrate with force
Forsaken, nude

Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inherently vile

Inherited traits, reprobate from birth an urge
No chance to change, born deranged
Violence will emerge

Spawn of the wretched, born of the rape
Dawn of the murdering beasts of hate
Spawn of the wretched cunt defiled
Pawn of the darkness, blasphemous child
The wretched spawn, inherently vile

Spawn of the wretched, bred from the damned
Gone are the instincts normal of man
Spawn of the wanton loins of the cruel
Spawned by brute force used as a tool
The wretched spawn, violence will rule

Heredity dictates brutality
Groomed to carry the legacy
Genres of the butchers, a killing breed
Revel in making the helpless breed

Scion of the murders, a bloodline so profance
Born insane, predestined to annihilate
Throughout sinister eugenics, sworn to kill, they will

It was made to kill, massacre the innocents
A slaughter without meaning
Bleed, screaming, only one remains untouched
Her fate is violation, vile, impregnation

// Cyanide Assassin //

Staking out the residence of the chosen target
Entering the empty home, lace the food with poison
The hapless victim never had a chance
Precise contamination killed him fast

Shocking news traveled fast
But I have traveled faster
The only clue that's left behind
Poison in the cadaver

Cyanide assassin is my trade
Executing methods are my quarry's bane
Toxic killing tactics stop your breath
Precision dosage leaves the victim dead, cyanide assassin

Life, my task to end, death, I don't regret
Analyze the next assignment
Select the proper tools
Gas will be the most effective, that is what I'll use

Release the vapors in the victims room
Sleeping chambers fast become a tomb
Calculated venting should work fast
Enclosed space filled with poison gas, cyanide assassin

Life, it should end fast, death, he now should pass
Gasping, he fights for air, face fixed with despair
But the end does not seem close, misjudged the lethal dose
I must return, my work's not done, he's still alive but too weak to run

A sloppy job must be finished
Can't leave him in a coma
With my mask I won't smell
The almond like aroma

With syringe in hand I walk into his room
He's struggling with the damage from the fumes
I plunge the needle deep into his vein
Completion of the murder ends his pain, cyanide assassin

// Festering In The Crypt //

Eyes tied tight forever
Mouth wired shut forever
Body parts dissever. You will see no more
Never....

Lowered into the ground
You will never hear another sound
In your coffin you are bound. Underground
Forever

To the earth you're now enslaved, to the creatures long depraved
Flesh has now turned to grey, as the larve gnaw away
As you rot in your smallish tomb, insects care not how you met your doom
In your casket eternally lie. Many were pleased to see you die

Fester
In the
Crypt where
You lie

Victims
Pass by
They watched
You die

Flesh melts off your frame. Infamous was your name
Years passed since you moved on
Nothing left but carry on
Festering in the crypt

// Nothing Left To Mutilate //

As I walk behind her, her scent trails to me
What is it that draws me neared, what could it be?
Once I was normal among the sheep
Now I'm immortal, in the night I creep

Searching for the one, 21, she will run, from the gleam of my blade, she has strayed
She will pay, with the only life that she now knows
Captured by the gender she loathes

Now she is tied, terrified, set aside
As I prepare she stares as I tear at the garment she hides behind
Her young flesh is so divine

One final deed, she will plead, I proceed
Satisfying my urge, I will scourge, as I surge through her hallowed feminine domain
From her young body. I can't abstain

Lifeless she now lies, now untied I defile
Carefully scoring her skin I begin from within
Removing her organs inspected
Still nothing detected

[Solo - Jack Owen]

One way to achieve
The info that I need
Continuing to cleave

[Solo - Jack Owen]

Gradually consumed
She was foredoomed
Body one big wound

Now I am through as I chew on the few pieces that remain
Of the brain, nothing gained, I continue my
Searching in the night for the one who fulfills my plight

Searching for the one, 21, she will run from the gleam of my blade, she will pay
Nothing left to mutilate
Nothing left to mutilate

[Solo - Jack Owen]

// Blunt Force Castration //

Smash his scrotum sac
Altered ferociously
Survived this attack
Sterile now left to bleed

Emptied in the crotch
Gonads reduced to pulp
Hateful remedy
Void of sexuality

Sledgehammer destroys
Groin, tattered and maimed

Emasculate
Crushing the testicles fast
Debilitate
Cutting off the penis last

Macerate, deforming
Enervate, Caponized

Detached genitals
Mangled between the thighs
Gelded painfully
Transformed before his eyes

Blood spews everywhere
Deprived of virility

Sledgehammer destroys
Groin, tattered and maimed

Inactivate
She crushed the testicles fast
Disintegrate
She cut off the penis fast

Macerate, deforming
Enervate, Caponize

Blunt force castration
Giving life is done
Blunt for castration
De sexualized
Blunt force castration

Macerate, deforming
Enervate, Caponized

Smash his scrotum sac
Altered ferociously
Survived this attack
Sterile now left to bleed

Hateful remedy
Void of sexuality

Sledgehammer destroys
Castrated with blunt force

// Rotted Body Landslide //

Climbing the mounds to escape from death
Ten thousand left to rot
In this gorge

Bodies lie
Putrefy
I wont die

Suffocating stench of corpse's waft
Up from the bits of deaths
Fumes disgorge

Rancid heap
Walls steep
Vapors creep

Underneath
Putrid tide
Rotted body
Land

Slide
Genocide
Mountains of dead mark the place where they died, they died

Transfixed with horror as the corpses fall
Flesh sloughs off as I try to grasp
Start to slip

Suffocate
Corpses weight
Steals my fate

Underneath
Putrid one
Rotted body
Land

Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside

Slide
Genocide
Mountains of the dead mark the place where they died
They died

Bodies of the dead
Smother me with rot
Remains are crushing me
Decomposing mound

This is where I die
Nameless dead my witness

Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside

// Slain //

The outlander walked into town, covered in gore
He knew he could not wait much longer, he needed more
Death
Pain
Terror
Blood...

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all time

Wasting no time he began defiling whores
He would be the last man they felt, a carnivore
Tear
Rape
Ravage
Maim

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one knows
Their bloodstains will always show for all time

Firing, loaded rifle, never ending killing spree
Slashing with machete, body parts are the debris
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One more town, slowly going down
This is the coming of endless torment

[Solo - Jack Owen]

Unburied victims lie, blood soaking into the sand
Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the fullest extent
One man left, sheriff bereft, faces the stranger with intent

[Solo - Pat O'Brien]

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all...
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die

On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always show for all...
Slain

// Bent Backwards And Broken //

Twisting limbs untill they break
Contortions wrenching pain

Joints are hyperextended
Opposite
Fibrous tendons snap
Bent
Backwards and broken

Hateful physical control
Opposite ways
Elbows bend and pop
Fingers cracking
Connective tissue torn

Unrelenting warping strain
Knees are shattered
Sinew ripped from bone
Ankles give way

Back is arching
Spinal pressure builds
Total collapse

Predacious entanglement, form is distorted
Grotesque rearrangement, body contorted

Splintering bones causing internal bleeding
Abundance of injuries, pain is exceeding

Every joint in the body is turned the wrong way
A debt to the nemesis forcibly paid

Arching the back
Vertebrae crack
Fracture the spine
Can't realign

[Solo Jack Owen]

Torque on the neck
Structure is wrecked
Amorphous blob
An end to macabre

A torturous lesson in physical terms
The only way some people learn
Stretching the body in every direction
Forcing the joints unnatural flexion

[Solo Pat O'Brien]

Twisting limbs until they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Bent
Bent
Bent
Backwards and broken

// They Deserve To Die //

Violence is legitimate is causes such as this
Cruel retribution is fitting
Vengeance will be dealt out with ruthless iron fist
Worthless filth receive no mercy

They deserve to die
They deserve to die

Plans have been completed
And the time is drawing near
Punishment will be relentless

They deserve to die
They deserve to die

Vacuous faces hammered into mash
Beaten senseless, sense they never had
Merciless smashing shatters teeth and bone
Ignorance earned every crushing blow

Killing has just started and my lust for blood will grow
Justice will be found in murder
Stupid as they are they didn't know the seeds they'd sown
Grew into my savage hatred

They deserve to die
They deserve to die

Skull is fractured by the pounding
Eyes dislodging from their sockets
Brains spill out, the skull is split through
Mind vacant, now cranium too

Guilty thoughts will not infect me
Soulless scum receive no pity

Deceptive tongues hew by my blade
Forked like a snake now on the ground they lay
They had no conscience so there is no loss
For my redemption there must be a cost

They deserve to die
They deserve to die
Die
