// The Undead Will Feast //

Undead feast, as they tear upon your weak flesh
Terror builds, at the thought of being dead
Prophecy of the wisemen of old
Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil
Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead
The dead awake, what the populace is fearing
Panic strikes as the nations run in fear
Oceans boil with blood of human victims

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us

Tables turn as a victim I've become now
State of death only waiting to return
Vital signs that show I'm dead
This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave
Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual
Flesh becomes my only crave of this live
Unthinking state, a state of metamorphosis
Seeking food to keep me dead
Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his terror
Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill
Seeking human victims to meet my fill
Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain

Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain
As its fluids drip down the drain
Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder
The vile stench only makes me madder

In through the mouth, out the forehead
Brains fall out, skin turns red
Violent surge, a spear through the skull
Felt the urge, now my heart's full

I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

I love gore, blood drives me nuts
I drink blood, I don't like water
Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter
Twist its neck, make it crack

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us
Blood I want to drink, I want to suck
Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck
Bones into a spear, I'll carve and kill
Hunger for the quest, I'll never fill

I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

// No Remorse //

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse

// Systematic Elimination //

Scurrilous, wide spread death
Punitive, stagnant mess
Rancorous killing spree
Punishing massacre

Eternal insanity fueling the need
To randomly vanquish mankind
The inception of ultra demise

Systematic elimination
Systematic elimination

Barbarous, genocide
Mutilate, withered lives, ominous

Systematic elimination
Systematic elimination

Die human thing rot eternally
One, one by one are left to bleed
Cries bellowing instant misery
Gone, life is gone lying in death's bed

The act of mudering so empowering
Exact number of dead will be unkown
Intact corpse are few and far between

One, one by one

Killing and killing at will
Methodic destruction must thrive
Values of horror instilled
Deep in a most sinister mind

Rancorous, barbaraous
Scurrilous, ominous
You will now die

Annihilate the populace
To conserate this earth as a grave

One, one by one

Systematic elimination
Systematic elimination
One by one rot eternally

// Worm Infested //

Enter the graveyard,
Searching for a female corpse
Dead for thirteen years
The perfect whore to fill my need

Dig her body up
Crack open gruesome tomb
Ceremonial
Covert necrophilia

Why must I masturbate at the sight of maggots
That are crawling on her face ?
Drawn to the coffin's stench that holds an impure
Wench, inhumanity
Half skeletal remains
Insatiable desire to inseminate
Swarm a parasitic plague enables me to emulate
A state of constant disarray

Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested

Chew the bitches fuckin' head
Eat her fetid skin and relish in the violation
Tear tissue from the bone as these actions go
Unkown; vicious cruelty
Vile distal cruelty
Snapping bones in two, defiling cavities continues
Fierce repulsive fanasies enables me to emulate
A state of constant disarray

Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
I must fuck her worm infested, worm infested
Cunt

Excoriate, disseminate, demoralize, to sodomize
Excoriate, disseminate, demoralize, to sodomize

Despicable degradation, excoriate her
Inimical depredation, disseminate her
Ignominious domination, demoralize her
Presumptuous defecation to sodomize her

Why must I masturbate at the sight of maggots
That are crawling on her face ?
Drawn to the coffin's stench that holds an impure
Wench, inhumanity
Half skeletal remains
Insatiable desire to inseminate
Swarm a parasitic plague enables me to emulate
A state of constant disarray

Dead for thirteen years
The perfect whore to fill my need

Despicable degradation, excoriate her
Inimical depredation, disseminate her
Ignominious domination, demoralize her
Presumptuous defecation to sodomize her

Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
I must fuck her worm infested, worm infested
Cunt

Worm infested cunt

// Demon's Night //

Sparks - the eyes of fire
Flying high in the night
Storms - the arms of evil
It's gonna take your life

You know the bats crying
Hell bent for the death
Rain - the tears of the devil
Gonna lay you to rest

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

You - you've lost your freedom
To the masters of force
Ride on the waves of magic
Dark nights will be your course

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night - a night to die

Lights - blinding your mind
Like a flash out of hell
Sounds - that no one will hear
It's a demon's bell

Look in the face of horror
It's a dangerous night
Scream for your mother's children
You've lost your human right

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night
Demon's night - a night to die

Rolling a thunder - a curse on that night
We've got your number - no use to hide

Demon's night - no way out
Demon's night - the angels fight
Demon's night - cries of pain
Demon's night
A night to die

// Confessions //

Crimes of passion
Ruled his mind
The anger inside
Compassion he will never find

The pain and pleasure
Of the blade
And he loved
The screams she made

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Because the anger
Burned within

Unfaithful
He saw it in her eyes
They wouldn't hide
Betrayal and her wicked lies

Confessions
From a dying man
Listen now
And understand

Shadows
In the night
Pain
That summons fright

He looked
Into her eyes
And tells her
Tonight she dies

But to you
I must confess
That when she died
She was the best
