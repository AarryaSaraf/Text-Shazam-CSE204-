Album: Vile

// Devoured By Vermin //

Ravenous waves attack,
drawn by the scent of life
Fever for our blood

Instinct rules this mass, ruthless living sea
Devouring

Countless vermin gnashing at my face
Tear meat from my skull
Swarming, rabid, features are erased
Unrecognizable
Body covered, rat filled innards
Shred internal organs
Heart and lungs consumed from inside but my
pain doesn't end
I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Resistance now gives way,
the rodents freely feed
Tearing at my skin
Muscles are exposed, shining red with blood
Meat that they seek

Crawling rodents gorging on me
Repulsive starving droves
Shredding, stripping, consuming all I was
Tissue pulled from bones
Dying slowly, feeling every fang
Shock has yet to come
Scavengers tear out my eyes
My pain won't end, I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Ruthless gnawing vermin - feed
Cleaning off my bones while I breathe
Stenching greasy rodents - swarm
My body is losing its form

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

// Mummified In Barbed Wire //

Wrap the wire round the neck,
pull it tight to suffocate
His mouth is spewing steaming blood
Hang the body with a cord, gag his mouth
with shards of steel
He doesn't know the pain he'll feel
Interwoven deadly spikes, tightening cables
lacerate
Assorted gashes open wide
Ruptured veins are gushing blood, scraps of
skin are flying off
The body of the helpless prey

Jagged cable binds, you scream, No escape
Metal barbs tearing at you, Rend your flesh

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Rip the tissue from the body, Rend your flesh

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Tangled in a web of pain, No escape
Blood seeps through the metal sheath,
Saw-like noose

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Gleaming cords encase the corpse, No escape

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Steel wraps your face, blood soaks the steel
Bound in wire, soon to die, life choked out,
bleed to death

// Perverse Suffering //

Lusting for eternal pain
Begging to be tortured
Agony brings relief, I am insane

Indulging in self-mutilation
To satisfy my need again
The pain severe from severed veins
Curing me of deprivation
Pain I crave
Euphoric state of butchery
Revelling in gore and blood
Pain I save
Igniting visions of the past
Dismembered bodies never found
Pain I gave

Deranged by my deviance,
savage goal to maim and kill
Obsessed with my cruelty,
vicious ways for me to die
Sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality
Pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my
lust for pain

Punishment my way of life,
suffering intensifies
Sacrifice
Brutal frenzy, no control,
perverse actions gratify
Wretched abnormality,
condoning inhumanity
Suicide
Carnivorous abusiveness,
boiling sawn-off testicles

Afflicted fate stricken to malignancy
Lechery dominates my misery

Tortured eternally, torment inside of me
Disturbing impulses, living in agony
Rancid degenerate craving impalement
Demented destiny, not fearing agony

Excruciating hunger that I need to feed
Soon to be slaughtered, dead, maliciously

Tortured eternally, torment inside of me
Disturbing impulses, living in agony
Rancid degenerate craving impalement
Demented destiny, not fearing agony

Deranged by my deviance,
savage goal to maim and kill
Obsessed with my cruelty,
vicious ways for me to die
Sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality
Pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my
lust for pain

// Disfigured //

Repulsion of beauty drove me to hunt
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Violated their bodies, stripped of their pride
Tortured and twisted until they have died
Hatred inside is all I would find

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
I kill them but it's myself I hate
Now I'll do myself too
A straight razor will reshape my face
First my ears then my nose
Blood is gushing continue to carve
Erase the face I hate
Now I'm hacking at my chest
A frenzy of self hate possessed me
Controls my actions, controls my thoughts
As I scrape away at my skin

I fill my tub, with alcohol
I plunge into the burning pool
The pain intense, my whole body
Is drenched in scalding liquid
Despite my pain I am able
To grab a lighter on the counter
The flint ignites, the flames erupt
I'm consumed in the inferno
Cauterize, my skin is charred
Regenerate, more loathsome than before

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
The abomination before my eyes
A reflection of me
I see an image of disfigured evil
I've skinned myself alive
Dripping with blood and blistered by fire
The face I hate erased

// Bloodlands //

I am lost and sickened
Disoriented by this bleak environment
How I came to be here escapes my memory
This is a desert, deep scarlet grains
Stretch the horizon and the sickly brown sky
Gale force winds pepper my face
The sand tastes foul,
the sand tastes like blood

Savagely cruel, barren expanse, the atmosphere,
a caustic fog
Every breath reminds me of pain
Dust of dried blood filling my lungs
On the horizon I see a chasm, a distant pulse
begins to beat

[Lead - Owen]

Suddenly a flash, specter of the past
Vision of mass murder, torrents of blood

The vision quickly ends,
the wasteland still beckons
Plodding toward the chasm
I hear rushing liquid

My mind cannot conceive,
the massacre I behold
An infinite river of cadavers,
buoyant in their own blood
Vertigo engulfs my brain as
my body fails and drops

[Lead - Barrett]

A million corpses staring
Straining to survive,
limbs flailing in the blood
Grapple with headless bodies
Hands of the dead are pulling me downward
Drowning in this river
Intestines are alive, like tentacles they choke
Situation hopeless
I submit to the fury of the river

Paralyzed with terror
Thousands of their thoughts
are entering my mind
Conscious on their level
Every tortured death is experienced at once
Drowning in their anguish
Ordeal of their deaths now saturates my brain
Vengeful corpses shrieking
Genocide, genocide, genocide, genocide

// Puncture Wound Massacre //

Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Die, butcher
Rage of hate
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill

Kick down the door in barbaric rage
Frantically slashing all who stand in my way
Stab another face, slit another throat
My intention is to mutilate them
People are screaming it feeds my hate
Hack through the crowd blood is splashing on
my face
I only see red, rage exploding
Two knives, one mind, that hate has broken

Stabbing, disfigure, knives puncture
Blood gushing from their wounds
Rivers run deep red
Down faces of people in the room
Bodies are heaping they're dying
In seconds they were slain
Daggers in my hands are killing
This worthless piece of shit

[Lead - Owen]

Hate for them still drives my rage
My job is almost finished only one remains
In the corner terrified behind the
grisly slaughter
I'll take my time on this last scum bag
Knife in stomach, he's not dead yet
Carving up his body, gouge his fucking head
Chop off his arms, pull out his guts
No remorse for what I have done

Stabbing, disfigure, knives puncture
Blood gushing from their wounds
Rivers run deep red
Down faces of people in the room
Daggers in my hands are killing
This worthless pieces of shit

// Absolute Hatred //

Never leave your nest unguarded
Next of kin the first to go
Absolute hatred cast upon the family
Payback for the hated one

I am the judge, jury, executioner
And pallbearer all in one
Process of elimination
Affirmative action has just begun
Expectorate upon your soul
Malicious devilry is unleashed ten fold
You cannot hide

Witness of my stopping power
Reaction time is not enough
Psychological torment tearing at you sanity
it has to be, it must be done

Hatred flows, uncontained, feel my wrath
Through the death of your entire tribe

Hatred flows, uncontained
I must archieve my revenge through hatred

[Lead - Owen]
[Lead - Barrett]

I've regained my pride
Victory's mine
You cannot hide
The footsteps you hear are gonna be mine

// Eaten From Inside //

[Lead - Owen]

Dwelling inside was an anger, an anger that
grew into hatred
Grinding, churning inside of me
Seeking, finding the need to feed
On my soul, it now appears I've lost control
Of my mind, it's now begun to tear and grind
The pain, its destination my brain
Can't hide from being eaten
from inside - inside

Originating deep within, a heart
that is now cold and dead
Tearing its way through my organs,
leaving nothing but shreds
Ripping, tissue is torn away
Severing, parts and veins in the way
My insides are on the outside of me
My bones now shatter and explode
The pain, its destination my brain
Can't hide from being eaten from inside

[Lead - Owen]

Left on the ground is my head,
waiting for the final blow
Brain violently corroding,
the end won't come fast only slow
Seeing what's left of my body
Drowning, blood is surrounding me
My skull melts revealing my brain
Exploding, my body's imploding
The pain, its destination my brain
I've died, I've been eaten from inside

// Orgasm Through Torture //

Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise

Stalking the night, searching for
A victim to defile
Cock she craves today
Cum she wants to spray
And to reach the orgasm through torture

From behind, pain shivering down my spine
I feel paralyzed only controlling my mind

Strapped to a table, naked, genitals exposed
Eyes claimed open, mouth
gagged shut, terrified
Locks my scrotum in a vice and
tightens forcefully
Agony, silent screams, want to die

Shackled and bound, unaware my fate
Destined to be maimed to stimulate

The skin is peeled off my dick
Done with a razor blade
She begins to suck
Blood and cum amok
She rips my cock off with her teeth
Masticate, gnawing and chewing the stump
She regurgitates, I'm covered in my bloody
chunks

Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise

I am alive, victimized
Tortured fate, asexual state

// Monolith //

Imminent decay of life
Ruthless, dead monolith
Human race will be devoured
Cannibals

Ghoulish - undead vanguard, silent killers,
striking quickly
Blood lust - for the living, eat their flesh,
drink their blood
Callous - in their method,
murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith of undead
Slay the living
Is only object for this
bestial rotting horde
Slaughtering the helpless,
slaughter all that lives
Driven by an evil force, to feed on humankind
Exterminate resistance, exterminate them all
Cunning and yet mindless
stealthfully they kill
Army of decay plodding
toward the breathing ones
Countless decomposing
corpses walk upon the earth
Outnumbering the living,
soon they'll be extinct

Zombies, seek life
Mindless killing all in sight,
addicted to entrails
They crave warm flesh
Hunting, dead seek
Ruthless feeding on the weak,
savagery prevails
Tear them to shreds
Fighting, undead
Flesh wounds bleeding black not red,
invincible undead force
There is no hope
Zombies, devour
Quicken mankind's final hour,
fate will run its course
There is no hope

Walking dead surround,
search for living flesh
Ambush on the town, takes a shocking toll
Screams of living fade as
the dead destroy their lives
They die
Hollowed bodies heap, empty carcasses
Innards are devoured by the mob of ghouls
Remaining living flee the horde

Ghoulish - undead vanguard, silent killers,
striking quickly
Blood lust - for the living,
drink their fresh blood
Callous - in their method
murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith

[Lead - Owen]

Imminent decay of life
Cause by this monolith
Human race was sacrificed
Their future does not exist

Armies of undead
Slaying the living
Bestial rotting horde
Monolith of death
Cannibals
