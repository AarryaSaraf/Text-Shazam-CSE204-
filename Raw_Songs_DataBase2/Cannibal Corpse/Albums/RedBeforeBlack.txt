// Only One Will Die //

A violent conflict between two foes
At close quarters pound and slash
The blood will flow, barbaric melee, a hateful duel
Shared abhorrence gives the conflict

Fuel
Add to the fire
Lies
Resentment built
For years
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

The cracking bones and shattered teeth
Wounds are swelling, lacerations running deep
Losing blood but still we fight
Both resolved to end the other's life

The only answer
Hate
Can only end with death
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

Both of us are killers, both are evil men
Unforgiving murderers today may kill again

Both of us will throttle strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness, revenge has us enslaved
Both are badly wounded and struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death but only one will die

Die

Both of us will bludgeon, both of us will pound
Facial bones will splinter soon, the blood will drench the ground
Both are rending flesh, both are gouging eyes
Escalating violence, the brawl intestifies

Both of us will throttle strangling with rage
Both consumed by madness, revenge has us enslaved
Both are badly wounded and struggle to survive
Both are fighting to the death but only one will die

Die

Kill
The only answer
Hate
Can only end with death
Now
It's time to end this fight
Until the death
Striking to kill
Only one
Only one will die

// Red Before Black //

Knives brought the blood
That's on the ground
Blood will paint the sky
Into darkness

Overtorture lacerated sacrificial decimation
Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack

Cut for the blood
Dried on the ground
Blood painted the sky
Through the darkness

Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Overkilling eradicated monumental crimson staining
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack

Bleed before death bleed during death bleed after death
Perpetual bloodshed onslaught through hatred

Overtorture lacerated sacrificial decimation
Overviolent mutilation brutally eviscerated
Dead beyond dead

Red before black
Made to suffer through the torture
Red then black into the unknown
With no coming back
Red before black
Disemboweling frantically
Pure ecstasy pure misery
Blood flows from the attack

// Shedding My Human Skin //

Up from the depths of creation
To dwell among a world for the weak
Confined to this creature of foreign flesh substance
Reformed from within
A savage conclusion impending
Demonic invasion of a dominant hierarchy

Alternate paths of temptation
In tongues an evil purity will speak
Symbolic redemption through an imminent transformation

Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn

Slow slicing
Mutating through the blood
Self carving
Erupting from within

Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Shedding my human skin
Skin
My human skin

Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn

Savage conclusion impending
In tongues an evil purity will speak
Demonic invasion of a dominant hierarchy

// Remaimed //

All that remains
Are those that were remaimed

Crush the village and plunder
Like many times before
Rape the women and slaughter all the children
Everyone is mangled and deformed
They all have lost a limb or two
With another one to follow
Decaying torn off penises
Which the men were made to chew and swallow

Subjected to these atrocities
Like many times before
The women bore bastard children
Who were mangled and deformed
Born without a limb or two
Like it fucking matters
At most they'll live for several years
Until the next raid occurs

The first time they came
All were horribly maimed
And every time after
Remaimed through sick laughter
Remaimed
Remaimed until they die
Die from being maimed again
Remaimed
Remaimed

The first time they came
All were horribly maimed
And every time after
Remaimed through sick laughter
Remaimed
Remaimed until they die
Die from being maimed again
Remaimed
Remaimed

// Firestorm Vengeance //

Venomous blood courses through our veins
Poisoned by indignation
So much blood on their callous hands
Cruelty their ruination

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance

They sought to oppress under duress
Never thinking of this day
No cheeks were turned, now the bodies burn
And the tyrants writhe in pain
No mercy for the merciless
The time for that has passed
Flagellate before they burn
They scream with every lash

Ravaging their halls of torture and death
Craving retribution
Winds of hatred fan the flames
Reprisal's conflagration

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance

Searing heat chars their flesh
Burning judgment
Punish them

Furious inferno
They cry in pain
No mercy

Firestorm
Payback for their crimes

No escape from this hell
They will burn here
Flames consume

Bodies burnt to the bone
Reduced to coals
The oppressors pay

Firestorm
Persecution ends
Firestorm
Despot burn in hell

Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance
Firestorm vengeance

// Heads Shoveled Off //

Back in 'Nam he killed a man
A shovel was used to cut his head off
Now forever changed lust to decapitate
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact

Going insane
Come back deranged

He buries his victims
Only the heads exposed
The screams don't bother him
But he likes to make them stop

Eyes wide open
As they see the shovel
Coming at them slowly
Blood spurts through the air
Head detaches from the body
The eyes can still see
But the brain starts to die rapidly

Back in 'Nam he killed a man
Many more would die
Shovels used to cut their heads off
Now forever changed lust to decapitate
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact

Going insane
Come back deranged

The open neck holes fester
Ravaged by the vultures
Bodies for the insects
And the skulls are for the collection
Brains and eyes are eaten
Gnaw the skin though rotten
Only bones will remain
But the skulls are for the collection

Killings confirmed by the hundreds
Were carried out after the war in due time
Killings confirmed by the thousands
Were carried out after the war with his mind

Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off
Heads shoveled off

// Corpus Delicti //

Enter the scene, horrific violence
Deceptive pretense
Feeble attempt to mislead with false evidence
Corpus delicti

Luminol reveals the truth
Blood spatter throughout the entire room
Virtue is choked out by foul ambition
Welcome to the killing room

Capricious malevolence
No body, no homicide
Imaginary intruder
Contributing blood continuously
Bleach the stains
Forward to entropy

// Scavenger Consuming Death //

Hammers swing, cracking their skulls
Blades slash, spraying their blood
He waits, watching them kill
When they're done, he will feed

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Viscera, torsos torn
Chopping off legs and arms
Sounds of violence draw him near
Soon he'll feed, soon he'll feed

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Scavenger consuming death
Body parts and severed heads
Scavenger consuming death
Human vulture seeks your end

Scavenger
Gruesome forager
Tracking murderers
What they leave behind will feed this ghoulish fiend

Cannibal
Waits for you to fall
Insatiable
Your mangled corpse will soon become his latest meal

They have died
Eat their flesh
Before they rot

Gnaw and tear
The fresh meat
Leave only bones

A morbid harvest, once alive
Murdered, butchered, eaten, they're gone
Exploit the carnage, he survives
Hunting, waiting, reaping, death's spawn
Eat them all

Scavenger consuming death
Yield of violence gives him life
Scavenger consuming death
Parasite awaits your demise

Scavenger consuming death
Body parts and severed heads
Scavenger consuming death
Human vulture seeks your end

// In The Midst Of Ruin //

The present has become the past
Mayhem and chaos foreboding

Brought back to the dark ages
Modern technology wiped from the earth
A world darkened once again
In the midst of ruin we will be
Anarchy

Malicious indifference ruling the land
You'd better be ready to die
It's kill or be killed
Barely surviving through primitive warfare
Only the strongest will thrive
I will not be killed

Every man for himself
Most of them turn to suicide
The populace forced to revert
Lacking in normalcy
Anarchy

In the midst of ruin
In the midst of ruin
In the midst of ruin
Most life will cease to exist

Malicious indifference ruling the land
You'd better be ready to die
It's kill or be killed
Barely surviving through primitive warfare
Only the strongest will thrive
I will not be killed

The present has become the past
Mayhem and chaos foreboding

Brought back to the dark ages
Modern technology wiped from the earth
A world darkened once again
In the midst of ruin we will be
Anarchy

// Destroyed Without A Trace //

Festering morbid decay
Saturates the air again
Stenches of a different pleasure
Boiling blood hole deepens
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Slaughtered day by day
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Vanished when unfit for life
Betrayal not uncommon
Severed for the sacrifice
Appease the inner demon
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Boiling blood hole deepens
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Given away
Life is taken away

Coordinate the mutilations
Simplify the deviance
Rectify the situation
Bodies chopped with diligence
Discarded humans melting fast
Enveloped in putrid vapor
Slaughtered day by day
Destroyed without a trace

Given away
Life is taken away
Morbid decay
In vain they have suffered and died

Gathered for the execution, brutal murders one by one begin
They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die
Dissected for incineration, chosen for annihilation
They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die

Never to be seen or heard
Now just a memory gone for all eternity
Cast into non-existence

Given away
Life is taken away

Festering morbid decay
Saturates the air again
Stenches of a different pleasure
Boiling blood hole deepens
Filled with remains, once pitiful lives
Slaughtered day by day
Die without a face
Destroyed without a trace

Gathered for the execution
Brutal murders one by one begin
Dissected for incineration
Chosen for annihilation

Never to be seen or heard
Now just a memory gone for all eternity
Burnt into non-existence

Given away
Life is taken away
Morbid decay
In vain they have suffered and died

// Hideous Ichor //

Decay, distinct and putrid
Moldering remnants compel
Fetor, the stench entices me

Singular insanity guiding me, driving me
Consume the putrefied rot
Bodies of the dead nourish me

Madness, obsessive hunger
Sickening urges demand
Offal, I crave voraciously

Cadaver in the cemetery beckoning, summoning
Ghastly fumes diffuse retch
Fluids of the dead slowly flow

Steeping in the wooden box gurgling, churning
Deadly viscous ooze flux
Flowing from within, I must drink

Hideous ichor drips from the coffin
Inside the corpse has stirred
Horrors within my sustenance
But is it truly dead
Hideous ichor exudes from the crypt
Necrotic but somehow alive
The eyes of the dead blankly stare
But did it truly die

Siphoning of the blood
Plunging my hands in rot
Macabre desire, death
Macabre desire, death
Feeding this ghoulish urge
Unwholesome at its core
Macabre desire, death
Macabre desire, death

The corpse must somehow live
To give me strength this way
Macabre desire, death
Macabre desire, death
Was I hunting it
Or was it luring me
Macabre desire, death
Macabre desire, death

Hideous ichor drips from the coffin
Inside the corpse has stirred
Horrors within my sustenance
But is it truly dead
Hideous ichor exudes from the crypt
Necrotic but somehow alive
The eyes of the dead blankly stare
But did it truly die
