// Heartbreaker //

She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
Oh, real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
When she holds my hand I get warm inside
Something happened that I can't describe
She never talk serious 'bout love or romance
She's the kinda babe that won't give your heart a chance

A real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

No one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
When she goes out, man, she has a ball
She don't date one, she'd love to date them all

She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's real heartbreaker, don't you know?
A real heartbreaker, mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

Well, no one man ever enters her mind
She loves to flirt with maybe eight or nine
She made up her mind, man, to really live
She gonna go out and live for real

She's a mean manhater, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?
She's a real heartbreaker, a mean man hater
She's a real heartbreaker, don't you know?

A real heartbreaker, a real heartbreaker
A mean man hater, a real heartbreaker

// Losing Faith In You //

There was a time when I believed in you
Oh, and nothing wrong that you could ever do.
But you've changed, and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

I was so in love, till I was blind.
No, I could never believe that cheatin' was on your mind.
Oh, you've changed, and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

Oh, I gave you my heart, gave you all my love.
And I asked for nothing, nothing in return.
I was so happy with you, baby, thinkin' you were mine.
Oh, but how much, how much I paid to learn.

Oh, how I suffered since finding out you, baby,
You were all you cared about.
Oh, you've changed and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

Oh, you've changed. Yes, you really changed.
And I'm losing the faith that I had,
Losing the faith that I had,
Losing the faith that I had in you.

// Dance With Me //

I want to dance with you baby
But I don't move around so fast
I want to dance with you baby
But I don't move around so fast
You really movin me baby
And you know that I can't last

Dance in the morning baby dance till the afternoon
Ooh, Dance in the morning baby dance till the afternoon
Well, I feel so good but I know I got to stop real soon

Wake me shake me 
Keep me on my feet
And out of this world
Every time we meet

I'm dancing with you baby, doing the best I can
I gotta keep on dancing baby and then we'll make romance

I gotta rock with you baby 
Till my feet wont move on the floor
I gotta rock with you baby
Till my feet wont move on the floor
I gotta rock as long as I can baby 
And then I'll have to rock some more

So, wake me shake me 
Keep me on my feet
And out of this world
Every time we meet

I gotta keep on rocking
Rock as long as I can
I gotta keep on rocking
As long as I be your man

// That's Wrong, Little Mama //

When you fight with your lover
She takes you for a fool
She don't care how she hurts you
Long as she's doing what she choose
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That ain't the way to do

When you work each day
Stay at home every night
She'd find a fault with everything
Ain't nothin' ever right

That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That ain't the way to do

And she's out on the weekend
She'd come back holdin' her head
You ask her for some lovin'
She'll say she's half-dead

That's wrong, little mama
That's wrong, little mama
That's wrong, little mama
That ain't the way to do

Oh, it's wrong little mama
Yes, it's wrong little mama
I say, it's wrong little mama
You know it's wrong little mama
Yeah, it's wrong little mamma

// I'm Not Wanted Anymore //

Sometimes
I got worried wo, ho
I don't know what to do
Because the women that I'm loving
Is breaking my heart in two

I remember way back
When all the money
The money was rolling in
My women was good to me
And I had a lot of friends

Oh, but now I'm getting older
Whoa and the money
The money it's coming in slow
And now that women she put me
I'm not wanted anymore

Yeah, my women, my women
Doesn't want me
I'm not wanted, not wanted anymore

// Worried Dream //

Well, I feel so bad, I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad, I wonder what's wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter
Can be

Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face
Now, when I woke up, early this morning
The tears were runnin' all down my face
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin'
My place

I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin' you this evening
Baby, tell me, 'cause I've just got to know

I've been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true

// Paying The Cost To Be The Boss //

You act like you don't want to listen
When I'm talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you wanna do
You must be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I'll drink if I want to
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm taking care of you
As long as I'm workin baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live
You must be crazy woman
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I foot the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You don't act like my woman
You just usin' my name
I tell you I'm gonna have all the money
And I don't want no back-talk
Cause if you don't like the way I'm doin'
Just pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
You must be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

// Until I Found You //

All of my life, I've been searchin'
For someone that's lonely too
I know my darlin', I found you

I'm gonna make you happy
Oh, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do all I can for you

Whenever I'm near you, oh, I can't control my self
My heart, it beats so fast until I know

I know this love is gonna last

Now, now my searchin', my searchin' is over
Oh, and I touch myself, I touch myself everyday
Because I never thought that anyone
Could make me feel this way

You know I never thought, I never thought
I never thought that anyone
Anyone could make me feel this way

// I'm Gonna Do What They Do To Me //

The next woman I get
She gotta have job
I'm not tryin' to be no pimp
I just don't intend to work to hard
I won't have to buy the groceries
She gotta pay the rent
She gotta fill up my car every day
And give me account of every dime she spend

I made up my mind
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

She gotta make me think she loves me
By staying in her place
And sleep in another room
So she won't be snorin' in my face
And when I ask her for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you have no frown

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
Yes I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

Now when I ask for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you be no clown
Now that might sound cold to ya baby
You might think I'm unfair
But I've been hurt so many times
Till I, I really don't care

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

// Raining In My Heart //

Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home
You got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again

Honey, I need your love
Darlin', you know why
If you would come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry

Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home
