// You're Still My Woman //

When I come home in the morning
And I knock on the door
I don't get that glad-to-see-you welcome
The glad-to-see-you welcome any more
Oh but to me
It's just like it used to be, baby
Because you are still my woman

You know a change have come
And I guess I'll blame it on fate
The thing that once was love
It now seems to turn to hate
Oh I guess it's too late
For me now, baby
But you are still my woman

You know I tried to be
The man you wanted me to be
But whatever I do, baby
It seems to add to your misery
Oh you can do
What you want to, baby
But you are still my woman

You know I'm still hoping and praying
That someday I'll find
Someone to love me
So I can have love and peace of mind
Oh I still love you
Like I did before, baby
Because you are still my woman

Your  friends are all telling you
That I'm a no good so-and-so
They say that love and affection
Have now turned to a heart
A heart that's old and cold
It's the same old story
Same old story that's so often told

You are still my woman

// Ask Me No Questions //

You go out when you get ready
And you come home when you please
You just love me when you want me baby
And you think it outta be all right with me

When I try to talk to you baby
And let you know just how I feel
You tell me if I don't like it
You know someone else will

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby
And I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like to feel arms around me
And lips close, close to mine
So I don't have to beg you to love me
I don't have to beg you all the time

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
So now don't ask me no questions baby
And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies

Yes you can love me if you want me
Or you keep on flaying the field
Because I know if you don't love me
I know there's somebody else that will

// Until I'm Dead And Cold //

Oh by loving you
Loving you, my darling
Oh you've become
Much more than a lover to me
Yes, you are my companion
Oh you're my friend
And baby, you know
You're a part of me

Oh and that's why
Why I'm so lonely
Oh I'm so lonely
These passing days
Because I miss you, my darling
Not just one
But in so many, so many ways

Oh there's nothing left
Nothing left inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
Oh and if you
Wanna know the truth, baby
If you really, really
Wanna know the truth, baby
You know I want you
And need you even more

Oh what's done is done, baby
So I've been told
Oh but I can't stop loving you
Seems like I love you more
And I'll keep on loving you, baby
Until, until I'm dead and cold

Oh there's nothing left
Inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
M, and if you really
If you really, if you really
Wanna know the truth, baby
I love you, I love you
I love you even more

What is done, what is done
What is done is done
Oh but you know
I just can't stop loving you
I  tell you the truth
I love you more, baby
And I'll keep on loving you
Until I'm dead
Until I'm dead and cold

// Ain't Gonna Worry My Life Anymore //

Don't care when you go
How long you stay
Good time treatments
Bring you back someday
Oh but someday, baby
I  ain't gonna worry my life any more

Ain't but one thing
Give me the blues
When I've worn a hole
In my last pair of shoes
Oh but someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

// Chains And Things //

Woke up this morning
After another one of those crazy dreams
Oh, nothing is going right this morning
The whole world is wrong it seems
Oh, I guess it's the chains that bind me
I can't shake it loose, these chains and things

Got to work this morning
Seems like everything is lost
I got a cold hearted wrong doin' woman
And a slave driving boss
I can't loose these chains that bind me
Can't shake them loose, these chains and things
Just can't loose these chains and things

Oh, you talk about hard luck and trouble
Seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
Yes, I can only play a losin' game
These chains that bind me
Can't lose these chains and things
Just can't loose  these chains and things

Oh, I would pack up and leave today people
But I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got money to buy a ticket
And I don't feel like walkin' anymore
These chains that bind me
Oh, I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and things

// Go Underground //

Yes, you thought
You had a good thing, baby
You could do what you wanted to do
Yes, but you'd better
Find you another thing, baby
Because this thing
Is cutting out on you
I'm tired of you putting me down
I think I'll do like a mole
And move underground

I tried to do
Everything for you, baby
Tried to give you everything
Even the stars above
Oh but you wanted someone
To play with, baby
And I needed me someone to love
I say I'm tired of you
Putting me down
I think I'll do like a mole
And move underground

Yes, I can't be a winner, baby
Because I was born to lose
I go to bed every night
With troubles, baby
Because I wake up
Thinking about you
I'm tired of you
Putting me down, baby
I think I'm gonna do like a mole
And move underground

Oh I paid the cost, baby
I even sing the blues
I've done everything to please you
And I'm tired of paying my dues
And I'm tired of you
Putting me down
That's why I'm gonna do like a mole
And move underground

// Hummingbird //

Sometimes I get impatient 
but she cools me without words 
and she comes so sweet and so plain 
my hummingbird and have you heard 
that I thought my life had ended 
but I find that it's just begun 
cause she gets me where I live 
I'll give all I have to give 
I'm talking about that hummingbird 
oh she's little and she loves me 
too much for words to say 
when I see her in the morning sleeping 
she's little and she loves me 
to my lucky day 
hummingbird don't fly away 

When I'm feeling wild and lonesome 
she knows the words to say 
and she gives me a little understanding 
in her special way 
and I just have to say 
in my life I loved a woman 
because she's more than I deserve 
and she gets me where I live 
I'll give all I have to give 
I'm talking about that hummingbird 
oh she's little and she loves me 
too much for words to say 
when I see her in the morning sleeping 
she's little and she loves me 
to my lucky day 
hummingbird don't fly away
