// Blind Love //

People, I was standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Yes, standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Well, I could see the woman I'm loving
Stopping everyone in the world she meets

Well, standing on the corner
Between 35th and Main
Well, standing on the corner, people
Between 35th and Main
Yeah, that's where a blind man's seen my woman
People, a dumb man called her name

He said, "Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
"Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
Yes, and the dumb man asked a question
"Woman, who may your good man be?"

Yes, I'm standing by trembling, people
People, my heart's laying in my hand
I'm standing by trembling, darling
With my heart's laying in my hand
Well, I could hear my baby say
"Lord, I ain't got no man"

// Waitin' On You //

Yes, it's four o'clock
In the morning, baby
I'm sitting here waiting on you
Yes, it's four o'clock
In the morning, baby
I'm sitting here waiting on you
Yeah, you say you're going out dancing
But the dance hall closes at two

Yes, I know it's the weekend, mama
And everybody's having fun
Yes, the weekend, baby
And everybody's having fun
But when it's time for loving, baby
Remember that I'm the only one

Yes, I'm sitting here waiting, baby
Wondering what you're doing out there
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering, baby
Wondering what you're doing out there
I can see you're with another man
Having fun without a care

Yeah, it's four o'clock in the morning
Baby, tell me, where have you been
Yes, it's four o'clock in the morning
Woman, tell me, where have you been
Yeah, you come on in here, woman
And don't let it happen again

// Gamblers' Blues //

I don't know what love is
But I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know I don't know what love is people
Woah, but I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know some people say love is just a gamble
But whatever it is, it's enough to drive old B. mad
They say love is just a proposition people
It's strictly a game of give and take
Yeah, they tell me love, love, love is a proposition people
They say it's strictly a game of give and take
Woah, but my woman took all I gave her
And I'm here to tell to you that love proposition stuff's a fake

Oh, I don't claim to be no gambler people
Oh, I don't know much about the dice
Yes, I don't claim to be no gambler people
I tell you I don't know much about the dice
Oh, but I wait and my baby knows
She knows I'm not the kind that's gonna crap out twice

Yes, she left me early this mornin'
I don't know the reason why
She just got up early this mornin'
Didn't even say goodbye

But I love you, I love you, you know I love you, baby
Although you made me cry
Yes, there are a lot of women who want me
Oh, but how you satisfy?

// Tired Of Your Jive //

You're sittin' there lookin' proud, thinkin' you're so fine
Tryin' to run around with every friend of mine
Think you're so smart baby, think that I'm a fool
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you baby you'd better play it cool
I'm tired of your jive. yeah, baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama, hey, I'm tired of your jive

You think that I don't see what you do behind my back
You think I outta love you baby, no matter how you act
You'll never miss your water baby, till the world goes dry

I'm gonna tell you, gonna miss me, bye bye
I'm tired of your jive, yeah baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama, hey I'm tired of your jive

Sittin' there smilin', like nothing's wrong
I don't intend to pull your coat baby, you'll know it when I'm gone
You'll never miss your water baby, till the world run dry
Now I'm gonna tell you, gonna miss me, bye bye
I'm tired of your jive, baby I'm tired of your jive
Yes, I'm here to tell you woman, baby I'm tired of your jive

// Night Life //

When that ev'nin' sun goes down,
Yeah, you'll find me hangin' around
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life

Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues,
Listen to what they're sayin'
Oh, please listen to the blues,
Listen to the blues they're playin'

Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me,
They're all dreamin' about their old used to be
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life

They tell me life's an empty scene,
An avenue of broken dreams
Because the night life,
It ain't no good life but it's my life

// I Know What You're Puttin' Down //

There's a whole lot of talk around town 
About the way you're carrying yourself 
Whole lot of talk around town, woman 
About the way you're carrying yourself 
You're jiving everybody in town 
But old B., that's me 
I know what you've been putting down 
You got a rambling mind 
Just don't wanna stay at home 
You got a rambling mind, woman 
You just don't wanna stay at home 
You ain't got no job in town 
And I know what you've been putting down 
Everybody wants you, baby 
Everybody but me 
I said every 
Everybody wants you, woman 
Everybody but me 
You've been jiving everybody in town, baby 

But I know what you've been putting down 
You went out late last night 
To a dinner show and a dance 
You went out late last night, baby 
A dinner show and a dance 
You must've been a perfect clown 
'Cause I know what you've been putting down 
Yeah, you came home 
Early this morning, woman 
With a new hat, a new dress 
And a new pair of shoes 
Came home early this morning, woman 
With a new hat, a new dress 
And a new pair of shoes 
You ain't been visiting 
Your relatives in town 
I know what you've been putting down

// Baby Get Lost //

Good mornin' baby, baby, welcome back to town
Yeah, you doin' so much trav'lin' woman, I never know when you're gonna be around

Yeah, you a fine and mellow baby but you stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel baby but you treat me like a fool
Two faced woman don't you hand me no double cross
Well, because anytime I'm ready woman
Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"

You cheatin' on the outside, you're doin' ev'rything you chose
