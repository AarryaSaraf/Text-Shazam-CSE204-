// I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water //

Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Right now, I'm realin' and rockin'
I'm spinnin' just like a queen
You'd better have me right now
I don't know how I'll feel
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
You right now, right now, darlin'
I can change my mind
Six month, six month same old sentence
Twelve month won't be long time
To get what you want to me
Have to do I to 99
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, right now, baby
Don't you know Brownie can change my mind
Right now, my card's on the table
I maybe playin' a loosin' hand
But I'd rather drink muddy water
T' see you with another man
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, darlin', here's the time
Right now, right now
Baby, I can change my mind
Right now, right now, my cup runs over
Well, the whole lotta love for you
Right now, if I was in your shoes
I'd do anything you want me to
Right now, right now, now, baby
Right now, right now's the time
Right now, you'd better have me
Cause I can change my mind
Right now, let's go out together, right now

// See See Rider //

See, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
You made me love you, now your man have come
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Lord, Lord, Lord, buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Gonna shoot my baby and catch that cannonball

I'm goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
Lord, Lord, Lord, goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
If I find me a good gal, won't be back at all

Yes, see, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
Well, you made me love you, now your man have come

// Do You Call That A Buddy? //

It was early one Monday mornin'
And I was on my way to school
It was early one Monday mornin'
When I was on my way to school
That was the mornin'
When I broke my mother's rule
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane

Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Please tell me, pretty mama
Who can your great new lover be?

// Wee Baby Blues //

It was early one Monday mornin'
And I was on my way to school
It was early one Monday mornin'
When I was on my way to school
That was the mornin'
When I broke my mother's rule
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
I've been in love with you, baby
Before I learned to call your name
Now you're in love with someone else
I know that's gonna drive me insane

Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Oh, baby, you sure look good to me
Please tell me, pretty mama
Who can your great new lover be?

// How Long, How Long Blues //

How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, how long, baby how long
Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long, how long, how long
If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me
I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me

// Cherry Red //

Run here, pretty mama
Sit down on your daddy's knee
So I can tell everybody
How you've been sending me

Mama, if this is your secret
You better keep it to yourself
Because if you tell me
I might, I might tell somebody else

I like it red, big fat mama
With the meat shakin' on her bone
And every time she walks down the street
Some steely the woman and longs to home
And longs to home

I want you to take me, pretty mama
[Incomprehensible]
I want you to love me, mama
Till my face turns like cherry red

// Please Send Me Someone To Love //

When the evening, the evening sun goes down
You gonna find me somewhere hanging around
The night life, people, it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah

All the people just like you and me
Everybody's dreaming
Dreaming about their old used to be
The night life, hey, it ain't no good life, people
Oh but it's my life

Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to what they're saying
Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to the way they're playing

Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, someone to love

Show the world, show them how to get along
Peace will enter when hate is gone
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

Nights I lay awake and ponder world's troubles
And my answer is always the same
Unless man put an end to this damnable sin
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame

Just because I'm, because I'm in misery
Oh I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, yeah

Oh the night life, people it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah
So please, please, please, please, please, please
Please send me someone to love
Someone to love
