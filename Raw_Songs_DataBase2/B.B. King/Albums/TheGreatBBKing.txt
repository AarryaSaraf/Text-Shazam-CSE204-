// Sneaking Around //

Well hello pretty baby
I just called to say that we're through
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

I want to meet you in the sunlight
Not in a secret rendezvous
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

Oh you never, you're never meant to be mine
I was just too blind to see
Oh but I've got my pride, so why should we hide
When you might as well be free

Oh I love, you know I love you
Oh, and I want to tell the world I do
That's why I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh, I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

// What Can I Do (Just Sing The Blues) //

People say you love but one at time
For every woman there's a man
My baby say she wasn't put here forever
So she's gonna get as many as she can
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, some people may be wrong sometimes
But they can't be wrong all the time
Like they say a cat has nine lives
Nine loves has the woman of mine
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, the women are funny these days
They do wrong in so many ways
They'll have a man twiddling his fingers
Or either drinking his life away
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

// Ten Long Years (I Had A Woman) //

Well I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh she used to love me
And bring my breakfast to my bed every day

For ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Oh for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
And I used to call her my little girl
Oh she used to call me
She used to call me her little boy

Oh it's all over baby
You know I'm all alone
It's all over baby
Damn you know I'm all alone
Well the reason you hear me singing the blues baby
Yeah you know my baby's gone
She's gone she's gone

// (I'm Gonna) Quit My Baby //

Well, I work hard everyday
Come home straight with my pay
My baby either drink it up
Or she threw it all away

I'm gonna quit my baby
If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'
Well, I would rather be alone
Than to be worried out of my mind

Well, I give her all of my money
I think I'm being kind
She buy a quart of bad whiskey

And the rest is beer and wine

Well, a few nights ago
I had to work kinda late
Somebody broke out of my house
Just like he was Superman's mate

Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block
The little moonshine joint and the rest just begin to rock
I sneaked inside to get a better view
I caught my baby doin' the mambo too

// Be Careful With A Fool //

Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, he'll treat you so cold and chilly
It will hurt you to your heart

I hate to remember 
How foolish I used to be
I hate to remember 
How foolish I used to be
Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby
And how bad you treated me

I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
Yes, if you love me a little bit, baby
Why don't you treat me half way right?

It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
I've got you off of my mind, woman
And I've started over again

// Sweet Sixteen - Part 1 //

When I first met you, baby 
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen 
When I first met you, baby 
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen 
You just left your home then, woman 
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen 

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby 
You wouldn't do anything I asked to 
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby 
You wouldn't do anything I asked to 
You know you ran away from your home, baby 
And now you wanna run away from old B. too 

You know I loved you, baby 
I loved you before I could call your name 
You know I loved you, baby 
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name 
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby 
Everything I do is in vain 

My brother's in Korea, baby 
My sister's down in New Orleans 
Brother's in Korea baby 
My sister's down in New Orleans 
You know I'm having so much trouble woman 
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me

Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same

// I Was Blind //

I was blind and I could not see
That you were gettin' away from me
But now I know that you are gone

I live by the night
And slumber through the day
Because life don't seem worth livin' anyway

If I could only see 
Life would be so miserable to me
Tell me why my love want leave me in misery

Oh, now I haven't be true
But this one I want to be my wife
So baby please, please think of you and me

If I could only see 
Life would be so miserable to me
Why would the one I love want to leave me in misery

Oh, haven't been true all of my life
Ah, but this one I want, want her to be my wife
So baby please, baby please think of you and me

// Whole Lot Of Lovin' //

I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
And the way I could love you woman
Honey I know you could love me too

Oh you're so good lookin' baby
And you build up from the ground
Well you're so good lookin' baby

And you build up from the ground
Every time I see you baby
My love starts tumbling down

Yeah, you're just my type baby
Just my height and size
Said you're just my type baby
You're just my height and size
And the reason I love you
Because you've got those little dreamy eyes
