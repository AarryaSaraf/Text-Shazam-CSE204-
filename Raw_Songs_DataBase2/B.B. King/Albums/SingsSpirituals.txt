// Precious Lord //

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, help me stand
Lord, I'm tired, Lord, I'm so weak
Lord, You know I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

When my way, it gets kind of dreary
Precious Lord, somewhere near
When my light is almost gone

Hear my cry, Lord, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

// Save A Seat For Me //

I have a few more
Tears to shed 
I have a few more
Burdens to bear
I have a few more 
Times to give up the right
For the wrong
But I'm gonna keep on 
Pressing on the word
Till my battle if fought
My victory is won
But if u make it in Glory
Be for I do
Save a seat for me

Tell my mother to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I'm on my way home
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I just want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)

Sometimes I've been up
Sometimes I've been down
Sometimes I've been leveled 
I've been leveled down to the ground 
But if you make it in glory
Be for I do 
Save a seat for me

// I'm Working On The Building //

I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation 
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

I'll have a good time
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you see me praying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you hear me singing
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

When you hear me crying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward

I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation 
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
