// Ten Long Years //

Well, I had a woman
She was nice, kind and loving to me in every way
Oh, I had a woman
She was kind and loving to me in every way
Oh, she used to love me
And bring my breakfast to the bed every day

Oh, for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Oh, for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
I used to call her my little girl
Oh, she used to call me, she used to call me her little boy

Oh, it's all over, baby
You know I'm all alone
It's all over, baby
Babe, you know I'm all alone
Well, the reason you hear me singing the blues, baby
Yeah, you know my baby's gone, she's gone, she's gone

// When My Heart Beats Like A Hammer //

When my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Oh, when my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
You know you've only been gone 24 hours, baby
Oh, but it seems like, it seems like a million years

Now if I ever mistreated you baby
You know I didn't mean no harm
Oh, if I ever mistreated you baby
God knows I didn't mean no harm
You know, I'm just a little country boy, baby
And I was raised right down on the cotton farm

Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Babe, that I don't know what to do
Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Baby, I don't know, I don't know what to do
Oh, I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing now, baby
Babe, and it's all on, it's all on account of you

// Days Of Old //

Way back yonder in the days of old
The men were working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She said to herself, "Now that's my fool."

I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool

Met a girl on the avenue
She was shy and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in school
Looked at me and said, "You're my fool."

I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool

Way back yonder in the days of old
The men were working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She said to herself, "Now that's my fool."

I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool

We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Well I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool
