// Sweet Thing //

When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
When I first met you baby
Honey you were almost out of school
You were real wild then woman
Honey, but you were nobody's fool

I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I was so in love with you baby
And I tried to get you to love me too
I thought you had no time for me then woman
Wouldn't do anything I asked to

Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
Oh, sweet thing
You are all I want to see
I having so much trouble baby
I wonder what's gonna happen to me

// I've Got Papers On You, Baby //

I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I mean business woman
I've got too old to play

I've got papers on you baby
And I mean you're mine all mine
I've got papers on you baby
And I mean you're mine all mine
Well, if you do what I tell you woman
We've got to get along real fine

Yes, the red light means stop
The green light means go
Tell you something once
I ain't gonna tell you no more
I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I've got old baby
And I'm too old to play

Well, now I'll see that you eat
Ans see that you have a place to stay
Well, now I'll see that you eat
Ans see that you have a place to stay
Yes, but as long as you stay in this house
I ain't gonna let you have your way

I've got papers on you baby
I mean it in black and white
I've got papers on you baby
I mean it in black and white
Well you're hard to get along with
But you just gotta treat me right

// Tomorrow Is Another Day //

I was trying to be true to you baby
Trying to please you in every way
Yes, but the more I try to please you baby
The further you stray away
Yes, but I know you're gonna miss me baby
Cause tomorrow is another day

Yes, it was just last night baby
When you walked out my door
Yes, you said you didn't want me baby
Said you didn't love me no more
Yes, I'm beggin' you please don't leave me baby
Cause tomorrow is another day

Yes, they say life is a gamble
And you never know what tomorrow may bring
Yes, they say life is a gamble
And you never know what tomorrow may bring
Well I took all of my chances on you baby
Yes, you know I lost everything

// Come By Here //

Come by here, baby, come by here
Come by here, baby, come by here
Come by here, baby, come by here
Oh baby, won't you come by here

I love you baby, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here

Come by here good-looking, come by here
I need you, come by here
Come by here good-looking, come by here
Oh baby, won't you come by here

// The Fool //

Gone are the days I'm holding you tight
Gone are the times I thrill with delight
Oh how I've missed you and your tender kiss
I've been a fool too long

I took your love then broke your heart
Can you forgive me, we'll make a new start
Guess life ain't worth living if you are not giving
I've been a fool to long

I've played the field but could not conceal
The way I feel about you
Everyone guessed I had no happiness
Loving you the way I do

You carried my heart around in your hand
Yes I still love you, please understand
Life ain't worth living if you are not giving
I've been a fool to long

// I Love You So //

Oh my darling I was so lonely
Searching for you and for you only
Oh my darling I love you so

Oh my darling my love is true
Longing for you, no one else will do
Oh my darling I love you so

When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone
I said to myself that I'd make you my own
Your brother caught us kissing
I though he would surely tell
Until he started playing those wedding bells

Now my darling I'm yours forever
Don't ever leave me, leave me never
Oh my darling I love you so

Oh yes it's true, now I have you
And best of all I know now
That I'll never have to be blue
Oh baby, I love you so

I mean you, baby

// Woman I Love //

Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, and the love of my baby, whoo, make me feel this way

Well, she got great big legs, whoo, and the cutest little feet
Yeah, she got great big legs, man, and the cutest little feet
Hey, she upsets ev'rybody, ev'ry man she meet
Alright!

Look out, well, help me, somebody
I love ya baby, oh, sweet like heaven up above
Well, I pray to the Lord, you're the only one I love

// We Can't Make It //

We can't make it baby
We can't last another year
We can't make it baby
We can't last another year
Well I try to treat you kind baby
But it seems like you got the wrong idea

I give you all my money baby
To buy those real fine clothes
I give you all my money baby
To buy those real fine clothes
I bought you a home and everything baby
Now you're trying to put old me outdoors

When I first met you baby
You had to do it out in the street
When I first met you baby
You had to do it out in the street
I put clothes on your back, baby
I put shoes on your feet

It seems right to me baby
Since you got your feet up off the ground
It seems right to me baby
Since you got your feet up off the ground
You're a real big-shot woman now
You don't want old me around

// Treat Me Right //

Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
You took all my money and you done me wrong
Staying out all night baby and you won't come home
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?

Oh baby, you know my love is true
Oh baby, you know my love is true
I do everything you tell me to
You won't do anything baby but try to make me blue
Baby, you ought to treat me right

Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Someday baby, you gonna learn that
If you play with fire you're gotta get burned
Baby, you better treat me right

// Time To Say Goodbye //

There was a time when I loved you
That was a time, babe, you made me blue
There's a time ev'rything must end,
So now it's time to say we're through

Remember the time, the time you made me cry,
But now, baby, you break my heart
They say there's a time for everything, baby,
So now it's time we must part

Remember the time, baby, you made me cry,
And the time, baby, when you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby,
So now it's time we must part

They say that time brings about change,
And I know, baby, I know it is no lie
There's times I got to forget you, baby,
So it's time to say goodbye
