You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Without your love, baby
I don't know just what I would do
Years of loving you, you've been so true
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear
To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer
After all of these years you've been so true to me, baby
I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you

After all of the lies I've told you
Just like giving you the stars
And buying you mink coats
Mink coats and diamonds, baby
Money in the bank and each year
Each year two brand new cars

You're the greatest thing in my life, baby
Between me and you I know I've got the best deal
Let me thank you, baby, you've been so true
I'd lose my mind if I lost you
