Oh just let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, let me hold you baby
I'm trying to forget about the past
Yes, I know you've had a hard time baby
But remember troubles don't always last

Oh you tried so hard to tell me you love me
And I didn't believe a word you said
You tried so hard to tell me you love me, woman
And I didn't believe a word you said
But now I'm older and I'm wiser, baby
And now I can understand your ways

Oh, I'm at your mercy, woman
Do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm at your mercy, baby
Just do with me what you will to me
Yes I'm not asking for sympathy baby
Yes I was wrong and I must pay

Oh, I'm asking for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
Well, I'm asking you for just one more chance
Baby, to try to prove my love to you
You just say the word now baby
And I'll do anything you tell me to
