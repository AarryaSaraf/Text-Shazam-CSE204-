Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, he'll treat you so cold and chilly
It will hurt you to your heart

I hate to remember 
How foolish I used to be
I hate to remember 
How foolish I used to be
Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby
And how bad you treated me

I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
Yes, if you love me a little bit, baby
Why don't you treat me half way right?

It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
I've got you off of my mind, woman
And I've started over again
