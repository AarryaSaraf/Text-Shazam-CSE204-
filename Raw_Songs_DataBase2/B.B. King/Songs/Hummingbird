Sometimes I get impatient 
but she cools me without words 
and she comes so sweet and so plain 
my hummingbird and have you heard 
that I thought my life had ended 
but I find that it's just begun 
cause she gets me where I live 
I'll give all I have to give 
I'm talking about that hummingbird 
oh she's little and she loves me 
too much for words to say 
when I see her in the morning sleeping 
she's little and she loves me 
to my lucky day 
hummingbird don't fly away 

When I'm feeling wild and lonesome 
she knows the words to say 
and she gives me a little understanding 
in her special way 
and I just have to say 
in my life I loved a woman 
because she's more than I deserve 
and she gets me where I live 
I'll give all I have to give 
I'm talking about that hummingbird 
oh she's little and she loves me 
too much for words to say 
when I see her in the morning sleeping 
she's little and she loves me 
to my lucky day 
hummingbird don't fly away
