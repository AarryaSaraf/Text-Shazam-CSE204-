Oh by loving you
Loving you, my darling
Oh you've become
Much more than a lover to me
Yes, you are my companion
Oh you're my friend
And baby, you know
You're a part of me

Oh and that's why
Why I'm so lonely
Oh I'm so lonely
These passing days
Because I miss you, my darling
Not just one
But in so many, so many ways

Oh there's nothing left
Nothing left inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
Oh and if you
Wanna know the truth, baby
If you really, really
Wanna know the truth, baby
You know I want you
And need you even more

Oh what's done is done, baby
So I've been told
Oh but I can't stop loving you
Seems like I love you more
And I'll keep on loving you, baby
Until, until I'm dead and cold

Oh there's nothing left
Inside of me
Oh that loves you
Any less than before
M, and if you really
If you really, if you really
Wanna know the truth, baby
I love you, I love you
I love you even more

What is done, what is done
What is done is done
Oh but you know
I just can't stop loving you
I  tell you the truth
I love you more, baby
And I'll keep on loving you
Until I'm dead
Until I'm dead and cold
