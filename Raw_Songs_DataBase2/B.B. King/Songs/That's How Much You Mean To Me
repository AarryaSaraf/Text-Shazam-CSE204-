There ain't no road too rough to walk
There ain't no talk too sweet to talk
Wherever you are, it's where I'll be
'Cos that's how much you mean to me

All the money in the whole round world
Wouldn't be enough for you, little girl
Wish I could give you a money tree
'Cos that's how much you mean to me

A girl like you needs some loving
Teasin', squeezin' and huggin'
Step right up and take my hand
I wanna be your great big hunk of man

Baby, I wanna have your picture
To put it in my, my storybook
While it out big so the world can see
'Cos that's how much you mean to me
