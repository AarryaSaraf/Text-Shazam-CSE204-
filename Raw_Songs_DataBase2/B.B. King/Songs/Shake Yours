Hello, baby, I'm so glad to be back 
Got news for you, baby, that's a nat'ral fact 
Since I am back, let's get into our act 

I love you, baby, more than words can say 
You know I've missed you while I was away 
Now, come back, baby, now it's time to play 

Now, flop, roll, while I sing 
Do you know love will do anything? 
You gotta shake your boogie, I'm gonna shake mine too 
You sweet little angel, you've got a lot of lovin' to do
