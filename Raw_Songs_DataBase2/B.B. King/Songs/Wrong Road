I know you've been cheatin' on me baby
And I know you don't mean me no good
Oh I know you've been cheatin' on me, woman
And I know you don't mean me no good
That's why I blame myself
I didn't treat you like I should

Oh, I was too good to you baby
I gave you everything I own
Yes, I was too good to you woman
I gave you everything I own
That's why I blame myself
Every time you do me wrong

You got your eyes wide open woman
But you're travelling down the wrong road
Oh you got your eyes wide open baby
And you're travelling down the wrong road
Yes, a wine drinkin' and cheatin', woman
is one thing I can't afford
