If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talking about.
If you ever been mistreated people, you know just what I'm talking about.
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
And she had the nerve to put me out. 

You know I got a job in a steel mill, trucking steel like a slave. 
Five long years, every Friday I went straight home with all of my pay. 
If you ever been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about.
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
And she had the nerve to put me out. 

But you know, I finally learned a lesson, a long, long time ago. 
The next woman that I marry, she gotta work and bring in the dough. 
If you been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about. 
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman, 
She had the nerve, she had the nerve to put me out.
