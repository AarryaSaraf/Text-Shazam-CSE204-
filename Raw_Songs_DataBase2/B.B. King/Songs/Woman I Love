Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, it feels alright, 'n' ev'rything is really ok
Well, and the love of my baby, whoo, make me feel this way

Well, she got great big legs, whoo, and the cutest little feet
Yeah, she got great big legs, man, and the cutest little feet
Hey, she upsets ev'rybody, ev'ry man she meet
Alright!

Look out, well, help me, somebody
I love ya baby, oh, sweet like heaven up above
Well, I pray to the Lord, you're the only one I love
