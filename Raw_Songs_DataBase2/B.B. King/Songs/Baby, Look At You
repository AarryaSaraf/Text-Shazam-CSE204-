Well, baby, baby, baby look at you
Yes, I said baby, baby, baby, baby look at you
Well, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, when I first met you baby
You didn't know what love is about
You were standin' on the streets beggin'
And ragged as a barrel of sauerkraut

Baby, baby, baby look at you
Well now, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, you said once that you loved me
I would always be your own
And now you got your hands on some money, baby
And you're drivin' B.B. away from home

Well, you said that you loved me
I always would be your man
Now you thrown me outdoors
And said "Go and do the best you can"
