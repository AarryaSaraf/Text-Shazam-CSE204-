See, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
You made me love you, now your man have come
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Lord, Lord, Lord, buy me a shotgun, long as I am tall
Gonna shoot my baby and catch that cannonball

I'm goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
Lord, Lord, Lord, goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall
If I find me a good gal, won't be back at all

Yes, see, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, see, see rider, see what you have done
Well, you made me love you, now your man have come
