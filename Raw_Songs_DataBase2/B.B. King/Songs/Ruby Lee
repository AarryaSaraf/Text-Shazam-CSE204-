Well now I've got a girl
Her name is Ruby Lee
I'm tellin' you boys
She's alright with me
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me

Well, I woke up this mornin'
I didn't know what to do
I turned on the radio
And the tune remaind me of you
You're my baby
Yes, you're my baby
Well, you're my baby
For you seem to be true to me

Well, she never takes my money
She never leaves me alone
She's the type of woman that
I would love to have in my home
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me

Well, you know my secret
I'm tellin' you the reason why
So don't bother my baby
And please don't try
She's my baby
Yes, she's my baby
Well, she's my baby
'Cause she seems to be true to me
