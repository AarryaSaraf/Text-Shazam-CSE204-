Yeah my baby sometimes, sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
Yes I've got a sometimey baby
Sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
And when I think about my baby loving me
Sometimes she do and sometimes she don't

Yes sometimes she's sweet like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Yes I said my baby's sweet
Sometimes like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Well to be in love with a woman like this
Sometimes you don't know which is witch

I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
Yeah you may be right in your thinking people
But I know my baby's gonna make everything all right
