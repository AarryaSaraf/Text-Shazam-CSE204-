Hey baby, you ain't treating me right
You go off everyday and don't come home til night
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well I'm pickin' you up and takin' you to my house
Now you're up and you're treating me like a mouse
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well I takin' you into my house and did everything I could
You told everybody in the neighborhood
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along

Well if you got a little woman and she won't treat you right
Beat her three times a day and whoop her a little at night
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to do it
That ain't the way to get along
