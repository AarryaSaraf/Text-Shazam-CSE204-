So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
So many days
I'd rather steal away and die
I was too blue to live
And to mean to die

You've been so mean baby
You've been so mean to me
Baby, you've been so mean
You've been so mean to me
I've got to get even with you woman
You just hang around and see

Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Baby you ain't no good
You ain't no good no how
Yes, the way I used to love you woman
Baby that's the way I hate you now

Yes, you can pack your clothes baby
You can pack your clothes and go
Pack your clothes, woman
You can pack your clothes and go
I want you to know baby
You ain't no better than the little girl I had before
