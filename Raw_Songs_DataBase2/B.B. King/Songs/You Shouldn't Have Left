You shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you left the one that love you, woman
Cryin' every night and every day

Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
I want you to remember, baby
The same thing could happen to you

When the pain's in your heart, woman
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, when the pain's, the pain's in your heart, baby
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, you'll know then that you shouldn't have left me, woman
Baby, and how it feels to say goodbye
