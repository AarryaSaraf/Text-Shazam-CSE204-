Whenever I'm around you baby
Oh you don't know what you do to me
Oh whenever I'm around you baby
You don't know what you do to me
I get so excited baby
Oh you don't know what you do to me

If you just touch me baby
I burst in flames inside
Oh If you just, if you just touch me baby
You start a fire inside
Because you are everything I ever wanted baby
You are all my fool heart desires

Oh run around I'm with you baby
I want to do everything you want me to
Yes run around I'm with you baby
I want to do everything you want me to
Oh for the rest of my life
I want to spend it making love to you
