Yeah, nigga
Aye, Aye
I've been on the, I've been on the-

I've been on the run, that's why I go harder than you go
Plus I call 'em like I see 'em, maybe that's why I'm all alone
Product of the cold, but let me back up
The bitch back arched like a bow, yes sir
Leave her eyes, in between them thighs, wetter
I told you that I'm in it for the long stretcher
I thought I told you that I'm in it for the long stretch
Drunk off of liquor from the long neck bottle
Mama told me that her soul been hollow for the longest
I told her like I know those problems
But you gotta know that wallowing is chosen
I scraped my face off the bottom one time
Now mama son shine
Like the mother fucking blinds when they open
Ashes to Ashes, pray death kiss my opponent
Had scars on my fist when I rose it
Armed with intent to provoke in a moment
Not be nutrition for vultures
Armor too thick for the poking
Think before you approach me, bitch

It's 6 in the morning
You live 'round the corner
It's hard in the city, I'm falling, I'm sickened
The piggy's approaching, clicking the cuffs on the vultures
Chickens get split and get sold
Live or you don't
Do what you do for your family but most, handle yourself
Know your daddy got goals
Be a man and just focus
Get you a plan and you get your shit split like divorce
Only throw hands when you stuck in a jam
And they force it we can't afford no more losses
We all might work at the 
6 in the morning
The piggy approaching
Your window half open
You reaching the 
The world keep on spinning
You 
It get difficult not to get hopeless
It get difficult, it get diffcult
