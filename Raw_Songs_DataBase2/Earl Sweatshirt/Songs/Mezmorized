Yo

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

Yeah, yeah
Look love, I'm mesmerized by you
Saw a little dimple and I knew I had to try you in the book of love
My name's is right next by you and I knew it was meant to be
And I see you're into me
I tag "love" on the wall, was 12/1/08
With the heart and all in the bathroom stall, the rebel type
On the first flight to the Moon, that's where we should go
Just love a little lust, God please forgive me
While he hits me, look at her hips and lips, B
Beautiful like the sunset we
Together and, we see, the Sun
But we just have to run, yeah
Her voice harmonies to my life
Once I hear, everything is, um, balanced and nice
She's like ice on a summer day
She makes me think of when to stray
She's the reason I'm having a great day
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Creep on the street, that's my everything
But I gotta stop when you trap my ways
Nigga slide though

"Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn
Then paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in, thought jumped in my head
School was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (She's gorgeous)
