Album: Sapphire

// Sapphire //

I watch the day go down
Sapphire
I watch my luck turn round
A high flyer
I threw my bones around
Sure fire
I watch the current run
Live wire
Clear blue
Too true
Clear blue
Too true

I don't know what to do
I got no place to go
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire
My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire

I saw her running round
Sweet liar
And I ran the garden path
Sweet briar
I did just what I could
So tired
I threw my keys away
With no desire
Clear blue
Too true

I don't know what to do
I got no place to go
Oh the days I miss sweet Sapphire
My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh the days I'll miss sweet Sapphire

I got no place to go
I don't know what to do
Ooh, the dream about Sapphire
I don't know what to do
I got nowhere to go
I got no face to show without Sapphire

My precious gems are dust
There's nothing left to trust
Oh since the day I lost my sweet Sapphire
There's nothing I can trust
My precious gems are dust
Oh, the day I lost sweet Sapphire

I don't know what to do
I don't know where to go
Oh the day I lost my sweet Sapphire

// Over The Rainbow //

Somewhere over the rainbow
Birds fly high
There's a land that I dreamed of once
In a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And all the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Away, across the chimney tops
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, why can't I

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Away, across the chimney tops
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of once
In a lullaby

// You Know //

In all this mad excitement
Isn't it fine to know
That love is real
And what we feel
Is all we have to show
In all this gay confusion
It's a comfort just to see
That what you say
Is what you mean
The words are meant for me

Let people say just what they will
As time goes by, I love you still
You are my love
They think they know us, but they don't
They never will, I know they won't
They never will

You know, I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me
You know cos I tell you so
And I know, you tell me

Every day I see your face
It makes this world a better place for me to be
A better place for me to be
And every time I touch your hand
My troubles fade like grains of sand, and trickle away

People say just what they will
As time goes by, I love you still
You are my love
Think they know us, but they don't
They never will, I know they won't
They never will
And I don't care

You know, cos I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me
You know cos I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me

You know, cos I tell you
I know, cos you tell me
You know
I know cos you tell me
It's true

// Watching Her Eyes //

Women know protraction
As they cut it into sections
She's just splitting
All throughout the crazy action
Counting every fraction every bird that flies

Keeps watching her eyes
He's just watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
Can't stop watching her eyes

But his time is running short
Making sure of what he's got
He's not moving much
Seems so hard in this strange weather
To try to live without a lover
Or a loving touch

He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes
He keeps watching her eyes

He feels the movement
He feels the passion
Takes no relaxation
Yields only tension
They take their pleasure
They give no concession
Give no indication
You get no information

She telephones a friend
Who takes her to the railway where the water's fall
Can't think of any reason
It's just the changing of the season
So he watches walls

No more watching her eyes
No more watching her eyes
No more watching her eyes
No more watching those eyes

He feels the movement, feels the passion, feels the relaxation
No more watching her eyes
He takes the pleasure, no concession, indication, information
No more watching her eyes
No more
No more watching her eyes
He's taking the lies away
Taking the lies away

// Fisherman's Dream //

What happened to the fisherman's dream
When they rowed that last boat down
What happened to the fisherman's dream
When he cast his last net around

What happened to the fisherman's love
When they drove him over the hill
What happened to the fisherman's dream
When they laid him in the ground

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea

What happened to the fisherman's love
Was it nowhere to be found
What happened to the love of the fisherman
When they drove that last nail down

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea
The ocean and the sea

Tell me, did it fade away?
Did it fade on down to the ocean
Did it fade away
Did it fade on down to the sea

// Acid Rain //

The rain came down
I heard the sound of yesterday's TV
Rain came down
Burning down the highway
Rain keeps falling
Raindrops keep on fooling me
Rain keeps falling
Raindrops keep on getting in my eyes

The rain fell down
I heard the sound of yesterday's TV
Rain fell down
I heard the sound of politicians
The words keep failing
The words that keep on fooling me
Raindrops falling
Falling in my eyes

Every time it rains, I turn the TV on
Every time it rains, I run away and hide
Every time it rains, I run on home to mama
Every time it rains â€“ acid rain
Acid stripping rain
Heard the rain
Acid rain, acid stripping

Rain keeps falling, falling on us everyone
Rain keeps falling, burning in our eyes

Every time it rains, I run away and hide
Every time it rains, I cover up my head
Every time it rains, I run into my house

Every time it rains, burning in my eyes
Every time it rains, I run on down the lane
Every time it rains, I cover up my eyes
Every time it rains, I run on home to mama
Every time it rains, I've got to call the children home
Every time it rains, I cover up my head
Every time it rains, I cover up my garden
Every time it rains, dripping in my eyes

Every time it rains, acid rain
You can't fool me, it's not water at all
Just acid rain, dripping from the skies
Acid rain, just burning in my eyes

// Mad Dog Days //

You sit in your room, pretending to cry
Oh you seem so unwilling to try
Say what you're selling is just a lie
And know that your price is far too high

Every night and every day
I show you my picture, you just throw the frame away
With all that you think you've got little to say
I can't look at your face any more

Oh the mad dog days
I say oh they're just mad dog days
In them mad dog days
I don't care if it's true
Between me and you
Can't see it through
Please, let me say goodbye

I never get used to you
Oh no never, could never get used to you
I never get used to you
I never get used to you

You don't see my dream, I don't see your romance
You make me feel like a dancer, but you don't care to dance
You see me hit the bottle, you hit the sack
I go ratbag racing on the flat of my back

In these mad dog days
I call them mad dog days
I know them mad dog days
I don't care if it's true
Between me and you
Can't see it through
Oh please, let me say goodbye

I never get used to you
Oh I never get used to you
Ooh, I never get used to you
I never, never, never, never get used to you

Cos you, you keep sitting in your lonely little room
You never, never, never come out at all
You, you keep sitting in your little darkened room
You're unwilling to try
Pretending to cry
You're telling a lie
Oh please, just say goodbye

I never get used to you
I don't want to get used to you
I never get used to you
I never, never, no, could never get used to you

Ah lord I never get used to you
With your crying
I never get used to you
Stop crying, and lying
Oh I never get used to you
You know, could never get used to you

// Climb The Walls //

Everyone I talk to says they want go and sings your praises
With all those eggs in just one basket, you've been honey for the asking
All the company you keep
All those dreams and in a sleep, I love to watch you

Climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, you may watch the corner

I must confess it feels so sweet
To watch you fight and keep your feet
Ah you,there comes a sense of knowing
Reaping all that you've been sowing

Climb the walls, so watch the corner
Climb the walls and watch the corner

It's the nature of the beast
Want the most, you get the least from love
And I'm here today to tell you
That I savour every inch you put on paper

You climb the walls, I watch the corner
Climb the walls, watch the corner

I was so dirty, now I'm clean
Blinking like a new machine
This cutting edge is cutting out
Cutting you without a doubt

Climb the walls, watch the corner
Climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch that corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner...

// Coming In On Time //

Said she's coming in on the high tide
She's a healer, she can see
She's the sapphire
I know she left when I was a baby
But she never let me down
She's coming back to take me away
She's coming in on time

All the little children
Every mother's son
The children will be there
Every tiny detail
Every single one
The detail will be there

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time

Said she's coming in any day now
She's a legend, she's a lover
She's the sapphire
Know she's coming in on the rip tide
She's a killer, she's a demon
She's the sapphire

All the little children
Every mother's son
The children will be there
Every tiny detail
Every single one
The detail will be there

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
I know she's coming in on time for me
She's coming in on time

She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time
She's coming in on time

// Rope-Soul'd //

Rope soul'd, and walking away
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Rope soul'd, and walking away
Rope soul'd, and
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Get it right and make it feel

Sand in your shoe

Can suck up cold can suck up snow for any day
Watch them travel, see how they run
Born walking, slow talking
Tie it tight and bind your feet
Get it right and make it
Ball walking, walking away
Rope soul'd and lock it

Slipping and slithering, and slipping away
Strip it down and glisten, glisten
And Slipping, slipping

Rope soul'd, walking away
Rope soul'd, walking away
Rope soul'd, walking away
