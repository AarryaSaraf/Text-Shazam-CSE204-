// Nightline //

Watch out, watch
Watch out

They got frozen faces
They live in broken rooms
They got the strangest of places
In the dark and the gloom
Watch your mouth boy
Watch your every word
We're coming for you
Don't say you have not heard

Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, cover that door
Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, what's your freedom for?
Tell it to the nightline
Tell it before they lose their minds
Tell it to the nightline
Tell those people why

Your mama's crying
And your daddy's sad
They know your lying
And they know you've been had

Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, cover that door
Watch out, watch out the law's about
Watch out, what's your freedom for?
Tell it on the nightline
Tell it before you lose your mind
Tell it on the nightline
Tell those people why

Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale?

We got safety catches
But the safety kills
We got safety matches
We got gasoline spills
Talk straight, don't try to lie to me
Talk straight, look me in the eye
Talk straight, don't try to lie to me
Talk straight, tell these people why

Tell it to the nightline
Tell it before they lose their minds
Tell it to the nightline
Tell these people why

Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale?
Is there love for sale, I'm buying
It's love for sale, I'm trying
Is there love for sale

// Lonely Love //

You couldn't change it if you tried
Sometimes it seems, oh darling
It seems that you were born to cry
Trying for so long
But your sweet sweet love keeps going wrong

Take a chance, take a chance on a
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy
Oh darling, try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy

You been let down time after time
And now I'm begging you, please, please, please
Try to put your little heart back on the line
Forget those tears you cried
Leave them to the falling rain outside

Take a chance, take a chance on a
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy

Forget those tears you cried
Leave them to the falling rain outside
Take a chance, take a chance on a
Lonely love, from a lonely loving boy
Oh please, try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy

Darling call my number any time you please
Little to be only love
Call my number any time

// Angeline //

Oh Angeline, did you hear me singing
Singing for love in the heat of the night
Oh Angeline, did you hear me singing
And crying your name in the hot spotlight

It really don't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really don't matter, if you never come home
It really don't matter, if you take to another
It really don't matter, if you leave me alone

Angeline, did you hear I've been drinking
Oh Angeline, did you hear how I cried
Angeline, tell me what were you thinking
When you saw me playing in the cold moonlight

It really don't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really won't matter, if you never come home
It really won't matter, if you take to another
It really won't matter, if you leave me alone
It's only love, sweet love
It's only love, sweet love

Oh Angeline, will you always be near me?
Angeline, will you always wear white?
Angeline, I don't want to be lonely
Oh Angeline, please stay here tonight

Angeline, with your taste for trouble
Angeline, with your hair shining bright
Angeline, with your talk about struggle
Angeline, please stay here tonight

It really won't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really won't matter, if you never come home
It really won't matter, if you take to another
It really won't matter, if you leave me alone
It's only love, sweet love
It's only love, sweet love

// One Step Too Far //

Playing your cards right, keeping your cool
Pushing it all night, nobody's fool
Can you feel the table turning
And if you don't want me, why don't you say?
I can't live with this feeling of love slipping away
Can you feel the table turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change

Please somebody tell me, where we are?
I believe we've come one step too far

Stepping so lightly, all over town
Johnny come lately, dangerous ground
Can you feel the table turning
Playing your cards right, keeping your cool
Pushing it all night, nobody's fool
Can you feel the tables turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change

Please somebody tell me, where we are?
I believe we've come one step too far

Can you feel the tables turning?
Can you feel the scene begin to change
Can you feel the tables turning
Can you feel the world begin to move
Can you feel the tables turning
Can you feel the world begin to move

// Piece By Piece //

Ever since we've been together
We tried and tested every step we take
And now we come to stormy weather
We're questioning decisions that we make

Piece by piece, breaking up this love of ours
Piece by piece, tearing it all apart
Piece by piece, breaking up this love we have
Why do we do it, when we do it piece by piece

Yet another accusation
Just another conversation, blow by blow
In such a tricky situation
It's hard to see the way that things will go

Piece by piece, building up this love of ours
Piece by piece, taking it from the start
Piece by piece, try building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it piece by piece
If we build it piece by piece
We could build it piece by piece

Piece by piece, try building up this love of ours
Piece by piece, try to take it from the very start
Piece by piece, try building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it

Piece by piece, just building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it piece by piece
We can build it piece by piece
We could build it piece by piece
Piece by piece by piece
Piece by piece by piece

// Serendipity //

It makes no difference if you love or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game

Serendipity said, our eyes would meet without us ever knowing
Serendipity said she don't care
Serendipity said, our paths would cross without us ever knowing
Serendipity said she don't care

It makes no difference if you love her or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game
At the tip of a wink, the drop of a hat
At the turning of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there
At the spin of a coin, the drop of the bead
At the rolling of the dice
Serendipity told me, she'd be there

Serendipity told me, that I'd find her around the nearest corner
Serendipity told me, that the coast was clear
Serendipity knows I'm spending all my time preparing for her
Serendipity knows, she's close to here

Serendipity said that if circumstances change, whatever
Serendipity said that she don't care
Serendipity told me, that she and I could live together
Serendipity tells me, she knows where

It makes no difference if you love her or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game
At the drop of a hat, the tip of a wink
At the turning of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there
At the spin of a coin, the drop of the bead
At the rolling of the dice
Serendipity told me, she don't care
Serendipity, Serendipity said

At the tip of a wink, the drop of the hat, the turn of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there, she simply didn't care at all
The spin of a coin, the skip of the wheel, the roll of the dice
Serendipity told me that she wouldn't be there
She simply doesn't care at all
The hair of the dog
Slide me a hair of a dog
Madame Serendipity
Sweet little madam Serendipity

// Who Believes In Angels //

Tell me, who
Believes in angels anymore?
I do, cos one walked through my door
Just a while ago
Saying she loved me so
Leaving my blues on the floor

Just when I thought
That I had seen it all before
Life held no secrets, darling
You came to rescue me
And then you made me see
Love could be so much more

Darling look at me
The dizziest dreamer that this world's seen
Oh darling, look at me
The wisest of schemers
And see how you got me
Down on my knees
Fly away

Just when I thought
That there was nowhere else to go
Love had no beauty left
To show and delight me
You came to right my wrong
And to love me so

I know that this
Could be the day I find my star
The one I travelled oh so far
Just to dream on
To live some new theme on
A star I can call my own

Darling look at me
The dizziest dreamer that this world has ever seen
Oh darling, look at me
The wisest of schemers
And see how you've got me, see how you've got me
Down on my knees
Fly away
Fly away

// Love Of Mine //

I've been watching you, my friend
I've been watching all the things that you try to do
Got my eyes on you, my friend
I've been checking all the moves, checking all the moves
Closer and closer; closer to the edge of your disaster
Nearer and nearer, nearer to the judgement day

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine

I've been watching her, my friend
I've been watching her play you like a fish on a line
Watch her dangle you
Watch you dangling like a tanglefoot boy
On tanglefoot wine
Everything she tells you, everything she says
It sounds so pretty, it feels so fine
The questions that she fires, she fires just to
Check the range and shoot that line

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine

I know, she's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til you break down and cry
She's only going to love you 'til she breaks your heart
She's only going to love you 'til she makes you cry
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
I know she's only going to love you 'till she breaks your heart
I know, she's only going to love you 'till she breaks your heart in two
She was a love of mine
She was a love of mine
That girl was a love of mine

// John Wayne //

I believe I'm John Wayne
They call me John Wayne

You know you've got it coming
I'll tell it to you straight
I'm coming for you very soon
I'll never hesitate
I've come to measure you
I will fit you up
I've come to measure you
Fit you up

I am John Wayne
I believe I'm John Wayne
They call me John Wayne

You felt the money flowing
You watched the beast arrive
You felt your money going away
And tried to skin the lamb alive
Come to measure you
Fit you up
I come to measure you
Fit you up

I am John Wayne
I am John Wayne
They tell me I am, the John Wayne

Coming very soon
I'm coming for you
Any day now

Don't you dare look behind you
For you know I will be there
You'll feel my breath on your neck
Turn, face me if you dare
I've come to measure you
I've come to fix you up
I've come to measure you
Fix you up

I am John Wayne
I believe I'm John Wayne
You know, my name is John Wayne
Get on your horse

Measure you
This man has come to measure you, measure you, measure you
Measure you
This man, this man and that man come to measure you

I say, measure you
Coming inch by inch like a marigold line
Smiling inchworm like a marigold line
Inch my way, measure you
Measure you, measure you
I come to measure you
I come to measure you
I come to measure you
