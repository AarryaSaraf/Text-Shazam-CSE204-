Album: InsideOut

// Fine Lines //

Here a fine line, there a fine line
Oh what a time we had
Here a strange place, and there a strange face
Doesn't it make you sad
I will call up my friends and say
Come on over, make my night or my day
And talk about who's the finest folk in town

There a day's grace, here a night's space
Oh what a lovely rhyme
Take it from me, there is no disgrace
In having yourself a time
I will call up my friends and say
Come on over and make my day
And talk about the love that I know is in us all

Making the bread, going mad in the head
I know when I'm going too far
I want to get back, want to take up the slack
Get where the good times are
But I will call up all my friends and will say
I will say: Come on over make my night or my day
And we'll talk about who's the finest folk in town

Here a fine line, there a fine wine
Oh what a time we had
Here a strange place, there a strange face
Didn't it make me sad
I will call up my friends and say
Now come on over and make my day
And tell me about the love that's in us all
That's in us all...

// Ain't No Saint //

Live, live, live, live
Don't live alone
Love, love
Love, love, love love, love
You can not do it alone

Let's get it straight, it's love not hate
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it together
Get it laid down on solid ground
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it together

Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh
Do not laugh alone
Love, love, love, love
You cannot do it alone

Love finds a way, just let it stay
From day to day, just get it together
Get it laid down from all around
Its love not hate, just get it together

Live, live, live, live
Don't live alone
Love, love, love, love
You can not do it alone

Love finds a way, just let it stay
From day to day, just let it flow, just let it grow
It will get you together
Let's get it straight: it's love not hate
Don't fuss and fight, let's get it right, let's get it together

Love finds a way, just let is stay
Love, love, love, love, love...

// Outside In //

Love... love... love... it's love
Love... it is love

Love... love
It can't be no
There can't be no mistake
It must, it must be love

Is it love, is this love, love
Is that love, that's love, love, love
It must be, it has got to be
Love...

// The Glory Of Love //

You've got to laugh a little, cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

You've got to live a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

You've got to give a little, take a little
Sometimes let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

Now as long as there's just the two of us
Don't need nobody to moan
As long as there's just two of us
And we're lying right down here on our own

You've got to laugh a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that is the glory of love
You've got to live a little and give a little
Sometimes let yourself live a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

Now as long as there's just two of us
We don't need the world and it's charms
Now as long as there's just two of us
And we've got each other's arms

You've got to laugh a little and cry a little
Sometimes let your poor heart die a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love
You've got to give a little and take a little
Sometimes let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the real glory of love

// Look In //

Just another voice in the wilderness
Just another cry for peace
Just another voice full of loneliness
Just another prayer for release
Look up! Look out! Look in! Look all about
Look everywhere but look at yourself
Hold on! Hold up! Hold out! Hang in
Please everyone, but please yourself
And try to make the world a better loving, living peaceful place

There's too many fat, there's too many thin
There's too many outside trying to get in
There's too many trapped
There's too many pinned
There's too many winters that should have been springs, now
Get in! Get up! Get it out! Get it on
Get everything you can for free
Look in! Look up! Look out! Look back
Look everywhere, but don't look for me
And try to make the world a better loving, living peaceful place
Please!

It's nothing but a look in a two-way mirror
It's just another cow in the corn
It's just another gift for the Indian giver
It's just another blow on the horn
Look in! Look out! Look up! Look down
Look everywhere, but don't look for me
Get it in! Get it up! Get it out! Get it on
Get everything you can for free
And make the world a better loving, living, giving peaceful place

// Make No Mistake //

If I can't be a happy man, I won't be no one at all
If I can't be just who I am, I won't let you come to call
I was all right before I walked through the door
I was all right outside, but inside I had to cry

Low today and high tomorrow, I see that it's real
One man's meat's another man's sorrow, do you know how it feels
To be dead drunk on the floor
To get up and ask for more?
To be lying in the dark crying

If I can't be a peaceful man, I will be who I can
If I can't get everything I want, I'll just get what I can
I was alright before I walked out the door
I was alright inside
But outside I had to look again, again, again

A love
Love again
A love supreme, divine
Anyway that you want it to be
Love â€“ its love, its love
Love! Love! Love
A love supreme, a love supreme
A love supreme, a love supreme

Make no mistake
Make no mistake, its love
Make no mistake, its love
Make no mistake, its love

Divine it's love, it's fine, its wine, its time, its love
Love! Love! Love
Make no mistake, its love
Make no mistake, its love

Make no mistake, its love
It's love... it's love... love...

// Ways To Cry //

If I ever took another woman
I was in my need for you
If I ever took another woman
I was bleeding for you
Every day is another day to fly
And every day is another way to cry

I get so low in this life I'm leading
I can't tell right from wrong
I get so deep in this book I'm reading
I don't know the facts from a song
But every day is another day to cry
And every day is another way to fly

If I ever took another woman
I was screaming for you
If I ever took another woman
I was dreaming of you
And I won't beg, but I will have to try
To stop you if you tried to say goodbye

If I ever took another woman
I was trying for you
If I ever took another woman
I was crying for you
Cause every day is another day to cry
And every day is another way to fly

No little boy left, no little boy left
No little boy...

// So Much In Love With You //

The second time that I saw you
I knew you had to be the one for me
Now that you have got so deep inside me
That even a fool like me can see
That I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't sleep without you near
I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to see it clear without you

Well you move like I always knew you
When we let our bodies groove
When I hold you down gently baby
I've got nothing in the world to prove
Cos I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to get it clear
I'm just so much in love with you baby
I can't seem to see it clear without you

Getting very tired of crying
Though I'm laughing from the inside out
Need your easiness around me
Need you to tell me what it's all about
Cos I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to see it clear
I'm just so much in love with you baby
I can't seem to make it here without you
