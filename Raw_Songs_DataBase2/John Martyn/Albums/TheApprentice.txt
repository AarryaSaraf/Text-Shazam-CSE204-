// The River //

Waking up and finding she's not there
Sleepy looking around to find out where I am
Get out of bed, go tripping down the stairs
And before you eat your breakfast, say your prayers
And the early morning pigeons fly around
Getting startled on my lonely footed sound
And yesterday's newspaper is flying too
Whirling down the wind that I once knew

And the red and yellow birds come drifting by
Reflecting in themselves the windy sky
And you walk along beside them in a dream
And you wonder where they're going and where they've been
And the river's smiling bravely through the rain
Thinks everything is really just the same
And the rain comes down, and wets the curly hair
Of the children playing where your memories were

// Live On Love //

I never met anyone like you before
It seemed every love affair would leave me crying
I thought I'd never find what I was looking for
Searching for so long, I got tired of trying
I never could tell anyone how I feel
I never could make it quite clear
I never could hold on to anyone's heart
Life's everything I held dear

I travelled in circles, drunk every day
Lending myself but at slander and libel
I didn't need your love so I threw it away
I think about nothing but my own survival
I lost count of the money he held in his hands
More money just to die in more pain
How you could love me, I don't understand
You pulled me in and out of that pouring rain

Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you
I can live on love sweet love
Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love sweet love
Sweet love

I never knew anyone like you before
It seemed every love affair would leave me crying
I thought I'd never find what I was looking for
Searching for so long, I got tired of trying
I never could tell anyone how I feel
I never could make it quite clear
I never did hold on to anyone's heart
Life's everything I held dear

Look at me now, I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you
I can live on love, sweet love
Take a look, take a good look, darling
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love

Take a look, take a good look, come on and take a look
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love

Take a look, take a good look, come on and take a look
I don't need no money at all
As long as I got you girl
I can live on love, sweet love

// Look At The Girl //

Remember when I held her in the palm of just one hand
And felt that tiny heart against my skin
Now she's all grown up, stepping out and looking grand
I just don't believe the shape she's in

Won't you look at that girl
So fine
Won't you look at that girl
She's mine

I taught her what I knew about that wicked world outside
Tried to keep her out of dangers way
Now she tells me things I can barely understand
Feeds me not a single word to say

Won't you look at that girl
So fine
Won't you look at that girl
She's mine

Here she comes again, quite as usual
Looking fine as wine
Looking cool as rain, twice as beautiful
Oh she turned out fine

Won't you look at that girl
She's so fine
Won't you look at that girl
She once was mine

Here she comes again, cool as usual
Looking fine as wine
Just as cool as rain, but twice as beautiful
Hasn't she turned out fine

Won't you look at my girl
So fine
I know she's so fine
So fine
She's so fine, my baby girl

// Income Town //

You've got no work and you've got no money
You're just a little pouty, life's no so funny in
Income Town, living down in Income Town
Your eyes are so wide, your head's still spinning
Can't you see there is no winning in
Income Town, no winning in Income Town

Your hands are still sore from wild end fighting
I don't see, there is no right and no wrong you done
No right and no wrong you done
Your smile looks right, your intentions are right
Your attitude's cool, your futures bright, you're in
Income Town, welcome down in Income Town

Income Town is the place to be
Income Town was built for you and me
Income Town makes you sleek and fat
Income Town leaves you straight and flat

The cold comes creeping, the darkness falls
Nothing to talk to, four brick walls in
Income Town, living down in Income Town
You've got no life, you've got no money
You're starting to sigh, future isn't sunny
It's an Income Town, living down in Income Town

Your eyes are still wide, your head's still spinning
You're starting to sigh, there is no winning in
Income Town, there's no winning in Income Town
So kick up the heels with the rising sun
Pick up your feet, come on, let's run away from
Income Town, run away from Income Town

Lay down your sorrow, pick up your joy
Come on home, be a country boy
Just a little while
Baby just a little while
Baby just a little country boy
Country boy
Take you for a country boy

// Send Me One Line //

I feel that I have known you for a lifetime now
Though these eyes of mine have never touched your face
The distance between us seems so great sometimes
How I need your love to fill this empty space

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line

I know we never meet, I know you understand
Every shade of love and every dream I have to hide
With every day that slips away, I read your name again
And I try to push away the pain inside

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line to tell me who you are
Send me one line

I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, I keep waiting for some kind of sign
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch and I keep waiting
I keep a watch, a close watch on this heart of mine

Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line tell me just what might have been
Send me one line tell me who you are
Send me one line

// Deny This Love //

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can, sweet Jesus

I saw her walking down the street with the night down at her feet
Walking just to get the day done
Nothing good to say, she's got no nothing good to do
Praying for a little help to come
Don't talk, don't talk to me about your crying in the rain
Inside that girl is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can

The times get so tough, she could never get enough
Of the little things that make a woman smile
Another lovely day just goes sliding away
Tonight she's moving out in style
Don't talk, don't talk to me about crying in the rain
Inside that girl is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can

But I knew this kind of man, she gave everything she can
Everything a little girl could lose
If she tried one more night, maybe things would work out right
Love's the kind of thing she'd never choose
Don't talk, don't talk to me about your crying in the rain
Inside that girl love is dying again

Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can
Deny this love if you can

// Hold Me //

You don't need, you don't need anybody
Nobody but me
I don't need, I don't need anybody
Nobody but you
You don't need to say you love me
You don't need to say that much
You don't need to say you love me
Cos I can tell by your tender touch

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

I don't need your conversation
I don't need your soul to sympathize
I can feel the sweetest sensations
Falling down just behind your eyes

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

Some days I walk in my own shadow
I do wish I had a walk to water life
Never feel my spirit freezing down that low
You can come drive away my darkness
You can make my life shine

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

You don't need to say you love me
You don't need to say that much
You never need to say you love me
I can tell by that tender touch

You're the one to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life
I want you just to hold me
You're the one to hold all my life

You don't need, you don't need anybody
Nobody but me
I don't need, I don't need anybody
Nobody but you

// Upo //

Shake that trouble from your life
Love of mine, we will
We will have it as we like
Love of mine, we will
Love is pretty, baby
You know we will

There was a time, a while ago
I would have said I'd never let you go
There was a time, long gone
I would have said: oh Johnny boy
You're singing the wrong song

Stretch my reason, stretch my rhyme
Love of mine, you will
I just pull a rose and take your time
Love of mine, you will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will

There was a time, a while ago
I would have said, I'd never let you go
There was a time, long gone
I would have said: oh Johnny boy
You're singing the wrong song, singing the wrong song, singing the wrong song

Take this winter from my heart
Love of mine, you will
Check my pride before I fall
Love of mine, you will
Life is pretty, baby

Shake that trouble from your life
Love of mine, we will
We may have it as we like
Love of mine, we will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will
Life is pretty, baby
You know we will
Life is pretty, baby

// The Apprentice //

I work at the station
At the heart of the nation
I tell you no lie
I keep the pace
In the energy race
I never ask why

I tell you the boss don't care
I know that the boss don't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with the life I live
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this world I'm in

Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be good to get out of here
Wouldn't it be fine to get out

As cool as a river
Safe as a baby
So they say
So quiet, so cleanly
Shining discretely
Working away

I tell you the boss don't care
I know that the boss doesn't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live
Please tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live

My eyes are so heavy
They follow the water
Down to the stream
My conscience is cloudy
My heart gets so weary
It cannot be, it never was my dream

I tell you the boss don't care, don't care
I know that the boss don't care
He don't even talk to me
Tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this life I live
Please tell me, what's wrong
What's wrong with this world I'm in
Tell me
What's wrong with this life I live?

Tell me, what's wrong, what's wrong

// The Moment //

It could be the moment
When you tell me that you understand how I feel
It could be the moment
When you tell me that the love that you have is real

Didn't you hear me say
How I love you
Didn't I hear you say
You could love me too

Maybe the moment
That I capture in my heart, just to hide away
Maybe the moment
When you tell me that you're minding me here to stay

Here in your arms
With your heart beating slow
Here in your arms
And I can't let go

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart look away
Never, never let this love go by
Never, never grow apart of me

Maybe the moment
That reminds me of the moment when first we kissed
Maybe the moment
It's the kind of thing that I simply don't resist

Didn't I hear you say
How you love me so
Here in your arms
And I won't let go

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart hide away
Never, never let this love of ours go by
Never, never have my heart hide away

Never, never let this love go by
Never, never have my heart hide away
Never, never let this love we have go blind
Never, never have my heart glide away

// Patterns In The Rain //

You cannot hide, not even from yourself
Like me, you'll blame somebody else
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain

You ask me why my colour's mainly blue
You'll know a change is up to you
'Till then, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain

So when you wipe away a teardrop
Remember why it's there
The visions that betray you
Are hidden in each tear
If you can't believe in love
Like a pattern in the rain
The lonely game you're playing
Will haunt you once again

So don't believe you're always on your own
Your love will surely bring you home
Once again, you'll sit and laugh
At patterns in the rain

You'll feel the rain
And know it's there to wash away the pain
It's easy when your loved to start again
It's easy when you're loved

Once more you'll laugh
You cannot hide, not even from yourself
Just like me, you'll blame somebody else
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The patterns in the rain
All alone, you'll sit and watch
The pattern in the rain
