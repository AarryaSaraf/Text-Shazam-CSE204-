Album: And

// Sunshine's Better //

If I call you sugar, if you call me honey
Does this mean you've got a hand in my fate
If you take my money, if I take your liberty
Does it mean it's all down to love and hate
If you open doors for me, I'll have the manners to respond
I'll treat you like mine
Ah babe, ah baby

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better when you make it shine
The sun shines better
Sunshine's better on the other side
The other side of the hill
The sun shines better

If I call you lover and if you call me dad
Does it mean that we're in love
If you give me all your hate
Open up the garden gate
Does that mean we're in love

Tell me sugar, call me honey
Come on darling, I'll just take all my money
We can run away naked with the flames of desire
Running through water like birds of a feather
Like birds of a feather

I tell you, sunshine's better on the other side
The other side of the stream
Let's run in tonight, let's run in tonight
The sunshine's better on the other side of the flames
Come on darling, let's jump in tonight
Let's jump in tonight

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better every time you make that smile of yours reappear
You chortle, chuckle, giggle, mumble and
Swing like a bitch
'Til the day is done, that's what you do
You can giggle and laugh, make yourself happy
'Til the day is done, remember

Sunshine's better on the other side, other side of the hill
We're going to get there, come on, come on
Skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip
Skinny dipping around the scene
Way down by the river
Sunshine's better on the other side

They tell me that the sunshine's better on the other side
Better than this side, you know
The sunshine's better over there, better over there, better over there

Sunshine's better
Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better
Sunshine's better on the other side, the other side of the hill
Lord, you know where the grass is green
Oh lord, greener than you've ever seen

Sunshine's better on the other side
On the other side
Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better, don't you dare to go and hide from me now

If I call you sugar, would you dare to call me honey?
If I tell you that I love you, would you take all my money
We could run naked, naked through the fire
Through the water, through the ice, through the sun
Through the jungle, through the desert sands
On the road, down and around the swings, roundabouts

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better than you've ever seen before in your life
I'm telling you how I know
I've been there
I've been there and gone
Been there, been there and gone
Been there

// Suzanne //

A long time since I saw love in my garden
A long time since I met love at my door
Sometimes I thought I knew you
Sometimes I saw straight through you
Lord I hope I never see you no more

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometime I think I dreamed it from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne
Tell me how to run to your heart

I was holding on to my imagination
Imagining you'd be the only one
Seemed like every time I kissed you
Just another way to miss you
I should have known that love was on the run

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometimes I think I dreamed you from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne
Tell me what you've done
Tell me what you do this time
Tell me what you do to my heart

Well I know you could have loved the man that I could never be
You know you never loved me like I am
Well I tried so hard to hold you
And never even told you
I knew inside you loved some other man

Where are you now, Suzanne?
Sometimes I think I dreamed you from the start
Where are you now, Suzanne?

Where are you now, Suzanne
Where are you now, tell me

// The Downward Pull Of Human Nature //

Consider this, consider that, consider this
You've got to consider this and that
Consider this, consider this
Consider this, consider this

Did you ever look sideways at your best friend's wife?
Ever consider that sweet married life
Your mind run riot, you know who you are
Ever get the feeling that you move too far

The downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you home
And just the downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you by a storm

Ever get so drunk that you fell without falling?
Did you feel that six foot destiny just calling you home
Do you ever hear that siren roar in the night
Find that you were wrong, try to believe that you were right

It's the downward pull of human nature
It's coming to try you on
It's just the downward pull of human nature
Coming trying to take your soul by a storm
Here it comes

Did you ever go crazy, and try to hurt the one you love?
Very next day, you had to beg for forgiveness from the power
You know your pride will always be your fall
You know one day, your will will wither like a flower in the dawn

Downward pull of human nature
It's coming to try you on
It's just that downward pull of human nature
It's coming trying to take your heart by the storm

Oh yesterday, looking sideways at your best friend's wife
I know you never considered the joys of that sweet married life
I saw your mind run riot, remember who you are
I know the feeling when you've gone a step too far

It's just the downward pull of human nature
It's coming every day to take you on
It's just that downward pull of human nature
Coming to take you by a storm

Just that downward pull of human nature
Coming to try it on
The downward pull of human nature
Just trying to take you by a storm

Just the downward pull
Just the downward pull
Downward pull of human nature
Coming to try you on

// All In Your Favour //

One flash of revelation, may never strike twice
One little touch of inspiration, going to sweeten your life
All the goodness in your secret self
All the friends that you can call on for help
All the ways you have to make people cry
All the ways you have to make yourself try

All in your favour
Everything is in your favour
All in your favour, bad boys, and bad girls
It's all in your favour

Coming down the wire with your anger, all that fire no need to be
You know where to go to know where to run you don't need to
Running around a field with your head in the air
Your feet on the ground and you don't know where
You are today but it's all in your favour

All in your favour
Running for blood, running for blood
All in your favour now, bad boys and bad girls
Running for blood, running for blood

Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it, at the end of the train
Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it
Book it as you see it, it'll still be the same
Book it as you see it, at the end of the train
Just book it as you see it, it just might be the same

One flash of revelation; lightning never strikes twice
One further flash of inspiration, might sweeten this life
Book it as you see it, ah book it as you see it
Just book it as you see it let me test you, come on down
Book it as you see it, step right down

Book it as you see it
Some things never change
Book it as you see it
Some things never change

Bad boys and bad girls

// A Little Strange //

She's a little strange
Just a little strange
A little strange

I would walk a city mile
Just to see that silly smile
She's a little strange
I would walk that country road
Even though I'm always told
She's a little strange

She's just a little strange
She's just a little strange
Just a little strange
That's all, she just a little strange

If you ask her, she'll tell you she's fine
If you ask me, I will put it on the line
If she asked me, I might be so truthless
If she asked me, I might be ruthless

I'm a little strange
I'm just a little strange
I'm a little strange
I'm just a little strange

When it comes to being certain
You can tell she's not so sure
She's just a little strange
When it comes down to my smile
I swear I know just who I'm smiling for

Well just a little strange
Just a little strange
We're just a little strange, brother
She and me's just a little strange

When I come down to the corner
She's been known to walk right by
She's a little strange
When she walks down to the highway
She somehow seems invisible

Just a little strange
Well just a little strange
She's just a little strange
Just a little strange

I would walk a city mile
Just to see that silly smile
She's just so lovely strange
When it comes to being certain
You can tell she's not so sure
She's a little strange

Just a little strange
We're just a little strange, you and me, you and me
Just a little strange, just a little strange
Just a little strange, just a little strange
Just a little strange
Just a little strange

// Who Are They? //

Tell me, tell me
Who are they? Tell me
Who are they? Tell me
Who are they to tell you how to love

Is it true what they say
About lovers like you and me
Tell me, what do they say
About lovers like you and me
Who are they?

Where is the time?
Who are they to tell me what to do
I don't know who they are
I suppose they like it that way

Do they like how we act?
Do they like to see us together?
Who are they? Who are they?
Who are they? Who are they? who are they?

Where the time is
Who are they?
Where the time is

// Step It Up //

When I was little, they took me to school
Tried to teach me just how to learn
Numbed you, tell you, everything I done on me
I swear, I had to earn it
Step it up, step it up
Step it up, step it up

One way for you, one way for me
Only one way forward that I can see
That's step it up, step it up for me
Step it up for her, step it up step for me

Never lie down, don't take it
You've got some kind of fate, they'll never shake you
All you've got to do is
Step it up, step it up
Step it up step, step it up

One way for you, one way for me
Only one way forward this boy can see
Come on
Step it up step, step it up step
Step it up step, step it up

Absolute concentration
There's nothing wrong with consideration
Just love, all you do is
Step it up step, step it up

One day I saw my friend around a corner, round the bend
I said, hey darling, what's the matter with you
She said
Step it up

Oh darling sometimes, I feel I could never ever step it up
And I said dear friend walk in love, think about nothing but love
Just come on
Step it up step, step it up step
Step it up step, step it up step

One way for you, one way for me
There's only one way forward I can see
Step it up step step it up step
Step it up step, step it up
Step it up step, step it up
Step it any time you like
Step round the corner, call for me

// Carmine //

Carmine

Carmine, turn the screw and drive me mad
Come on, Carmine, everything I touch goes bad
Oh Carmine, believe I'll catch you when you fall

I think I'm just like some little boy who didn't know I think I am
Just like some little boy who never knew
How could you, how could you
I'm like some little boy who just didn't know at all
I'm like some little boy who didn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

You know I'll take you home in a big black taxi cab
I'll be there to support you before the porter can get there
We can go to my room and romance, start the fires, take a chance

Just like some little girl that didn't know, yeah
Just like some little girl that didn't know
How could you, how could you
Just like some little girl you met, you did not know me
Just like some little girl that didn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw
Turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw
How could you, how could you, how could you, tell me how could you

Turn the screw and drive me mad
Make me feel that everything I touch goes bad

Just like some little boy who didn't know, that's how I feel
Just like some little boy who never knew a thing at all
Just like some little boy who doesn't know, I swear I feel like
Some boy who doesn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Carmine
Carmine
You treated me like some young boy who did not know
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Carmine
Why do you wind me up and make me so sad, make me so
Carmine
You know there is no art to leaving no art to leaving no art to leaving, you know
Carmine
Oh no there ain't, Carmine
How could you?
Oh Carmine

// She's A Lover //

She's a lover, that's what she is, natural born
She's a lover, that's what she is, natural born
I can tell her from a mile away
She can't keep that smile away from me
I can tell by everything she says
That girl's a lover, that girl's a lover

She's a lover, she's a lover

Out all alone with my face in the sky
I'm too lazy to sing, I'm too crazy to cry
Her father told me, her mother did too
I should have known she'd break this beat of mine in two
Cause she's a lover, that's what she is, she's a lover

She's a lover, she's a lover

They come around my house, tried to shoot me
I was a fool with that little girl
I said, hey brother dear, you've got to understand
A certain kind of people in this world
She's a lover
She's a lover, a natural born lover

Her father told me, she's a lover
Her mother tried to tell me too
But I was a fool who loved that little girl so much
And let her break this heart of mine in two
She's a lover, she's a lover
She's a lover, a natural born lover

Moving on down the street, got no heart to talk to nobody, wondering why
Running on up the road, talking to no-one and wondering why
She's a lover, she's a lover
She's a lover, she's a lover
Natural born lover, natural born lover, natural born lover
Wondering why
Natural born lover, wondering why
Natural born lover
