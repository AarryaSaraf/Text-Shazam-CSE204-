// Hole In The Rain //

Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop

Come and put your faith in beauty
Try to do love's duty
Won't you help us carry on
Offer every honour, and just honour every offer
Help us carry on

And darling, don't you know
That everywhere you go
You make the sourest rain as sweet as sunshine
Darling don't you see
By just standing here by me
You make it so much easier to find

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain

Put your heart and mind together
Manipulate this weather
Help us, carry on
With the love of one another
We can still be nature's mother
We can help her carry on

Darling don't you know
That everywhere you go
You make that sourest rain sweet as sunshine
Darling don't you see
With your standing here by me
You make it so much easier to find

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in this rain we got
Hole in the rain

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in this rain

I know, there's a hole in the rain
There's a hole in that pouring rain
I can see it pouring down, there's a hole
There's a hole, there's a hole
There's a hole, there's a hole in the rain
There 's a hole, there's a hole outside
I can see it falling down
And I can see that little hole in the rain
Ah, darling, with the help of my friends

Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop

// Annie Says //

Annie says I should do what she tells me
Annie tells me what to do
Annie says I should do what I'm told
And she'll tell me what to do

Annie moves in mysterious ways
Annie says that she thinks I might be crazy
She might be right

Cause Annie says, I'm just a loony
Annie says I'm a fool
And I think the same about everyone else
That Annie just tells me about
Annie says that

Annie says, I'm a fool and I'm a loony
I believe it could be true
Annie says I'm stranger than crazy
I say: Annie you could be, too
It could happen to a bishop or a priest
Or any man that you see on the street
They could be crazy
Any woman or man you see
Any child, any star you find

Annie says: Any chance
Annie says: Any fortune
The luck of the draw, the sling of the dice
The lowest hand, the highest nose
Don't think twice, 'cause Annie says

Johnny says, Annie's all right
Johnny loves her all the time
Johnny says, Annie's all right
Johnny loves her all the time

She's got to be right
Annie, got to be right, Annie, got to be right
Annie, got to be right, Annie, got to be right

Annie says that I'm crazy
Annie knows I'm a lazy animal
Annie knows in her heart that I'm crazy
I tell you that it's something spiritual
Annie's right, I'm always wrong
Annie's wrong, I'm always right
Annie's right, and I'm always wrong
Annie's wrong, and I'm always right

Annie says I should move like a winner
Annie says she'll show me how
Annie says that I know how to pin her
I just have the don't know smile
Little Johnny boy
Cause the don't know smile
Oh little Johnny boy
Annie says

// Jack The Lad //

Call me ugly, call me crazy, call me mad
You don't know just what I might call you
Tell me a story, tell it up
Tell it up, tell up your name
Tell it up, tell it up, tell up your name

Call me Jack Adaptor, call me Jack of Spades
Call me Jack of Diamonds, I don't care for names
They call me Jack Adjuster, they can call me Jack Alive
The call me Just, the just one, I survive

I'm Jack the Lad
I'm always Jack the Lad
I'm Jack the Lad, always Jack the Lad

It's a good day for running
It's a good day to learn just how to stay
It's a good day for moving on
It's a good day for just walking away

I'm Jack the Lad, call me Jack the Lad
They call me Jack the Lad
My name is Jack the Lad

I got skin as thick as a potato
They try to skin me and still call me Jack
I got skin as thin as a tomato
Always watch my little red back

Call for Jack the Minder
Jack the Joiner, Jack the Thief
One day, I'll jack it in
I'll go and take myself some small release
I'm Jack, I'm Jack the Lad
Call me, call me Jack the Lad

Call for Jack the Minder, call for Jack the Thief
Call for Jack the Horner, one day I'll jack it in
Play blue blood on the corner, play it blue blood
I'm Jack the Lad with a blue blood vein
I'm Jack the Lad with a blue blood vein
I'm Jack the Lad, with a blue blood vein

It wasn't just one man in the lion's den
I know for a fact that there were two
Cos I myself was there right there and then
I said to Daniel and the lion too
Don't fear, you know that Jack is here

You know I'm Jack the Lad, don't fear
Don't worry, Daniel! My name is Jack
I'm at your back, don't fear the lion's roar
Don't fear that lion, Daniel
Cause my name is Jack, I'm at your back

And I'm the only Jack the Lad

I'm Jack the Lad, they call me Jack the Lad
I'm the lion's den, everywhere I go
In the pub around the corner
They call me Jack, you know that I am Jack the Lad
What a terrible thing to be
Call me Jack the Lad
One day you will, aye, it's Jack the Lad
Come on Daniel, bring on your lion

Well they call me Jack Adjuster
Just the lies they tell about you drive me mad
They call me Jack Adapter, Jack of Spades
The lies they tell about me drive me mad

My name, my name is Jack the Lad
My name, my name, my name is Jack the Lad
My name is Jack the Lad

// Number Nine //

Number nine
I wish, I wish I could remember
I wish that I may remember your name
Oh the sweetening, all the motels
Cheap nights, sweet rites
Lovely movement

The moon on the river is telling the truth
That moon, that river

I wish I could remember, I could remember
I wish I could remember your name
I wish I could remember

Oh Lord, the power of the word
One name, the power of the word
Schoolgirl days, and the school boy ways

Every day I played with the girl next door
Every other day she'd come and play with me
You can play in my apple tree
You can squeeze my lemon
You can play in my apple tree
You can come in my yard anytime

I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember
I wish I could remember your name

All the time and paper flying by
All those years, the postage stamps
Just to tell you I'm alive

I wish I could remember, I wish I could remember your name
I wish I could remember, you know I do

// The Cure //

You know the cure a broken heart
You know the cure

If I come a little strong, tell me when I'm wrong
Guide me, tell me what to do
Come a little fast, please help this love to last
Pity me and take me home with you

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing that you can do

Don't you know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Telling you that love is the only cure for your broken heart

I've been too long on my own
Can't stand to live alone
I've got you in my blood and in my every move
And though I've got it left in, the man in me forgets
What can happen when you're falling out of love

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and true
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

To know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
You know that love is the only cure for your broken heart

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, love is beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

Don't you know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Love is the only cure for your broken heart

Come a little strong, tell me when I'm wrong
Guide me, tell me what to do
Come a little fast, just help this love to last
Pity me and take me home with you

Love is cruel, love is kind, love is never never blind
Love is honest, beautiful and blue
Love is always safe and sound, love will always fool around
There's not a single thing for you to do

You know that love is the only cure for your broken heart
I'm telling you that love is the only cure for your broken heart
Love is the only cure for your broken heart

Tell it to the doctor
Love is the only cure for your broken heart
Sweet love
Love is the only cure for your broken heart

// Same Difference //

No difference here
I feel no difference here inside
No difference here
Feel no difference here inside

If by some chance you say goodbye to me
Rest assured, you'll always be loved
Better loved you never could be
And if, by some chance, I say goodbye to you
Call my bluff, I'm never that tough
That's a thing I never could do

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this heart of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine

Feel no difference here
Feel no difference here inside
No difference here

But if some tiny crack should ever start to show
Never you fear, I will always be here
First man to let you know
If some tiny difference should rear it's head and shine
Don't you care, I'll be there
First man to call you mine

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this heart of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine

One love in my life is enough for me
One love in this life of mine
One love in my life is enough for me
One love of my life
One love
One love of my live
One love

// Father Time //

I saw you, yesterday
Walking down my line
I says: I know you, just get away
Your name is Father Time

Time I hate, the time I love
Time I spent all over
Time I wasted, the time I spent
Time I've got to run away

I saw you, yesterday
Running down my track
I saw you just yesterday
I could feel you at my back

With that long black cloak and that sharp scythe
For cutting them all down
Your long black coat, a skull and a scythe
Cutting them all through town

I saw you, just yesterday
You don't frighten me
I see you every day
You still don't frighten me

One day I'll go
And you'll have no choice but to come with me
The next day I'll come
The very next day I'll have to go
I tell you, say

You're no herb from my garden
You're no rosemary
And you are no sage
You know your name
I call you Father Time

I saw you yesterday
I can still see you now
You're living in my face, in my breakfast
I can see you now

You're just the time I wasted, the time I spent
You're the time I'm left to run with
What time is this
Even I make up time, I do, I'm the time
You can call yourself daddy
But you're no father of mine

Yes I saw you yesterday
You didn't frighten me at all
I saw you just yesterday
You didn't frighten me at all

With that long cloak and that silly little skull
The stupid scythe and all your jive
I never could see you, I can't see you now
Not as long as I'm alive

One day, I'll go
The very next day you'll come
One day you'll come
The very next time I'll go

I know a friend of mine, a friend of mine was watching
Told me the time by the clock
I saw him last night, down by the graveyard
Holding on to a rock

I said: I saw you yesterday
I saw you, Father Time
I said: go away, go away, go away, go away, go away
I know you're Father Time, run it down now

I said: every minute, every second, every day of my life
I meet you in the mirror
Every time, look at each wrinkle
I know I've got a sheriff coming

Sure I saw you, sure as time
Sure as clock, sure is fine
I know that mother's no father
Cos they call him Father Time

Coming through the door
With a black cloak
And a nasty sharp instrument
That nasty sharp instrument
That nasty sharp instrument
I won't go 'till I'm ready and you can't catch me
I won't go 'till I'm ready

// Call Me //

Call me baby, make sure I'm home

I did not hear that call last night
I didn't hear that call you might have made

Everytime you go away, I think you've gone away to stay
And I sit down
And I commit myself to a deepest despair
Everytime you move around, I think about moving
Running away, making running repairs

Everytime you run around, I think about another time
I think about moving
But then again just where
Everytime I go away, I think you've gone away to stay
I think about it, and I cry baby, cry baby, I cry baby

Because if you don't call me, then I can't call you
If you don't call me, then I can't call you, don't know the number
If you don't call me, then I can't call you
If you don't call me, tell me, what can I do

Cause if you took a little time to think
You'd know, I know you'd know
I will always be there by your right hand
And if you took a little time to think about it
You'd know
That I will always be there, will always try to understand

Don't call me, can't call you
If you don't call me, I can't call you, I haven't got the number
Call me baby, or I can't call you
Tell me love of my life, what can I do

Everytime you go away, I feel you've gone away to stay
I sit on down and feel so scared baby, scared baby, scared baby
Everytime you run around, I think about another town
I think about moving, making some running repairs

But if you don't call me, then I can't call you
If you don't call me, what am I going to do, darling
If you don't call me, I can't call you, don't have the number
You know that I can't call

Any time you care to call my name, I will be waiting
Any time you care to call my name, I'll be there, baby
Baby baby, when you call I might be sitting by the phone
I might be on the bedside

Any time you care to make a call, make sure I'm in
Make sure I'm home, make sure I'm home
Any time you care to use that telephone ring
Let that telephone ring, let it ring down
Let it ring down, like bells from heaven
Let that telephone ring, let it make that call

Let that telephone ring, make sure I'm at home
Make sure I'm home when that telephone rings
Cos if you don't call, I'll do the same to you, baby as you do to me
I won't call you, you won't know my number
I've had enough of this, darling don't call or I won't call you

// Cooltide //

So cool, what a cool time
It's so cool, what a cool time
That's what you're having, I'm having one too

It's a cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, for running down the stream
It's a cool cool time, for cutting up the profits
It's a cool cool time, for a cool cool dream

Some say the world is full of fools
Other people agree
Some say the world is full of fools
Fools will always agree

Such a cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, to be running down to the sea
A cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream

That's what you're having
It's a cool cool dream

It's a cool time, out in Arabia
It's a cool time, when all the boys come home
It's a cool cool time, out in South America
A cool cool time, when all the money rolls in

Cool time for running up the harbour
It's a cool cool time, for running to the sea
It's a cool cool time, running down the river
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream

Meddling fools, give them a medal
Don't let them meddle with me
Meddling fools, meddling fools
Don't you meddle with me, I don't like them

It's a cool cool time, way out there in Africa
It's a cool cool time, such a cultural edge
A cool cool time, out with the brothers there
A cool cool time, driving in the wedge

Give them a medal, give them another precious medal
And put a price on it
Give that boy a medal
Ask him to put a price on it, precious medal

It's a cool time, out in Arabia
This cool time
It's a cool cool time, out in the Gulf of Arabia
It's a cool cool time, when all your sons come home

It's such a cool time, turn your television on
It's a cool time
It's a cool time
It's just a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
It's just a cool cool time
Just a cool cool time

It's a chilling time
Quite cool for killing
Just a killing time
Such a cool killing time

It's a cool cool time
It's a cool cool time
It's a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
Cool time
Such a cool cool time, turn your television on
Cool tide, such a cool cool time
Such a cool time for running up the harbour
Cool cool time for a cool dream

Hey, that's enough now, good groover
