// Go Down Easy //

You know
Very soon, very soon, very soon
It can pour down
And then very soon, very soon
When the rain comes
No more, no more
No more pain, no more pain
For you and me

When the rain come
When the rain come
When the rain come
Oh go down easy

Curl around it
Like a bird in the spring
Come out and just
Any time and I'll sing the things you bring

Go down easy
Go down easy

And as we lie in dry dust
Just like the evil rust
Easy
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the hard case and yourself kissing the soil
Once please

Do you like the rain coming
Do you like the rain falling down
Sometimes I love the rain falling down
Curl around it, like some bird in the spring
Talk to me, I'll sing the things you bring

Go down easy
Right now, look at the rain
A gentle message from above

// Baby Come Home //

One!
Two!
One, Two, Three, Four!

Woman come home
Please, please, woman come home

Got something for you
Gonna make you jump and shout
I got something for you here
Tell you what it's all about

Woman get home
Come on woman, get home to me
Woman get home, woman get home
Woman get home with me right now

Get you a ticket
The bus, the train, the airplane, the boat
Gotta row across the water
Just woman get home

Ah woman get home to me
Missing you so, child
I'm missing you so
Miss you so when you got away
Ah woman come home

Woman get back to me
Bring your skinny little ass back home
Bring your skinny little ass back home
Bring your skinny little ass back here to me
Bring your ass back home, I say

Woman come home
Ah please, I'm just missing you so
I can't go without you
I can't go on

Woman come home to me right now, don't think about it
Woman come home to me right now and don't think about it

Get you to take my old dog
Sat it down to Wilson Pickett
Just get your ass home
Skinny little ass, right
Bring it on [?] and me

Leap up and ski, we'll try
While you bring your skinny ass home
Come on get here today, before yesterday
I don't care, as long as it's so
Come on, I'll buy your ticket
Said it with Wilson Pickett

I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care as long as you get here
I don't care, long as you get here
I don't care, long as you get here
I don't care

Woman come home
Please, please, woman come home
Get your ass home
Please, please, knock before

Come on, the door is open
Get your ass here
The day before yesterday
That's when I want to see you
It's the day before yesterday

// Under My Wing //

All your childhood dreams
All your adult schemes
All the strangest dreams and thoughts
And secrets stay with me

All the backroom dancing
Everyday just chancing
Empty glass romancing
You know, your secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

Every long long day
Every silly thing that you say
All the weird play
Your secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

Should you ever find yourself in trouble
I'll be the river to wash your blues away
If you find yourself on the run

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

All your childhood dreams
All your adult schemes
All your strangest dreams and thoughts
And secrets stay with me

Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing
Come under my wing

// Ghosts //

I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I got ghosts everywhere I walk
I got ghosts all the time

I meet them in the guise of friends
And they all know my name
I know them to look at
And they know me just the same

I meet them in the guise of friends
I meet them all the time
They look so grey and wispy
They're always on my mind

Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts

I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I ghosts, they're just a mile away
I swear I meet them all the time

Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts, everywhere

I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I got ghosts everywhere I go
Ghosts seems is all I find

Ghosts, in my mind
Ghosts, everywhere I just find ghosts
Ghosts, that is all they are, they're just ghosts

// Back To Marseilles //

The boat for the Bailey's leaves just on time
Silver and indigo fisherman's lines
The scent from the quarter always in the air
Mint tea and majoon â€“ wish I was there

Back in Marseilles wish I was there
Smooth of the slipper as you move through the souk
Smooth feel of your feet as you slide through the souk
Slide of your slipper as you move through the souk

I'm going back, oh back to Marseilles
Down by the harbour
Same old danger, same old jive
Hoping for my fishermen are going to come home alive
Down by the harbour
Life is calling me back
That's what I am watching all the time

Take me back to Marseilles
Take me back to Marseilles

Never disgraceful of speaking in tongues
Nothing to seek for no right in no wrongs
Face of the women look so discreet
Gaze averted so sweet

Back in Marseilles, oh I'm back to Marseilles
Down by the same harbour
Same danger, same jive
Waiting for my fishermen to come home alive

Back to Marseilles
Take me back to Marseilles

Bring 'em back, bring 'em back alive
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back alive

The boat from the Bailey's docks just in time
Silver and indigo still on the line
Feel of the moonshine, change in your life
Nothing like a fine, fine line

Back in Marseilles
Take me back to Marseilles
Take me back, take me

// Cobbles //

Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles
What you think you looking at?
What you think that you can do?
I got better things in my life
Than to talk to the likes of you

Out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side
Where you jump and shout
Out on the cobbles
Twenty four on the cobbles
I'll show you what it is all about

I can assure you that all the wealth and the weapons stay with me
Just stop looking like, stop looking like that at me
Please don't mess with me
See what we shall see

Out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side
See what we shall see
Out on the cobbles
Twenty four on the cobbles
Come out all day with me

Place your bets any time you like
Guess is as good as mine
You've got your grass well cut, bushes galore
No war of yours is mine

Out on the cobbles
Out on the cobbles
I'm out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles

Hold up your hands and dance if you can
Stop looking like, stop looking like that at me
Did you like everything you see?

On the cobbles
Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles
Good clean fight, come out fighting please
