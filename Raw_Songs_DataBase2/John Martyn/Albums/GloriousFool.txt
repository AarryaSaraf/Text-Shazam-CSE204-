// Couldn't Love You More //

If you kissed the sun right out of the sky for me
If you told me all the lies I might deserve
If you lay right down and you died for me
I could not love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I could not love you more

If you gave me everything I'd never ask of you
If you showed me all the ways you have to cry
If you lay all night in the rain for me
I could not love you more
I couldn't love you more
I could not love you more
I could not love you more

If you loved me til my eyes could no more shine for you
If you walked beside me all the long way home
If you wasted all of your time on me
Couldn't love you more
Just couldn't love you more
Just couldn't love you more
I just can't love you
How could I love you
I just can't love you
How can I love you

// Amsterdam //

The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam

The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam

The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam

There was ladies around the casket
There was whores lying on the bed
There was some of them in silks and satins
There were some of them dressed in red, yeah
There were some moving in colours bright
And there were two little children there too
The wind had changed all concerned
And left this violent blue

The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why
The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why

Sweet sailor, sail through
Stay safe, runs true
Sweet sailor, steer clear
There's nothing but trouble 'round there

The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam

There was Mad Jack raving
And little tiny long haired Hugh
All the hustling boys
Are just admiring the view
I swear I was crying
And I know that you would have been too
The wind had changed everyone concerned
It just left this violent blue

The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why
The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why

Sweet sailor, steer through
Stay safe, runs true
Sweet sailor, steer clear
Nothing but trouble round here

The last time that I saw him
He was looking fresh feeling fine
I'd have known if my boy was drowning
I'd have thrown that kid a line
You never find me looking around the city no more like I did before
All that love lying wasted, just scattered across the floor

The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why
The night the kid left Amsterdam

Nobody could understand why
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam
The night the kid left Amsterdam

// Hold On To My Heart //

Loud and lovely, soft as you like
Anyway you want me to be for you
Loving, gentle, hard as a spike; I will be anything
Moving slowly, moving slower
Always with you in mind
No looking over my shoulder
No looking back, no looking behind

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
But you won't let go
Got a hold on my heart

Loving; leaving; I've tried it all
Anytime I thought I could do it
Trying my easiest never to fall
In love with anyone at all
Now you've got me where you want me
That's just where I like it
Crazy loving, there's more to leaving
And there's nowhere that I want to run

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
But you won't let go
Got to, hold on my heart

Loud and lovely, soft as you like
Anyway you want me to be for you
Loving, gentle, hard as a spike; I will be anything
Moving slowly, moving slower
Always with you in mind
No looking over my shoulder
No looking back, no looking behind

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
Ah you've got a hold, you've got a hold on my heart
You've got a hold on my heart
But you can't let go

// Perfect Hustler //

The man who taught you how to dance
He was a perfect hustler
The man who taught you how to dance
He had a sense of style
The man who taught you how to dance
I believe he had gold teeth in
I believe the man who taught you how to dance
He had some style

I want to know, I need to know
I want your information
My curiosity is as great
As is your implication
I must confess, I've been impressed
The way you move around
I thought you got that kind of form
Back in the lost and found

Oh,please, won't you tell me your name
Won't you just tell me, who you are
Please, won't you tell me your name
Won't you just please give yourself away

The man who taught you how to dance
I believe he had gold teeth
The man who taught you how to dance
He had a sense of style
The man who taught you how to dance
I believe he had some motion
The man who taught you how to dance
I believe it took a while

I have a lust
A sudden expectation
Got the inkling
Of an inclination
Got the kind of shape
Make a blind man see
Make a lame man run
You're safe with me
My lips are sealed
They will never be undone

Ah, you've got to tell me your name
Just tell me who you are, who are you, who are you
Won't you tell me your name
Won't you just give yourself away?

The man who taught you how to dance
He was a perfect hustler
The man who taught you how to dance
I believe he had some style
The man who taught you how to dance
He was the perfect hustler
The man who taught you how to dance
He must have took a while

My interest has been aroused by your perpetual motion
My approach is not in the least concerned with high brow notions
You've got the name, you've got the style
You've got a sense of fashion
Underneath that cool lover's eye... your passion

Won't you please tell me your name, tell me your name
Tell me, just tell me, who are you?
Won't you please just tell me, tell me your name
Won't you tell me who you are

The man who taught you how to dance
He had a sense of fashion
The man who taught you how to dance
He had a sense of style
Ah, the man who taught you how to dance
He walked the royal mansions
The man who taught you how to dance
He walked the royal mile, uphill
On his knees
Through his teeth, of his nose, of his nose, of his nose, of his hose
He taught you how to dance
The can can, cha cha
But you give him the big E

Give him the elbow
Then the body swerve
Give him the body swerve
Give him the body swerve
Give him the body swerve
Give him the rubber ear
Give him the rubber ear
Give him the body swerve
Give him the rubber ear
Body swerve

// Hearts And Keys //

You never come
You never call
You never think of me
You never come to test
You never move
You never think
And you ain't never seen
I never change; I never could

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somehow
Someday
Some people

I never wonder
Nor remember
Anything you said
I never feel the comfort of your telephone
I never laugh
I never cry
I never think of you
If I did, I'd never let you know

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somewhere
Somehow, somewhere, someday
Some people

You never come
You never call
You never think of me
You never change and never will
I pay the price
Though I never see the bill
It's never nice
And never will be

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somewhere
Somehow
Some people

// Glorious Fool //

Out of the west come a glorious fool
He tried to impress me with curious cool
He lied from the start
But I knew just what he was trying

He lied to his mother
And lied to the rest
He lied to his brother
Who loved him the best
He lied to himself
I believe that he lied to my children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
You know that half the lies he tells you are not true

You may come to the white house
You may walk through the white door
And may come to the white building
Sleep on the white house floor

You've come to the wrong people
Come to the wrong floor, yeah
You knocked on the wrong window
Come to the wrong door, he

Watching a person
Watching a leaf
Watching a Christian
Watching a thief
You can watch what you want, when you will
But you can't watch a liar

Even lied to your children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true at all
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true

Out of the west came this curious fool
Intent to impress me with his cool
He lied from the start
But I knew just what he was trying

Well he lied to his mother
He lied to the rest
He lied to the people
Who loved him the best
I believe he lied to his children

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true

You may come to the white house
You may come to the white door
You walked through the white building
You might sleep on the white house floor

You may come to the wrong building
The wrong door, yeah
You come to see the wrong people
Come to the wrong partner

They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say that half the lies he tells you are not true

Believe me that, half the lies he tells you are not true
Believe me that half the lies he tells you are not true
They say half the lies he tells you are not true
Half the lies he tells you are not true

// Never Say Never //

Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth
Shut up! Close your mouth

You must never say, never say never to me
You might break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You might go break it again
If you ever say never to me

In the world today, there's trouble
Look around any corner
It's coming your way
In the world today there's trouble
Look in any direction
It's coming your way

But you must never say, never say never to me
You know you break my heart if you ever say never to me
You must never say, never say, never say never to me
You might break my heart if you ever say never to me

Every time you say I'm crazy
It makes me feel so mad
Every time you tell me, I'm going astray
Every time you say I'm lazy
Makes me feel that way
Every time you tell me, I'm slipping away

Never say, never say never to me
You'd break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You'd break your own heart if you ever say never to me

You must never say, never say never to me
You break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You'd break your own heart
If you ever say never to me

In this world today there's trouble
Look around any corner, you can feel it
You know that it's coming your way
Look out of your window
Any way, north, east, south or west
It's coming your way

You must never say, never say never to me
You break my heart if you
Ever say never to me
You must never say, never say never to me
You know I'm going apart
If you ever say 'ever to me

Ah, never say, never say, never say, never say, never say
Never say never, never say never, never say never, never say never
Don't you say that word
Shut up, close your mouth
Shut up, close your mouth

// Pascanel (Get Back Home) //

Don't you look out of your window
Don't you look at me so hard
Don't try to tell me that I never tried
When I played my every card

Trying get back home, all in the easy morning
To get back home, all in the early air
Get back home, all in the early morning
To get back home

Don't you stand out on your doorstep
Don't you get out of your pram
Don't you think about my future
I like me just the way I am

Just get back home, all in the early morning
Just get back home, all in the early air
Get back home, all in the early morning
Get back home

Don't you look out of your window at me
Don't you look at me that way
Don't try to hold on to me with your eyes
Ah just keep out of my way

Just get back home
Just get back home
Get back home
Get back home

Just get back home
Ah please, get back home
Get back, get back, get back, get back, get back home
Get back home
Get back home
Ah please, get back home
Get back home, get back home

// Didn't Do That //

Some kid I met today made mention of your name
He told me that he'd seen you at the local fun and games
He said you laughed, when he asked about my health
He told me your arrived alone and split with someone else

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Not you

So I called you on your private telephone
I was told politely that my lady was not home
You was somewhere foreign, having fun
If I leave my name and number, something might be done

You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Not you, not me, not you, not me

And so I told my friend about your goings on
He told me he was not surprised to find that you had gone
Cause he'd seen you at the airport with your ticket in your hand
Leaving me to dangle like a yo-yo in your hand

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Oh, not you

Friend I met today made mention of your name
He told me that he'd seen you at the local fun and games
He said you laughed, when he asked about my health
He told me your arrived alone and split with someone else

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that it, just didn't cross your mind
You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't do it to me
Couldn't shouldn't wouldn't, couldn't, should not do it to a dog

You couldn't do that, wouldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do it
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
You wouldn't do that, couldn't do that
Tell me that you, just didn't think about it
Would not do that to me

// Please Fall In Love With Me //

It seems to me that you're not the kind
That falls for passing fantasy
It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who floats with passing clouds

It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who wavers in them breezes
It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who changes with the wind

Please fall
Please fall in love with me
Please fall
Please fall in love with me

It seems to be that our every meeting
Changes with the weather
All that we try, tears that we cry
Fall just like the rain

Please fall
Please fall in love with me
Please fall
Please fall in love with me

I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love
I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love

I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love
I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love

// Don't You Go //

The army and the navy
They never will agree
Til all the men and all the boys
Are gone from our country

Don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go my son

The proud and the powerful
In whose hands we lie
Never will be pleasured
Til all our women cry

Don't you go
Don't you go
Ah, don't you go
Don't you go my son

The mastery, the misery
Called the art of war
Must never try and foil world peace
As it has done before

Don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go my son

The army and the navy
They never will agree
'Til all the men and all the boys
Are gone from this country

Oh, don't you go
Don't you go my son
Don't you go
Don't you go

Don't you go
Don't you go
Don't you go
Don't you go my son
