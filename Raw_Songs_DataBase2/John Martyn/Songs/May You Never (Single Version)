May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

You're just like a great strong brother to me
And you know I love you like I should
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there's times you could

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar-room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

You're just like a good close brother to me
And you know I love you like I should
And you hold no knife to stab me in the back
And I know there's those that would

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar-room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight
