Tomorrow time, tomorrow time
Morning's here, sounds so clear
Birds are singing, music's ringing
Sitting on the floor, can't stay awake no more
It's tomorrow time, tomorrow time

Oh, what's your story, morning glory
Sun-shadows fall all against my wall
Just my room and me and morning, that makes three
It's tomorrow time, tomorrow time

Oh, here so soon, afternoon
With half-closed eyes, I see the skies
Sun is shining still, it'll keep on shining till
Tomorrow time, tomorrow time
