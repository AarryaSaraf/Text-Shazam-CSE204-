See that man with that look in his eye
I see him walking with you back home
I recognise that look in his eye
I wish he'd leave you alone

Could've been me
Could've been me
Ah might have been me
Could've been me

See that man waving you goodbye
I see no tear in your eye for him
See that man with the secret kept
In his tear stained eye

Could've been me
It could've been me
Oh yeah, it might have been me
Oh could've been me

Could've been me
Could have been me
I know it might have been me
Oh yeah, could have been me

See that man with that gleam in his eye
I watch him follow you round and around
I knew the time when that gleam in his eye
Could've laid him in the ground

Could've been me
Ah yeah, might have been me
I know it could've been me
Oh yeah, could've been me

You know it could have been me
Oh yes, could've been me
It might have been me
Oh yes, could have been me

I can't tell you
I can't tell you
Oh, I'm too careful

Could've been me
Oh, could've been me
I know it might have been me
I know it could have been me

Could have been me
