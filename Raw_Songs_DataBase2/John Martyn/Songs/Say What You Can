You make me shaky
The way you play the game
And every time it works the same
You say what you can, but you can't understand
It's bigger than you, and it's true

And if I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I was so scared that we might fall
Say what you can, but you can't understand
It's bigger than you, and it's true

I think of children
Something to leave behind
They keep me worried all the time
Say what you can, but you can't understand
You just have to lie, to get by

And if I should wake up crying
It's because of the way we're dying
And I'm so scared that we might fall

And if I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I'm so scared that we might fall

You make me shaky
The way you play the game
And every time it works the same

If I should wake up screaming
It's because of the way we're dealing
And I'm so scared that we might fall

That we might fall. We might fall
We might fall. We might fall
