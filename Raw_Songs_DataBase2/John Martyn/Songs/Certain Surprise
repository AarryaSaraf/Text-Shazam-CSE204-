And now the air is clear, my dear
And you're still here, and so
With a certain surprise
I'll give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Silence has never been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
My sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise

Soft uncertainty but blue
My love
That's how I think of you
And so, with a certain surprise
I give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Laughter has always been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
Sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise

We're too sensitive, my dear
Two fugitives from fear
And so, with a certain surprise
I give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Silence has never been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
My sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise
