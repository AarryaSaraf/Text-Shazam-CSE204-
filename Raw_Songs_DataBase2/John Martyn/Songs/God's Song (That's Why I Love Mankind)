Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel are supposed to multiply
Why must any children die?
So he asked the Lord
And the Lord said

Man means nothing, he means even less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower
Or the humblest Yucca tree
Chases round the desert
Chasing after me, thinks he might find me but
Lord that's why I love mankind
So stupid
I recoil in horror at the fondness of thee
From the squalor and the filth are your misery
How we laugh up here in heaven at the prayers you offer me
That is why I just love mankind

The Christians and the Jews, they had a great big jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined in on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
They began to speak; they said

Plague is on the world
Lord, no man is free
The temples that we built to you
They just tumble into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Please, let us be?

And the Lord said
And the Lord said
I burn down your cities; how blind you must be
I take away your children; you say: how blessed are we
You all must be crazy to God in there to put your faith in a man like me
That's why I love mankind
That is why I love
That's why I love you mankind
