I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name

My name
Winding boy, don't deny my name
Just wake it up and shake it up like sweet Stavin' Chain
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name

Hey mama, mama
Mama, look at Sis
My mama, mama
Mama, won't you look at Sis

Look at Sis
Hey mama, mama, take a look at Sis
She's way down on the levee doing the double twist
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name

Hey little sister
Mama, won't you look at her now
My baby sister
Mama take a look at her now

Look at her now
My baby sister, won't you look at her now
Trying to be a bad girl
Needs me to show her how

Just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
Just a winding boy
Don't deny my name

I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
My name
Winding boy, don't deny my name
Just wake it up and shake it up like sweet Stavin' Chain
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name
