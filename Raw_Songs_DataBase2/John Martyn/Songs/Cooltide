So cool, what a cool time
It's so cool, what a cool time
That's what you're having, I'm having one too

It's a cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, for running down the stream
It's a cool cool time, for cutting up the profits
It's a cool cool time, for a cool cool dream

Some say the world is full of fools
Other people agree
Some say the world is full of fools
Fools will always agree

Such a cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, to be running down to the sea
A cool cool time, running up the river
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream

That's what you're having
It's a cool cool dream

It's a cool time, out in Arabia
It's a cool time, when all the boys come home
It's a cool cool time, out in South America
A cool cool time, when all the money rolls in

Cool time for running up the harbour
It's a cool cool time, for running to the sea
It's a cool cool time, running down the river
It's a cool cool time, for a cool dream

Meddling fools, give them a medal
Don't let them meddle with me
Meddling fools, meddling fools
Don't you meddle with me, I don't like them

It's a cool cool time, way out there in Africa
It's a cool cool time, such a cultural edge
A cool cool time, out with the brothers there
A cool cool time, driving in the wedge

Give them a medal, give them another precious medal
And put a price on it
Give that boy a medal
Ask him to put a price on it, precious medal

It's a cool time, out in Arabia
This cool time
It's a cool cool time, out in the Gulf of Arabia
It's a cool cool time, when all your sons come home

It's such a cool time, turn your television on
It's a cool time
It's a cool time
It's just a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
It's just a cool cool time
Just a cool cool time

It's a chilling time
Quite cool for killing
Just a killing time
Such a cool killing time

It's a cool cool time
It's a cool cool time
It's a cool cool time
Such a cool cool time
Cool time
Such a cool cool time, turn your television on
Cool tide, such a cool cool time
Such a cool time for running up the harbour
Cool cool time for a cool dream

Hey, that's enough now, good groover
