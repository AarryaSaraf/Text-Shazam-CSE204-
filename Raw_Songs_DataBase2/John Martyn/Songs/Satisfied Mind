How many times, have you heard somebody say
If I had his money, I'd do things my way
But little they know, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind

Cos money can't buy
Youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold

Well once I was living, in fortune and fame
And I spent all my money, sweet money, playing at games
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far, with my satisfied mind

Cos money can't buy back
Youth, when you get older
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
