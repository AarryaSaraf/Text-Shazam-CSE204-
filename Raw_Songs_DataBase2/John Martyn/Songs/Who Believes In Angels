Tell me, who
Believes in angels anymore?
I do, cos one walked through my door
Just a while ago
Saying she loved me so
Leaving my blues on the floor

Just when I thought
That I had seen it all before
Life held no secrets, darling
You came to rescue me
And then you made me see
Love could be so much more

Darling look at me
The dizziest dreamer that this world's seen
Oh darling, look at me
The wisest of schemers
And see how you got me
Down on my knees
Fly away

Just when I thought
That there was nowhere else to go
Love had no beauty left
To show and delight me
You came to right my wrong
And to love me so

I know that this
Could be the day I find my star
The one I travelled oh so far
Just to dream on
To live some new theme on
A star I can call my own

Darling look at me
The dizziest dreamer that this world has ever seen
Oh darling, look at me
The wisest of schemers
And see how you've got me, see how you've got me
Down on my knees
Fly away
Fly away
