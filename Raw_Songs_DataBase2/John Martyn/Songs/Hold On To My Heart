Loud and lovely, soft as you like
Anyway you want me to be for you
Loving, gentle, hard as a spike; I will be anything
Moving slowly, moving slower
Always with you in mind
No looking over my shoulder
No looking back, no looking behind

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
But you won't let go
Got a hold on my heart

Loving; leaving; I've tried it all
Anytime I thought I could do it
Trying my easiest never to fall
In love with anyone at all
Now you've got me where you want me
That's just where I like it
Crazy loving, there's more to leaving
And there's nowhere that I want to run

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
But you won't let go
Got to, hold on my heart

Loud and lovely, soft as you like
Anyway you want me to be for you
Loving, gentle, hard as a spike; I will be anything
Moving slowly, moving slower
Always with you in mind
No looking over my shoulder
No looking back, no looking behind

You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
You've got a, hold on my heart
Ah you've got a hold, you've got a hold on my heart
You've got a hold on my heart
But you can't let go
