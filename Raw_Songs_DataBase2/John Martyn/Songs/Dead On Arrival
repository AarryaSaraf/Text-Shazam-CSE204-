Died on a plane, no pain, got nowhere to go
Broken black days you talked to the radio
Man by your side says he's trying to understand
But you're sick to your soul 'cause you know that he don't give a damn

You know that all he
Wants you to be
All he
Wants you to be
All he wants is just a heavy young man

Too young for small time, you're big time in no time at all
Buying your time everywhere, you make time for them all
Man by your side brings you here for just one more show
But you're dead on arrival, fast faded and nowhere to go

And all he
Wants you to be
All he
Wants you to be
All he wants is just a heavy young man
Heavy young man

Round about Memphis they come round and give you a shake
But you're up and away, you had all any man could take
It's dead on arrival, child and it's such a shame
There's nobody else in this world but yourself to blame

For all you
Wanted to be
All you
Wanted to be
All you wanted was a heavy young man
Ah just heavy young man
