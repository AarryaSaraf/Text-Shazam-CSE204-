The last time I saw you
I saw the writing on the wall
I didn't like it
I didn't like it at all
I look at my telephone
I let it ring and ring
I do the crying
Let the wire do the singing

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone
You know I got a heartache with me
I'm not living alone, living alone
You know I've got a heartbreak here

Just one more secret, just one more lie
I don't believe you, so don't you even try
You've been out all night, you say you've been bored
I know you too well, not to know when you've scored

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heart aching pain
Not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak again

I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I know I've got a heartbreak with me
I'm not living alone, living alone
I got a heartache, heartache
Not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here

I know my woman like the back of my hand
I know for sure, when she's taken another man
I'm going to cut my losses, going to walk through that door
I can't get her attention; I don't love her any more

I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartbreak here
I'm not living alone, living alone
Got a heart aching pain
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm Living with a heartache

I'm not living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone
Living with a heartbreaker
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache
I'm not living alone, living alone
I'm living with a heartache

I tell you living alone, living alone
Living with a heartbreaker
I'm not living alone, living alone
Living with a heart aching here
