Oh Angeline, did you hear me singing
Singing for love in the heat of the night
Oh Angeline, did you hear me singing
And crying your name in the hot spotlight

It really don't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really don't matter, if you never come home
It really don't matter, if you take to another
It really don't matter, if you leave me alone

Angeline, did you hear I've been drinking
Oh Angeline, did you hear how I cried
Angeline, tell me what were you thinking
When you saw me playing in the cold moonlight

It really don't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really won't matter, if you never come home
It really won't matter, if you take to another
It really won't matter, if you leave me alone
It's only love, sweet love
It's only love, sweet love

Oh Angeline, will you always be near me?
Angeline, will you always wear white?
Angeline, I don't want to be lonely
Oh Angeline, please stay here tonight

Angeline, with your taste for trouble
Angeline, with your hair shining bright
Angeline, with your talk about struggle
Angeline, please stay here tonight

It really won't matter, if you leave in the morning
It really won't matter, if you never come home
It really won't matter, if you take to another
It really won't matter, if you leave me alone
It's only love, sweet love
It's only love, sweet love
