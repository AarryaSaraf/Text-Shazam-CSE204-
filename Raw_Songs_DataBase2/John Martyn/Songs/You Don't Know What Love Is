You don't know what love is
Until you know the meaning of the blues
Till you love the love you had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you flipped your heart and found you were lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The very thought of reminiscing
And how loved lips that taste of tears
Soon lose their taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
The love that cannot live but never dies
Until you greet each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The very thought of reminiscing
And how loved lips that taste of tears
Soon lose the taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
The love that cannot live but never dies
Until you face each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

You don't know what love is
You don't know
What love is
You don't know
