Perch trees, pine trees, oh there're many kind trees
Sparrows, marrows and all those things
Butterflies flutter by everybody's upper by
Even the man next door can sing

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
No one that you know

Sunshine, soon shine, let me in the moonshine
Give me the road and set me free
Own up, grown up, everything is sewn up
State police can't bother me

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
Everyone you know

Jed the woodchuck, lives in Woodstock
Maybe he's a groundhog and I don't know
Winter freeze up, seize up, knees up
Summers and its time to go

Kicking up the cones and rolling up the stones
Kicking up the stones and rolling up the cones

The band plays country, cool and sweet
Everywhere you go
The people tumble down the street
Everyone you know
