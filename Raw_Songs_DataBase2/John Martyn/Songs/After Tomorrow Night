Ever since I was a young boy
I've been tongue-tied and shy
Ah in that train, just yesterday
I saw you riding by

You have got to think about position
And I've got to think about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Oh tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

Woke up this morning
Gave you a thought
So I laid down and gave you one more
I've been plotting, scheming
Hoping, dreaming
All day about trying to score

You've got a thing about about position
And I've got a thing about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

I've been crossing my knees
I've been darking my eyes
I'm in line with my peacenik queues
Well I straighten my head
Then I iron my tie
And I wonder what suit to choose

I've got a thing about about position
And I've gotta think about left and right
Left and right, left and right
Now that you've come to your decision

Oh tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night

Tell me, how can I forget you
After tomorrow night
