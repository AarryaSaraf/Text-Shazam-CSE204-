I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too

I went up the river by one o'clock
I spied that catfish, so many around
And I got so hungry, didn't know what to do
Reckoned I might catch catfish, too

And I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too

And I went down the river by two o'clock
I spied that ale, just so many around
I got so hungry, didn't know what to do
Ain't gonna catch that ale, not you

And I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too
