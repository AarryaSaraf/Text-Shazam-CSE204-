I'll take your sadness, make it mine
And leave the madness in your mind
Well you know, we have gifts to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine

The space between us growing small
Some time you know, we'll use it all
Now you see we have things to receive
Turn around, I'll show you mine

And all the things you give me now
I'll try to pay you back somehow
Well you know, we have things to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine

I took your sadness, made it mine
And you felt my madness in your mind
Well you know, we have gifts to exchange
Turn around, I'll show you mine
