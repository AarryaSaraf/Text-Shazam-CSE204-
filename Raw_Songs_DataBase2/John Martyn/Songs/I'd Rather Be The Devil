I'd rather be the devil
Than I would be my woman's man
Yes I'd rather be the devil
Than I would be my woman's man
Cos nothing but the devil
Knows my baby
Nothing but the devil
Knows my baby
Nothing but the devil
Knows my baby's mind

Well I lay down last night
And I was trying to take my rest
Yes I lay down, last night
I was trying to take my rest
But my mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the
My mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the
My mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the west

Yes the woman I love
Oh she's evil all the time
Yeah, the woman I love
She's evil all the time
She studied so much evil
Just to have it on
So much evil
Just to have it on
So much evil
Just to have it on her mind

The woman that I love
Stole her from my best friend
The woman I love
I stole her from my best friend
But I know he'll get lucky
Steal her back
I know he'll get lucky
Try to steal her back
I know he'll get lucky
Steal her back again
