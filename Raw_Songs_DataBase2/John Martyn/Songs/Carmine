Carmine, turn the screw and drive me mad
Come on, Carmine, everything I touch goes bad
Oh Carmine, believe I'll catch you when you fall

I think I'm just like some little boy who didn't know I think I am
Just like some little boy who never knew
How could you, how could you
I'm like some little boy who just didn't know at all
I'm like some little boy who didn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

You know I'll take you home in a big black taxi cab
I'll be there to support you before the porter can get there
We can go to my room and romance, start the fires, take a chance

Just like some little girl that didn't know, yeah
Just like some little girl that didn't know
How could you, how could you
Just like some little girl you met, you did not know me
Just like some little girl that didn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw
Turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw, turn the screw
How could you, how could you, how could you, tell me how could you

Turn the screw and drive me mad
Make me feel that everything I touch goes bad

Just like some little boy who didn't know, that's how I feel
Just like some little boy who never knew a thing at all
Just like some little boy who doesn't know, I swear I feel like
Some boy who doesn't know

How could you, how could you
Carmine
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Carmine
Carmine
You treated me like some young boy who did not know
Carmine
How could you, how could you

Carmine
Why do you wind me up and make me so sad, make me so
Carmine
You know there is no art to leaving no art to leaving no art to leaving, you know
Carmine
Oh no there ain't, Carmine
How could you?
Oh Carmine
