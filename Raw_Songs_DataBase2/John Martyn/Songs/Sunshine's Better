If I call you sugar, if you call me honey
Does this mean you've got a hand in my fate
If you take my money, if I take your liberty
Does it mean it's all down to love and hate
If you open doors for me, I'll have the manners to respond
I'll treat you like mine
Ah babe, ah baby

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better when you make it shine
The sun shines better
Sunshine's better on the other side
The other side of the hill
The sun shines better

If I call you lover and if you call me dad
Does it mean that we're in love
If you give me all your hate
Open up the garden gate
Does that mean we're in love

Tell me sugar, call me honey
Come on darling, I'll just take all my money
We can run away naked with the flames of desire
Running through water like birds of a feather
Like birds of a feather

I tell you, sunshine's better on the other side
The other side of the stream
Let's run in tonight, let's run in tonight
The sunshine's better on the other side of the flames
Come on darling, let's jump in tonight
Let's jump in tonight

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better every time you make that smile of yours reappear
You chortle, chuckle, giggle, mumble and
Swing like a bitch
'Til the day is done, that's what you do
You can giggle and laugh, make yourself happy
'Til the day is done, remember

Sunshine's better on the other side, other side of the hill
We're going to get there, come on, come on
Skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip, skinny dip
Skinny dipping around the scene
Way down by the river
Sunshine's better on the other side

They tell me that the sunshine's better on the other side
Better than this side, you know
The sunshine's better over there, better over there, better over there

Sunshine's better
Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better
Sunshine's better on the other side, the other side of the hill
Lord, you know where the grass is green
Oh lord, greener than you've ever seen

Sunshine's better on the other side
On the other side
Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better, don't you dare to go and hide from me now

If I call you sugar, would you dare to call me honey?
If I tell you that I love you, would you take all my money
We could run naked, naked through the fire
Through the water, through the ice, through the sun
Through the jungle, through the desert sands
On the road, down and around the swings, roundabouts

Sunshine's better on the other side
Sunshine's better than you've ever seen before in your life
I'm telling you how I know
I've been there
I've been there and gone
Been there, been there and gone
Been there
