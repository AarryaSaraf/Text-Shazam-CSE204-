Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop

Come and put your faith in beauty
Try to do love's duty
Won't you help us carry on
Offer every honour, and just honour every offer
Help us carry on

And darling, don't you know
That everywhere you go
You make the sourest rain as sweet as sunshine
Darling don't you see
By just standing here by me
You make it so much easier to find

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain

Put your heart and mind together
Manipulate this weather
Help us, carry on
With the love of one another
We can still be nature's mother
We can help her carry on

Darling don't you know
That everywhere you go
You make that sourest rain sweet as sunshine
Darling don't you see
With your standing here by me
You make it so much easier to find

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in this rain we got
Hole in the rain

The hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
Hole in the rain
The hole in this rain

I know, there's a hole in the rain
There's a hole in that pouring rain
I can see it pouring down, there's a hole
There's a hole, there's a hole
There's a hole, there's a hole in the rain
There 's a hole, there's a hole outside
I can see it falling down
And I can see that little hole in the rain
Ah, darling, with the help of my friends

Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
Between the drizzle and the drop
