You never come
You never call
You never think of me
You never come to test
You never move
You never think
And you ain't never seen
I never change; I never could

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somehow
Someday
Some people

I never wonder
Nor remember
Anything you said
I never feel the comfort of your telephone
I never laugh
I never cry
I never think of you
If I did, I'd never let you know

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somewhere
Somehow, somewhere, someday
Some people

You never come
You never call
You never think of me
You never change and never will
I pay the price
Though I never see the bill
It's never nice
And never will be

My heart carries your key
My heart carries your key
Someday
Somewhere
Somehow
Some people
