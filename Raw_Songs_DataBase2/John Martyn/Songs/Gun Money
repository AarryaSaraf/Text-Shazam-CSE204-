Give me a pound
I'll make you sound
Just like a Rolls Royce on a summer's day
Give me a dollar
Make you sound
Just like a very expensive car

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
In any case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
All my money's gone
Gun money
Every cent is done

Give me a dollar
I'll make you holler
Like a bag full of cats
Give me a dollar
I'll make you sound just like your belly's full of rats

A dead end case
A dead end face
That's what I am
Dead end case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
All my money's gone
Gun money
All my money's done

Give me a coin
I'll turn it each and every single day
Give me a coin
I'll never give myself away

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
Dead end case
Dead end face
No life to speak of
Gun money
Cos all your money's done
Gun money
All your money's done

Give me a pound of flesh
I'll make you sound
Just like a Rolls Royce on a summer's day
Give me a dollar
Or I might just blow
Your head away

In any case
I'm a dead end face
That's what I am
A dead end case
I'm a dead end face
I got no car

Gun money
All your money's done
Gun money
All your money's gone
Gun money
All your money's gone

Take me, I take, they need, I take
Gun money, gun money, gun money, gun money, gun money

Gun money, all your money's done, gun money
Ow gun money
Let me speak, gun money
Straightdown the barrel, gun money
Cash on the barrel, yeah gun money gun money
They leave you dead

Gun money all your money's gone
Keep taking it away
Just keep taking it away
Keep taking it away
Oh, just keep taking it away
Gun money, gun money gun money gun money gun money
