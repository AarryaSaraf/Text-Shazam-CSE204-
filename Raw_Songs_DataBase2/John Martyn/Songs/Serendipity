It makes no difference if you love or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game

Serendipity said, our eyes would meet without us ever knowing
Serendipity said she don't care
Serendipity said, our paths would cross without us ever knowing
Serendipity said she don't care

It makes no difference if you love her or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game
At the tip of a wink, the drop of a hat
At the turning of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there
At the spin of a coin, the drop of the bead
At the rolling of the dice
Serendipity told me, she'd be there

Serendipity told me, that I'd find her around the nearest corner
Serendipity told me, that the coast was clear
Serendipity knows I'm spending all my time preparing for her
Serendipity knows, she's close to here

Serendipity said that if circumstances change, whatever
Serendipity said that she don't care
Serendipity told me, that she and I could live together
Serendipity tells me, she knows where

It makes no difference if you love her or hate her
Whatever you do, it's all the same
It makes no difference if you just ignore her
Whatever you do, she runs the game
At the drop of a hat, the tip of a wink
At the turning of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there
At the spin of a coin, the drop of the bead
At the rolling of the dice
Serendipity told me, she don't care
Serendipity, Serendipity said

At the tip of a wink, the drop of the hat, the turn of the card
Serendipity told me, she'd be there, she simply didn't care at all
The spin of a coin, the skip of the wheel, the roll of the dice
Serendipity told me that she wouldn't be there
She simply doesn't care at all
The hair of the dog
Slide me a hair of a dog
Madame Serendipity
Sweet little madam Serendipity
