Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

It's just a trick of the light
It's just a little illusion
Take a measure of spite
Add a little confusion

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, see your memory cutting in on you

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

Now the secret you're keeping
Is so well understood
Feel your past come creeping
You know you'd change it if you could

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, feel your memory crowding in on you

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

When it hits the fan
All the alibis wear thin
When your fur starts flying
Ah that's when the fun begins

Looking back
Looking back, darling, I can see your point of view
Looking back
Looking back, darling, see your memory come screaming through

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart

Back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart again
I'm back with a vengeance
Back to break your heart
