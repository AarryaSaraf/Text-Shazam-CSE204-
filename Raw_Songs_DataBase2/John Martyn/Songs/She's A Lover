She's a lover, that's what she is, natural born
She's a lover, that's what she is, natural born
I can tell her from a mile away
She can't keep that smile away from me
I can tell by everything she says
That girl's a lover, that girl's a lover

She's a lover, she's a lover

Out all alone with my face in the sky
I'm too lazy to sing, I'm too crazy to cry
Her father told me, her mother did too
I should have known she'd break this beat of mine in two
Cause she's a lover, that's what she is, she's a lover

She's a lover, she's a lover

They come around my house, tried to shoot me
I was a fool with that little girl
I said, hey brother dear, you've got to understand
A certain kind of people in this world
She's a lover
She's a lover, a natural born lover

Her father told me, she's a lover
Her mother tried to tell me too
But I was a fool who loved that little girl so much
And let her break this heart of mine in two
She's a lover, she's a lover
She's a lover, a natural born lover

Moving on down the street, got no heart to talk to nobody, wondering why
Running on up the road, talking to no-one and wondering why
She's a lover, she's a lover
She's a lover, she's a lover
Natural born lover, natural born lover, natural born lover
Wondering why
Natural born lover, wondering why
Natural born lover
