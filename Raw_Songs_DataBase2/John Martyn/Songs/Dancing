Oh darling, it's going to be late when I get back home
Can't wait 'til I get back home, you don't want me
Reeling and rocking night all around town
Walking and talking night all around town
Just rolling and rocking night all around town
Let another man take you home
Let another man take you home

Oh darling, I wanted to leave but I had to stay
Boys would have laughed if I'd run away, I've been
Roaming and reeling and rocking night all round town
Been walking and talking night all round town
Been rolling and rocking night all round town
Let the morning bring me home
Let the morning bring me home

Well they say it's all right, we go out all night
Well they say it's all right, we go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancy pancing
I've been dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

Oh darling, I want you to try to understand
If you're leading the life of a music man, you've got to
Walk around and reel around and rock around all around town
Walk around and talk around all around town
Go rolling and rocking night all around town
Til the morning takes you home
Til the morning takes you home

Oh darling, it's going to be late when I get back home
Can't wait 'til I get back home, you don't want me
Reeling and rocking night all around town
Walking and talking night all around town
Going rolling and rocking night all around town
Don't let the other man take you home
Don't let another man take you home

Well they say it's all right, to go out all night
Well they say it's all right, to go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancy pancing
Just been life enhancing, take a chance in
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
