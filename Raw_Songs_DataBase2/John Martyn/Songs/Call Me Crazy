Call me crazy, call me sad
Call me lazy, call me bad
But you move me, move me
I'm moving on
Cos you move me, move me, moving on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Love you gentle, love you strong
Ain't no way our loving can be wrong
Cos you move me, move me
You move me on
You got me moving, you got me moving, moving on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Sing about loving, doing it too
You know I can't do it all until I do it with you
Cos you move, move me, move me
You move me on
Move me on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Call me crazy, call me sad
Call me lazy, then call me bad
You move me, move me, move me
Move me on
You move me, move me, move me on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me
