Ellie Rhee, so dear to me
Is gone forever more
And our home was down in Tennessee
Before this cruel war
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling Ellie Rhee

Well, why should I from day to day
Keep wishing to be free
From the master I run away
For to be with my Ellie Rhee
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling Ellie Rhee

Oh Ellie Rhee so dear to me
She's gone forever more
And our home was down, down in Tennessee
Before this cruel war
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling my Ellie Rhee

With my darling my Ellie Rhee
With my darling my Ellie Rhee
