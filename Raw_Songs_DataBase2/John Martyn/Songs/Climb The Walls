Everyone I talk to says they want go and sings your praises
With all those eggs in just one basket, you've been honey for the asking
All the company you keep
All those dreams and in a sleep, I love to watch you

Climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, you may watch the corner

I must confess it feels so sweet
To watch you fight and keep your feet
Ah you,there comes a sense of knowing
Reaping all that you've been sowing

Climb the walls, so watch the corner
Climb the walls and watch the corner

It's the nature of the beast
Want the most, you get the least from love
And I'm here today to tell you
That I savour every inch you put on paper

You climb the walls, I watch the corner
Climb the walls, watch the corner

I was so dirty, now I'm clean
Blinking like a new machine
This cutting edge is cutting out
Cutting you without a doubt

Climb the walls, watch the corner
Climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch that corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner
You may climb the walls, watch the corner...
