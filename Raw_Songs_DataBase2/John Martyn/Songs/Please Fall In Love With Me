It seems to me that you're not the kind
That falls for passing fantasy
It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who floats with passing clouds

It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who wavers in them breezes
It seems to me that you're not the kind
Who changes with the wind

Please fall
Please fall in love with me
Please fall
Please fall in love with me

It seems to be that our every meeting
Changes with the weather
All that we try, tears that we cry
Fall just like the rain

Please fall
Please fall in love with me
Please fall
Please fall in love with me

I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love
I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love

I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love
I want to fall in love with the world
I want the world to fall in love
