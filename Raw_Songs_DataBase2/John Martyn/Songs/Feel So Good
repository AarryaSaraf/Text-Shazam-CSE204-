Really gotta tell you today that I feel so good, gotta tell somebody
I feel so good every time you say you love me
I feel so good every time you say you care
I feel so good every time you say you love me
It just feel so good to know that you are there

Oh never think about leaving me, oh how this child would cry
Never think about leaving this boy
Can you imagine, imagine, imagine the hue and cry?
I feel so good

I just feel so good when you tell me that your mine
I feel so good, so happy, every time you say you love me
I feel so good when you're giving me your time

Don't you ever think about leaving, oh no
Oh my the hue and cry, don't cry
Never think about leaving this boy
Some part of my heart might just up and die

I just feel so good to see you smiling sweetly
I just feel so good when you cause my sun to shine
I feel so good I just have to cry discreetly
I feel so good 'cause you make me feel divine

Don't ever think about leaving this boy, imagine the hue and cry
Don't you ever think about leaving this boy
Oh please never even try
Oh please don't you never even try

I feel so good every time you say you love me
I feel so good every time you say you care
I feel so good every time you say you love me
It just feel so good to know that you are there

Don't ever think about leaving, how this child might cry
Don't ever think about leaving me, oh the hue and cry
Oh please don't ever try
Don't you leave me child, 'cause I feel so good
I feel so good, I just feel so good
I just feel so good
