Tell me, tell me
Who are they? Tell me
Who are they? Tell me
Who are they to tell you how to love

Is it true what they say
About lovers like you and me
Tell me, what do they say
About lovers like you and me
Who are they?

Where is the time?
Who are they to tell me what to do
I don't know who they are
I suppose they like it that way

Do they like how we act?
Do they like to see us together?
Who are they? Who are they?
Who are they? Who are they? who are they?

Where the time is
Who are they?
Where the time is
