Ever since we've been together
We tried and tested every step we take
And now we come to stormy weather
We're questioning decisions that we make

Piece by piece, breaking up this love of ours
Piece by piece, tearing it all apart
Piece by piece, breaking up this love we have
Why do we do it, when we do it piece by piece

Yet another accusation
Just another conversation, blow by blow
In such a tricky situation
It's hard to see the way that things will go

Piece by piece, building up this love of ours
Piece by piece, taking it from the start
Piece by piece, try building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it piece by piece
If we build it piece by piece
We could build it piece by piece

Piece by piece, try building up this love of ours
Piece by piece, try to take it from the very start
Piece by piece, try building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it

Piece by piece, just building up this love we have
I know we can do it, if we do it piece by piece
We can build it piece by piece
We could build it piece by piece
Piece by piece by piece
Piece by piece by piece
