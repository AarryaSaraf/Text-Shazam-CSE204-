Running jumping standing still a ghoul up there
Some goon up on Glastonbury Tor
Been itching

The cat can't work tonight
The cat just will not work tonight
I know that the cat won't work tonight
I tell you this cat won't work tonight

You can watch the sun fall in to my sweetest embrace
You can even try to show me some baptist better place
You can watch me as I try to fly
Watch the stars as your heart tries not to cry

The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight
I'm telling you, the cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight
The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight

Been itching, been scratching, been stopping, been starting
Got a face like a hatchet, mother like a spanner with a half shut knife
Out on the tiles with me all the time
Walking, fooling, child's and wives

The cat won't work, won't work tonight
I tell you the cat won't work, won't work tonight, oh no
The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight

Running, jumping, standing still
Like a goon up there on Goon Hilly Down
Watch the dilly dilly run, huh, let them talents fall down

The cat won't work, the cat won't work tonight, I'm telling you
The cat can't work, the cat can't work tonight
Looking like a cat's paw, feeling like a rabbits foot
Maybe get lucky but it must be good
The cat can't work, the cat don't work tonight

Too busy itching and scratching, looking the patch right over
Too busy scratching and itching, looking out for bitching
I tell you now the cat don't work
The cat don't work tonight
The cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight
The cat don't work, the cat don't work tonight

Some other time, send me a line
Too busy itching, scratching, bitching, hatching plots and schemes and plans
Just can't work
The cat don't work, the can don't work tonight
