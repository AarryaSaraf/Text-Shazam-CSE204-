He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey, still won't give me none

He's got all the money
He's got all the money
He's got all the money, but he just won't give me none

He's got all the women
He's got all the women
He's got all the women, but he doesn't give me one

He's got all the power
He's got all the power
He's got all the power, he won't give me none

Now he's got religion
He's even got religion
He's even got religion, but he just can't teach me one

He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey
He's got all the whiskey, won't give me none
Won't give me none; not even won't give me none
