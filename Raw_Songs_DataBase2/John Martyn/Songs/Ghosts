I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I got ghosts everywhere I walk
I got ghosts all the time

I meet them in the guise of friends
And they all know my name
I know them to look at
And they know me just the same

I meet them in the guise of friends
I meet them all the time
They look so grey and wispy
They're always on my mind

Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts

I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I ghosts, they're just a mile away
I swear I meet them all the time

Ghosts, they're everywhere
Ghosts, everywhere

I got ghosts in my memory
I got ghosts in my mind
I got ghosts everywhere I go
Ghosts seems is all I find

Ghosts, in my mind
Ghosts, everywhere I just find ghosts
Ghosts, that is all they are, they're just ghosts
