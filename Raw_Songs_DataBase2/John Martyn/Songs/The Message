Every day and all night
I'm trying to tell you're all right
Every day and every night
I try to tell you it's black and white

And though I know it's your life and your time
And I know that it makes you feel fine
Don't you know that it's wrong
If you let life do that to you, love

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi

Every day and all night
You're trying to tell me you're all right
Every day and all night
You're trying to tell me it's black and white

And though I know that it makes you feel fine
And I know it's your life and your time
Don't you know that it's wrong
If you let life do that to you, love

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi
