Well I cannot be your lover
And I will not be your friend
Well I know you say you need me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
I just end up getting bored
Cos no-one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Do you think that you could leave me
Could you leave and go away
Just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you
Could I leave and go away
Just for a change of style?

They tell me that they dig my shit
So I sell it to them cheap
They bring their scales and check the deal
Are you scared that I might cheat?
Well you're just the spit and polish on a fat man's shiny shoe
And I think I'd hate them for it
And I think they hate me too

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Well you spend your whole life moaning
Down the telephone for bread
You can't get your sleep for trying
To remember what you said
You come around most anytime
And sell me what you can
What you see is what you get
Catch me if you can

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Do you think that you could leave me
Could you leave and go away
Just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you
Could I leave and go away
Just for a change of style?

Well I cannot be your lover
And I will not be a friend
Well I know you say you're leaving me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
But just end up getting bored
Cos no one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score

Let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
