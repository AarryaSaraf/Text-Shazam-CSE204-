Sometimes I wish that I had never seen your face
Sometimes I wish that you would never show me to the place
Sometimes I wish that I could be better than I am
Sometimes I wish that I was still your loving man

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You take me so high
You leave me so low

A cool cool time
For running up the harbour
It's a cool cool time
For going to see your father
A cool cool time
For running on the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For a place you never been before

You never been before
You never been before
You never been before

And now you set me up and you leave me on the road
For all the love we had I just don't have a line
You tell me all those years were just a waste of time

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You take me so high
You leave me so low

It's a cool cool time
For running up the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For a scene you never seen before
A cool cool time
For running up the harbour
Such a cool cool time
For going to see your father

You take me so high
You leave me so low
You leave me so high
You take me, take me down so low

It's a a cool cool time
For running up the sea shore
Such a cool cool time
For something you never seen before
It's a cool cool time
For running up the harbour
A cool cool time
For going to see my father

Go and see my father
Go see my father
Go see my father

Go see, go see, go see, go see
Go see, go see, go see, go see

Allo blondini!
Sullo percussion
El basso profundo
I grosso con petito
E con avante
Un avanta la guarda

Si el dentisto rorcho
Extramarito el dentisto
Removo el conno
Give it some spico
El porto al niente
Al dente!

You take me
You leave me
You take me
You leave me
