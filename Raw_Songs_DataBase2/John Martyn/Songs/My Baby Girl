My baby girl
She's the sweetest in the whole wide world
She wears her hair way up in a curl
Just to show she's my very own baby girl

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy will you try for me

My little Miss Wisp
She makes my heart feel tight like a fist
A number one girl in most every way
When she pulls my strings, you've got to give her her say

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy go and try for me

My tiny dream
She makes me feel like a cat with her cream
She shines and bubbles like the clearest of streams
She makes me know it's not as bad as it sometimes seems

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy go and try for me

My baby girl
She's just my baby girl
