One day our laughter comes flowing with the rain
And on the very next day, our sorrow sees us crying again
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can roll and tumble until the cow come home

Sometimes our story's just too beautiful to tell
Like the bells on a Sunday, blues on a Monday, go together well
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home

Sometimes, some kind of sadness shows upon your face
Sometimes, some kind of madness tries to take my place
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
And I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home

One day our laughter comes flowing with the rain
And on the very next day our laughter sees us crying again
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
And I can discover the lover in thee
I can discover the lover in thee
You can discover the lover in me
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home
