Saw the ocean
Said of it
Nothing's bigger than this
Took the sea flowers
From the sand
Held the shells in my hand

Let it be the
Let it be the friend
Oh let the sea my troubles mend
Let the sea
Let the sea
Let the sea my troubles mend

Let the wind
Blow through my hair
A speck of dust is standing there
Yes I saw the ocean
Said of it
Nothing's bigger than this

Let it be the
Let it be the friend
Let the sea my troubles mend
Let the sea
Let the sea
Let the sea my troubles mend
