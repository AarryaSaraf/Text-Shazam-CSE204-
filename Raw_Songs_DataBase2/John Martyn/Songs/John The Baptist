I'm John the baptist and this is my friend Salome
And you can bet it's my head she wants and not my heart only
If you see me smiling and you wonder why
You can bet it's a private joke between her and I

And it's all alright
Everything's alright
Alright
Everything's alright

She dances for me in the midnight moon
And when I play for her she never sings too soon
When my head's cut off and I'm lying on the plate
I'm going to grin and tell myself it's been a lovely wait

With the revelations granted and my face just? like a? haunted
See myself on the nursery wall on a poster reading 'Wanted'
And there's a big reward for bringing me in
And I know in my very heart I committed no sin
