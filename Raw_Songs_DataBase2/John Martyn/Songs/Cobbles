Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles
What you think you looking at?
What you think that you can do?
I got better things in my life
Than to talk to the likes of you

Out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side
Where you jump and shout
Out on the cobbles
Twenty four on the cobbles
I'll show you what it is all about

I can assure you that all the wealth and the weapons stay with me
Just stop looking like, stop looking like that at me
Please don't mess with me
See what we shall see

Out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side
See what we shall see
Out on the cobbles
Twenty four on the cobbles
Come out all day with me

Place your bets any time you like
Guess is as good as mine
You've got your grass well cut, bushes galore
No war of yours is mine

Out on the cobbles
Out on the cobbles
I'm out on the cobbles
Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles

Hold up your hands and dance if you can
Stop looking like, stop looking like that at me
Did you like everything you see?

On the cobbles
Sixteen on the side, twenty four on the cobbles
Good clean fight, come out fighting please
