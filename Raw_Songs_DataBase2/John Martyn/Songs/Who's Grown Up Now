On this June morning
I give you warning
I might just fly away across the dawn
I looked into my lover's eyes
There I saw the sunrise
There I saw the birth of something new

And suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
'Cause I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

Since the time she went away
I just exist from day to day
I can't live, I can't love without her near
Sitting here in my darkened room
Whistling through the velvet gloom
Wondering what the hell I'm doing here

For suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
And I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

There's just me and my conscience now
There's no one to tell me why or how
I fell away; it's time I must return
We might recover what has been
Turn all the pieces round again
Change and rearrange, begin again

And suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
'Cause I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her

On this June morning
I give you warning
I might just fly away across the dawn
Since the day she went away
I just exist from day to day
I can't live, I can't love without her near

For suddenly, I'm not the same little boy
And I can't see the people that I meet
All I see is her
